S01E01,Winter Is Coming,1,"Easy, boy."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,2,What do you expect? They're savages.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,3,"One lot steals a goat from another lot,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,4,before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,5,I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,6,"I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,7,How close did you get?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,8,- Close as any man would. - We should head back to the Wall.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,9,Do the dead frighten you?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,10,Our orders were to track the wildlings.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,11,We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,12,You don't think he'll ask us how they died?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,13,Get back on your horse.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,14,Whatever did it to them could do it to us.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,15,They even killed the children.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,16,It's a good thing we're not children.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,17,"You want to run away south, run away."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,18,"Of course, they will behead you as a deserter."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,19,If I don't catch you first.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,20,Get back on your horse.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,21,I won't say it again.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,22,Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,23,They were here.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,24,See where they went.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,25,What is it?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,26,It's...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,27,"Go on, Father's watching."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,28,And your mother.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,29,"Fine work, as always. Well done."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,30,Thank you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,31,I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,32,Quite beautiful.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,33,The stitching...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,34,"Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very..."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,35,- It's beautiful. - Thank you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,36,And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,37,"Keep practicing, Bran."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,38,Go on.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,39,"Don't think too much, Bran."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,40,Relax your bow arm.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,41,"- Quick, Bran! - Faster."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,42,Lord Stark!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,43,My lady.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,44,A guardsman just rode in from the hills.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,45,They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,46,Get the lads to saddle their horses.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,47,Do you have to?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,48,"He swore an oath, Cat."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,49,"Law is law, my lady."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,50,Tell Bran he's coming too.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,51,Ned.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,52,Ten is too young to see such things.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,53,He won't be a boy forever.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,54,And winter is coming.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,55,"Good lad, go run back and get the rest."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,56,White walkers.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,57,I saw the white walkers.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,58,White walkers.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,59,"The white walkers, I saw them."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,60,I know I broke my oath.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,61,And I know I'm a deserter.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,62,"I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but..."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,63,I saw what I saw.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,64,I saw the white walkers.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,65,People need to know.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,66,If you can get word to my family...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,67,tell them I'm no coward.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,68,Tell them I'm sorry.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,69,"Forgive me, Lord."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,70,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,71,- the first of his name... - Don't look away.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,72,...King of the Andals and the First Men... - Father will know if you do.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,73,"...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,74,"I, Eddard of the House Stark,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,75,"Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,76,sentence you to die.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,77,You did well.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,78,You understand why I did it?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,79,Jon said he was a deserter.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,80,But do you understand why I had to kill him?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,81,"""Our way is the old way""?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,82,The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,83,Is it true he saw the white walkers?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,84,The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,85,So he was lying?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,86,A madman sees what he sees.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,87,What is it?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,88,Mountain lion?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,89,There are no mountain lions in these woods.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,90,It's a freak.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,91,It's a direwolf.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,92,Tough old beast.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,93,There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,94,Now there are five.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,95,You want to hold it?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,96,Where will they go?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,97,Their mother's dead.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,98,They don't belong down here.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,99,Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,100,- Right. Give it here. - No!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,101,Put away your blade.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,102,"- I take orders from your father, not you. - Please, Father!"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,103,"I'm sorry, Bran."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,104,Lord Stark?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,105,There are five pups.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,106,One for each of the Stark children.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,107,The direwolf is the sigil of your house.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,108,They were meant to have them.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,109,You will train them yourselves.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,110,You will feed them yourselves.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,111,"And if they die, you will bury them yourselves."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,112,What about you?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,113,I'm not a Stark.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,114,Get on.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,115,What is it?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,116,"The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,117,"As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you..."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,118,you worry too much.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,119,- It's starting to show. - And you never worry about anything.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,120,"When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,121,100-foot drop into the water... you were never afraid.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,122,There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,123,"""We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."""
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,124,- What if Jon Arryn told someone? - But who would he tell?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,125,My husband.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,126,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,127,"Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,128,"And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,129,someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,130,Or is it the other way around?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,131,And life will go on.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,132,You should be the Hand of the King.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,133,That's an honour I can do without.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,134,"Their days are too long,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,135,their lives are too short.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,136,"All these years,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,137,and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,138,You have five northern children.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,139,You're not an outsider.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,140,I wonder if the old gods agree.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,141,It's your gods with all the rules.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,142,"I am so sorry, my love."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,143,- Tell me. - There was a raven from King's Landing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,144,Jon Arryn is dead.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,145,A fever took him.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,146,I know he was like a father to you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,147,"- Your sister, the boy? - They both have their health,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,148,gods be good.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,149,The raven brought more news.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,150,The king rides for Winterfell...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,151,with the queen and all the rest of them.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,152,If he's coming this far north...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,153,there's only one thing he's after.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,154,"You can always say no, Ned."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,155,We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,156,- I'm told he reads all night. - I'm told he drinks all night.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,157,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,158,stature?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,159,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,160,Perhaps we'll find out.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,161,"In any case, candles."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,162,Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,163,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's a sleek bit of mink."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,164,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,165,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,166,"Go on, Tommy, shear him good."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,167,He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,168,"Gods, but they grow fast."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,169,Brandon!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,170,I saw the king. He's got hundreds of people.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,171,How many times have I told you? No climbing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,172,"But he's coming right now, down our road."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,173,"I want you to promise me,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,174,no more climbing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,175,I promise.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,176,- Do you know what? - What?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,177,You always look at your feet before you lie.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,178,Run and find your father.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,179,Tell him the king is close.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,180,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,181,"- Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Oh."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,182,What are you doing with that on?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,183,Go on.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,184,Move!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,185,Your Grace.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,186,You've got fat.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,187,- Cat! - Your Grace.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,188,Nine years... Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,189,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,190,- Where's the Imp? - Will you shut up?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,191,Who have we here?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,192,You must be Robb.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,193,"My, you're a pretty one."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,194,Your name is?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,195,Arya.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,196,"Oh, show us your muscles."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,197,You'll be a soldier.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,198,"That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,199,Would you please shut up?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,200,My queen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,201,My queen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,202,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,203,"We've been riding for a month, my love."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,204,Surely the dead can wait.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,205,Ned.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,206,Where's the Imp?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,207,Where is our brother?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,208,Go and find the little beast.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,209,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,210,One minute he was fine and then...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,211,"burned right through him, whatever it was."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,212,I loved that man.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,213,We both did.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,214,"He never had to teach you much, but me? You remember me at 16?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,215,All I wanted to do
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,216,was crack skulls and fuck girls.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,217,- He showed me what was what. - Aye.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,218,Don't look at me like that. It's not his fault I didn't listen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,219,"I need you, Ned,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,220,"down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,221,Lord Eddard Stark...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,222,I would name you the Hand of the King.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,223,I'm not worthy of the honour.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,224,I'm not trying to honour you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,225,I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,226,"while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,227,"Damn it, Ned, stand up."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,228,"You helped me win the Iron Throne,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,229,now help me keep the damn thing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,230,We were meant to rule together.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,231,"If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,232,"Well, it's not too late."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,233,"I have a son, you have a daughter."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,234,We'll join our houses.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,235,It is true what they say about the northern girls.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,236,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,237,I did hear something about that.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,238,And the queen and her twin brother.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,239,They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,240,And the other brother?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,241,- The queen has two brothers? - There's the pretty one...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,242,and there's the clever one.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,243,Mmm...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,244,I hear they call him the Imp.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,245,I hear he hates that nickname.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,246,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,247,"I hear he's a drunken little lecher,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,248,prone to all manner of perversions.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,249,Clever girl.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,250,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,251,Have you?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,252,- Already? - Oh!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,253,The gods gave me one blessing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,254,- Don't get up. - My lord.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,255,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,256,"You have much to teach me, no doubt,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,257,but our sister craves your attention.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,258,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,259,A family trait.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,260,"Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,261,"- Don't leave me alone with these people. - I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,262,And this is the first of many courses.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,263,I thought you might say that.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,264,But since we're short on time...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,265,"Come on, girls."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,266,See you at sundown.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,267,Close the door!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,268,Did you have to bury her in a place like this?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,269,She should be on a hill somewhere
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,270,with the sun and the clouds above her.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,271,She was my sister.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,272,This is where she belongs.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,273,She belonged with me.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,274,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,275,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,276,Not all of them.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,277,Daenerys!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,278,Daenerys.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,279,There's our bride-to-be.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,280,"Look, a gift from Illyrio."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,281,Touch it.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,282,"Go on, feel the fabric."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,283,Mmm.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,284,Isn't he a gracious host?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,285,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,286,Illyrio's no fool.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,287,He knows I won't forget my friends
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,288,when I come into my throne.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,289,You still slouch.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,290,Let them see.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,291,You have a woman's body now.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,292,I need you to be perfect today.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,293,Can you do that for me?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,294,"You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,295,No.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,296,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,297,they will say it began today.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,298,"It's too hot, my lady."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,299,Where is he?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,300,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,301,"Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,302,May I present my honoured guests?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,303,"Viserys of House Targaryen,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,304,"the third of his name,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,305,"the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,306,"and his sister,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,307,Daenerys of House Targaryen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,308,Do you see how long his hair is?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,309,When Dothraki are defeated in combat
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,310,they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,311,Khal Drogo has never been defeated.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,312,"He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,313,And you will be his queen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,314,"Come forward, my dear."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,315,Where is he going?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,316,- The ceremony is over. - But he... But he didn't say anything.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,317,Did he like her?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,318,"Trust me, Your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,319,It won't be long now.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,320,Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father's throne.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,321,The people drink secret toasts to your health.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,322,They cry out for their true king.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,323,When will they be married?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,324,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,325,Is it true they lie with their horses?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,326,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,327,Do you take me for a fool?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,328,I take you for a king.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,329,Kings lack the caution of common men.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,330,My apologies if I've given offence.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,331,I know how to play a man like Drogo.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,332,I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,333,I don't want to be his queen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,334,I want to go home.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,335,So do I.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,336,"I want us both to go home,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,337,but they took it from us.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,338,"So tell me, sweet sister,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,339,how do we go home?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,340,I don't know.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,341,We go home with an army.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,342,With Khal Drogo's army.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,343,"I would let his whole tribe fuck you,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,344,"all 40,000 men and their horses too,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,345,if that's what it took.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,346,Do you think Joffrey will like me?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,347,What if he thinks I'm ugly?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,348,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,349,He's so handsome.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,350,When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,351,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,352,Why would he say no?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,353,He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,354,He'd have to leave home.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,355,He'd have to leave me.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,356,And so would you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,357,You left your home to come here.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,358,And I'd be queen someday.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,359,Please make Father say yes!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,360,"- Sansa... - Please, please!"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,361,It's the only thing I ever wanted.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,362,"Fill that up! Boys, Rodrik, come on."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,363,Come on!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,364,"Come here, you little beauty!"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,365,Is he dead yet?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,366,Uncle Benjen.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,367,You got bigger.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,368,Rode all day.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,369,Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,370,Why aren't you at the feast?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,371,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,372,to seat a bastard in their midst.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,373,"Well, you're always welcome on the Wall."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,374,No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,375,So take me with you when you go back.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,376,- Jon... - Father will let me if you ask him.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,377,I know he will.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,378,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,379,I'm ready to swear your oath.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,380,You don't understand what you'd be giving up.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,381,We have no families.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,382,- None of us will ever father sons. - I don't care about that.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,383,"You might, if you knew what it meant."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,384,"I'd better get inside,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,385,rescue your father from his guests.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,386,We'll talk later.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,387,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,388,What are you doing back there?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,389,Preparing for a night with your family.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,390,I've always wanted to see the Wall.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,391,"You're Tyrion Lannister,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,392,the queen's brother?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,393,My greatest accomplishment.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,394,"And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,395,Did I offend you? Sorry.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,396,"You are the bastard, though."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,397,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,398,"And Lady Stark is not your mother,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,399,making you... the bastard.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,400,"Let me give you some advice, bastard."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,401,Never forget what you are.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,402,The rest of the world will not.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,403,Wear it like armour...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,404,and it can never be used to hurt you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,405,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,406,All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,407,You at a feast...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,408,it's like a bear in a trap.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,409,The boy I beheaded...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,410,- did you know him? - Of course I did. Just a lad.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,411,"But he was tough, Ned,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,412,a true ranger.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,413,He was talking madness.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,414,Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,415,The two he was with are still missing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,416,Hmph. A wildling ambush.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,417,Maybe.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,418,"Direwolves south of the Wall,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,419,"talk of the walkers,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,420,and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,421,Winter is coming.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,422,Winter is coming.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,423,- Uncle Benjen. - Robb boy.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,424,- How are you? - I'm good.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,425,"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,426,Yes. Lovely country.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,427,I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,428,I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,429,"Hello, little dove."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,430,But you are a beauty.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,431,"- How old are you? - Thirteen, Your Grace."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,432,You're tall. Still growing?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,433,"I think so, Your Grace."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,434,And have you bled yet?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,435,"No, Your Grace."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,436,"Your dress, did you make it?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,437,Such talent. You must make something for me.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,438,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,439,I hear the same.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,440,Your daughter will do well in the capital.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,441,Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,442,- Your pardon. - I hear we might be neighbours soon.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,443,"- I hope it's true. - Yes, the king has honoured me with his offer."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,444,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,445,It would be good to have you on the field.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,446,The competition has become a bit stale.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,447,- I don't fight in tournaments. - No?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,448,Getting a little old for it?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,449,I don't fight in tournaments
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,450,"because when I fight a man for real,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,451,I don't want him to know what I can do.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,452,Well said.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,453,Arya!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,454,It's not funny!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,455,She always does this.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,456,This was my favourite dress and she ruined it.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,457,She always does it and it's not funny!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,458,Time for bed.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,459,I'm a Northman.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,460,"I belong here with you, not down south in that rats' nest they call a capital."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,461,I won't let him take you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,462,The king takes what he wants.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,463,That's why he's king.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,464,"I'll say, ""Listen, fat man."""
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,465,"""You are not taking my husband anywhere."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,466,"""He belongs to me now."""
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,467,How did he get so fat?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,468,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,469,"It's Maester Luwin, my lord."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,470,Send him in.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,471,"Pardon, my lord, my lady."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,472,A rider in the night...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,473,from your sister.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,474,- Stay. - This was sent from the Eyrie.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,475,What's she doing at the Eyrie?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,476,She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,477,What news?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,478,She's fled the capital.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,479,She says Jon Arryn was murdered.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,480,By the Lannisters.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,481,She says the king is in danger.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,482,"She's fresh widowed, Cat."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,483,She doesn't know what she's saying.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,484,Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,485,"Do you think she would risk her life,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,486,"her son's life,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,487,if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,488,If this news is true...
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,489,"and the Lannisters conspire against the throne,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,490,who but you can protect the king?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,491,They murdered the last Hand.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,492,Now you want Ned to take the job?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,493,The king rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark's help.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,494,He's the only one he trusts.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,495,"You swore the king an oath, my lord."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,496,He's spent half his life fighting Robert's wars.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,497,He owes him nothing.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,498,Your father and brother rode south once
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,499,on a king's demand.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,500,A different time.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,501,A different king.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,502,When do I meet with the khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,503,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,504,- When? - When their omens favour war.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,505,I piss on Dothraki omens.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,506,I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,507,Etayo akka.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,508,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,509,"Jadi, zhey Jorah andahli!"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,510,Khal vezhven.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,511,"A small gift, for the new khaleesi."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,512,Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,513,"Thank you, ser."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,514,Are you from my country?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,515,Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,516,I served your father for many years.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,517,"Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,518,"Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,519,from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,520,"The ages have turned them to stone,"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,521,but they will always be beautiful.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,522,"Thank you, Magister."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,523,She's beautiful.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,524,"Ser Jorah, I..."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,525,"I don't know how to say ""thank you"" in Dothraki."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,526,"There is no word for ""thank you"" in Dothraki."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,527,Make him happy.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,528,No.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,529,Do you know the common tongue?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,530,No.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,531,"Is ""no"" the only word that you know?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,532,No.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,533,"Rough night, Imp?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,534,If I get through this without squirting
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,535,"from one end or the other, it'll be a miracle."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,536,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,537,The greatest in the land - my spear never misses.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,538,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,539,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,540,"No, but I'm still better than you."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,541,I know what I'm putting you through.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,542,Thank you for saying yes.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,543,I only ask you because I need you.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,544,You're a loyal friend. You hear me?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,545,A loyal friend.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,546,The last one I've got.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,547,- I hope I'll serve you well. - You will.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,548,And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,549,"Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,550,"Come on, you."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,551,Stop! Stop.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,552,Are you completely mad?
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,553,"- He saw us. - It's all right, it's all right."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,554,- It's all right. - He saw us!
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,555,I heard you the first time.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,556,"Quite the little climber, aren't you?"
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,557,"- How old are you, boy? - Ten."
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,558,Ten.
S01E01,Winter Is Coming,559,The things I do for love.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,1,"You need to drink, child."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,2,And eat.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,3,Isn't there anything else?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,4,The Dothraki have two things in abundance - grass and horses.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,5,People can't live on grass.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,6,"In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,7,they say there are fields of ghost grass
S01E02,The Kingsroad,8,with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,9,It murders all other grass.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,10,The Dothraki believe that one day
S01E02,The Kingsroad,11,it will cover everything - that's the way the world will end.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,12,It'll get easier.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,13,Khaleesi!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,14,Your hands.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,15,"We're still not far from Pentos, Your Grace."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,16,Master Illyrio has extended his hospitality.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,17,You'd be more comfortable there.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,18,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,19,I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,20,"As you wish, Your Grace."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,21,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,22,I suppose it is preferable to beheading.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,23,What did Ned Stark want you for?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,24,Buying from a slaver?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,25,Selling to one.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,26,Some poachers I caught on my land.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,27,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,28,You can rest assured of that.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,29,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,30,My mother's been looking for you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,31,We ride for King's Landing today.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,32,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,33,and offer your sympathies.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,34,What good will my sympathies do them?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,35,None. But it is expected of you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,36,Your absence has already been noted.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,37,The boy means nothing to me.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,38,And I can't stand the wailing of women.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,39,One word and I'll hit you again.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,40,I'm telling Mother!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,41,Go! Tell her.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,42,But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark
S01E02,The Kingsroad,43,and you will fall on your knees in front of them
S01E02,The Kingsroad,44,"and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,45,and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,46,You can't...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,47,Do you understand?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,48,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,49,I hope so.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,50,"If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,51,Ah. Time for breakfast.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,52,Bread. And two of those little fish.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,53,And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,54,"And bacon, burnt black."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,55,Hyah.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,56,- Little brother. - Beloved siblings.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,57,Is Bran going to die?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,58,Apparently not.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,59,- What do you mean? - The maester says the boy may live.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,60,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,61,Only the gods know for certain.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,62,All the rest of us can do is pray.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,63,The charms of the North seem entirely lost on you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,64,I still can't believe you're going.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,65,"It's ridiculous, even for you."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,66,Where's your sense of wonder?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,67,"The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,68,the wintry abode of the white walkers.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,69,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,70,And go celibate? The whores would go begging
S01E02,The Kingsroad,71,from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,72,"No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,73,and piss off the edge of the world.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,74,The children don't need to hear your filth.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,75,Come.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,76,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,77,"Give me a good, clean death any day."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,78,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,79,"Death is so final, whereas life..."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,80,"ah, life is full of possibilities."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,81,I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,82,"My dear brother,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,83,there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,84,"My dear brother, you wound me."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,85,You know how much I love my family.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,86,Please.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,87,"Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,88,This is your home. I'm your guest.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,89,"Handsome one, isn't he?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,90,"I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,91,He was a fighter too -
S01E02,The Kingsroad,92,tried to beat the fever that took him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,93,Forgive me.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,94,It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,95,I never knew.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,96,It was years ago.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,97,"Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,98,all the things men do to show you how much they care.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,99,The boy looked just like him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,100,Such a little thing.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,101,A bird without feathers.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,102,They came to take his body away
S01E02,The Kingsroad,103,"and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,104,That little bundle.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,105,They took him away and I never saw him again.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,106,"Never have visited the crypt, never."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,107,I pray to the Mother every morning and night
S01E02,The Kingsroad,108,that she return your child to you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,109,I am grateful.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,110,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,111,A sword for the Wall?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,112,- I already have one. - Good man.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,113,- Have you swung it yet? - Of course I have.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,114,"At someone, I mean."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,115,"It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,116,"You realise we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,117,and some bone to keep it all standing.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,118,Let me thank you ahead of time
S01E02,The Kingsroad,119,for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall -
S01E02,The Kingsroad,120,wildlings and white walkers and whatnot.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,121,"We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,122,"We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8,000 years."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,123,"Is it ""we"" already?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,124,"Have you taken your vows, then?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,125,Soon enough.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,126,Give my regards to the Night's Watch.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,127,I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,128,it's only for life.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,129,"Thank you, Nymeria."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,130,Septa Mordane says I have to do it again.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,131,"My things weren't properly folded, she says."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,132,Who cares how they're folded? They're going to get all messed up anyway.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,133,It's good you've got help.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,134,Watch.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,135,"Nymeria, gloves."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,136,- Impressive. - Shut up.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,137,"Nymeria, gloves!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,138,I have something for you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,139,And it has to be packed very carefully.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,140,A present?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,141,Close the door.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,142,This is no toy.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,143,Be careful you don't cut yourself.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,144,- It's so skinny. - So are you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,145,I had the blacksmith make it for you special.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,146,"It won't hack a man's head off,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,147,but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,148,- I can be quick. - You'll have to work at it every day.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,149,How does it feel?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,150,Do you like the balance?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,151,I think so.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,152,First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,153,I know which end to use.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,154,I'm going to miss you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,155,Careful.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,156,"All the best swords have names, you know."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,157,Sansa can keep her sewing needles.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,158,I've got a needle of my own.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,159,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,160,You've said it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,161,I wish I could be here when you wake up.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,162,I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,163,I'm taking the black.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,164,"I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,165,but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,166,I'll know my way around by then.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,167,I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,168,"We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,169,I want you...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,170,to leave.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,171,17 years ago
S01E02,The Kingsroad,172,you rode off with Robert Baratheon.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,173,You came back a year later with another woman's son.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,174,And now you're leaving again.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,175,I have no choice.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,176,That's what men always say when honour calls.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,177,"That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,178,You do have a choice.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,179,And you've made it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,180,Cat...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,181,"I can't do it, Ned."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,182,I really can't.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,183,You can.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,184,You must.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,185,You've said goodbye to Bran?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,186,He's not going to die. I know it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,187,You Starks are hard to kill.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,188,My mother?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,189,- She was very kind. - Good.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,190,"Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,191,It was always my colour.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,192,"Farewell, Snow."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,193,"And you, Stark."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,194,There's great honour serving in the Night's Watch.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,195,The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,196,And you are a Stark.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,197,"You might not have my name,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,198,but you have my blood.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,199,Is my mother alive?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,200,"Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,201,Does she care?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,202,"The next time we see each other,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,203,we'll talk about your mother.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,204,Hmm?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,205,I promise.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,206,"Gods, this is country!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,207,I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,208,I've half a mind to go with you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,209,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,210,a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,211,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,212,"There were wars to fight, women to marry -"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,213,we never had the chance to be young.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,214,I recall a few chances.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,215,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,216,That common girl of yours?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,217,Becca. With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,218,Bessie. She was one of yours.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,219,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,220,And her tits.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,221,"Yours was, er... Aleena?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,222,No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,223,Your bastard's mother?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,224,- Wylla. - That's it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,225,She must have been a rare wench
S01E02,The Kingsroad,226,to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honour.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,227,You never told me what she looked like.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,228,Nor will I.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,229,We were at war.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,230,None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,231,You're too hard on yourself. You always have been.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,232,"I swear if I weren't your king, you'd have hit me already."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,233,The worst thing about your coronation -
S01E02,The Kingsroad,234,I'll never get to hit you again.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,235,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,236,There was a rider in the night.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,237,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,238,What of it? Do we send her a wedding gift?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,239,"A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,240,and a bold man to wield it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,241,She's little more than a child.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,242,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,243,"- Tell me we're not speaking of this. - Oh, it's unspeakable to you?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,244,What her father did to your family - that was unspeakable.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,245,What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister -
S01E02,The Kingsroad,246,the woman I loved.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,247,I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,248,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,249,"This Khal Drogo,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,250,"it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,251,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,252,as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,253,"They have no ships, Robert."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,254,There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,255,"If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,256,- the scum will join him. - He will not cross.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,257,"And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,258,"There's a war coming, Ned."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,259,"I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,260,but it's coming.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,261,Sit.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,262,You'll be fed.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,263,Untie them.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,264,"Ah, rapers."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,265,"They were given a choice, no doubt - castration or the Wall."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,266,Most choose the knife.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,267,Not impressed by your new brothers?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,268,Lovely thing about the Watch -
S01E02,The Kingsroad,269,you discard your old family and get a whole new one.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,270,Why do you read so much?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,271,Look at me and tell me what you see.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,272,Is this a trick?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,273,What you see is a dwarf.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,274,If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,275,"Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,276,Things are expected of me.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,277,My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,278,Until your brother killed that king.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,279,"Yes, until my brother killed him."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,280,Life is full of these little ironies.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,281,"My sister married the new king, and..."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,282,my repulsive nephew will be king after him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,283,I must do my part for the honour of my house. Wouldn't you agree?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,284,But how?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,285,"Well, my brother has his sword"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,286,"and I have my mind,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,287,and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,288,"That's why I read so much, Jon Snow."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,289,And you?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,290,"What's your story, bastard?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,291,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,292,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,293,"off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,294,alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,295,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,296,"Ah, yes, yes, against grumpkins and snarks"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,297,and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,298,You're a smart boy.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,299,You don't believe that nonsense.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,300,Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,301,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,302,You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,303,Talk to Poole about it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,304,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,305,"We need a new steward,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,306,and there are several other appointments that require
S01E02,The Kingsroad,307,- our immediate attention. - I don't care about appointments!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,308,I'll make the appointments.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,309,We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,310,"Very good, my lord."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,311,My lady.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,312,When was the last time you left this room?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,313,I have to take care of him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,314,"He's not going to die, Mother."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,315,Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,316,What if he's wrong?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,317,- Bran needs me. - Rickon needs you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,318,He's six.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,319,"He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,320,"- clutching my leg, crying... - Close the windows!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,321,I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,322,Fire.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,323,You stay here. I'll come back.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,324,You're not supposed to be here.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,325,No one is supposed to be here.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,326,It's a mercy.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,327,He's dead already.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,328,No!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,329,"- Have you ever seen a dragon? - Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,330,Everywhere? Even in the East?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,331,No dragon. Brave men kill them.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,332,- It is known. - It is known.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,333,A trader from Qarth told me that dragons come from the moon.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,334,The moon?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,335,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,336,that once there were two moons in the sky.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,337,"But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,338,and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons
S01E02,The Kingsroad,339,and they drank the sun's fire.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,340,Moon is no egg.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,341,Moon is goddess - wife of sun.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,342,- It is known. - It is known.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,343,Leave me with her.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,344,Why did the trader from Qarth tell you these stories?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,345,Men like to talk when they're happy.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,346,"Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,347,How old were you?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,348,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,349,Nine?!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,350,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,351,First you must learn.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,352,Can you teach me how to make the khal happy?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,353,Yes.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,354,Will it take three years?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,355,No.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,356,Welcome.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,357,What I am about to tell you must remain between us.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,358,I don't think Bran fell from that tower.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,359,I think he was thrown.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,360,The boy was always surefooted before.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,361,Someone tried to kill him twice.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,362,Why? Why murder an innocent child?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,363,Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,364,"- Saw what, my lady? - I don't know."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,365,But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,366,We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the Crown.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,367,Did you notice the dagger the killer used?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,368,It's too fine a weapon for such a man.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,369,"The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,370,Someone gave it to him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,371,They come into our home and try to murder my brother?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,372,If it's war they want...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,373,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,374,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,375,Hmm?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,376,Too easily words of war become acts of war.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,377,We don't know the truth yet.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,378,Lord Stark must be told of this.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,379,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,380,- I'll ride to King's Landing. - No.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,381,There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,382,"- I will go myself. - Mother, you can't."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,383,I must.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,384,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,385,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,386,I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,387,Let me accompany you at least.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,388,The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,389,What about Bran?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,390,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,391,Bran's life is in their hands now.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,392,"No, Khaleesi."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,393,You must look in his eyes always.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,394,Love comes in at the eyes.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,395,It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man
S01E02,The Kingsroad,396,with nothing but her eyes.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,397,Finish a man?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,398,Oh.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,399,Kings travelled across the world for a night with Irogenia.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,400,Magisters sold their palaces.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,401,Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,402,They say a thousand men proposed to her
S01E02,The Kingsroad,403,and she refused them all.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,404,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,405,I... I don't think
S01E02,The Kingsroad,406,that Drogo will like it with me on top.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,407,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,408,Men want what they've never had.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,409,And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,410,"Are you a slave, Khaleesi?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,411,Then don't make love like a slave.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,412,"Very good, Khaleesi."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,413,"Out there he is the mighty khal,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,414,"but in this tent, he belongs to you."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,415,I... I don't think
S01E02,The Kingsroad,416,that this is the Dothraki way.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,417,"If he wanted the Dothraki way,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,418,why did he marry you?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,419,No.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,420,No!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,421,Tonight I would look upon your face!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,422,"Pardon me, ser."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,423,"Do I frighten you so much, girl?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,424,Or is it him there making you shake?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,425,He frightens me too.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,426,Look at that face.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,427,"I'm sorry if I offended you, ser."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,428,Why won't he speak to me?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,429,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,430,Since the Mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,431,He speaks damn well with his sword though.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,432,"Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,433,The Royal Executioner.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,434,"What is it, sweet lady?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,435,Does the hound frighten you?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,436,"Away with you, dog."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,437,You're scaring my lady.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,438,I don't like to see you upset.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,439,The sun's finally shining.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,440,Come walk with me.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,441,"Stay, Lady."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,442,I probably shouldn't have any more.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,443,Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,444,My princess can drink as much as she wants.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,445,Don't worry. You're safe with me.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,446,I'll get you!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,447,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,448,Ow!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,449,What are you doing here?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,450,- Go away. - Your sister?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,451,"- And who are you, boy? - Mycah, my lord."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,452,- He's the butcher's boy. - He's my friend.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,453,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a knight, eh?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,454,"Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,455,"She asked me to, my lord. She asked me to."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,456,"I'm your prince, not your lord,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,457,and I said pick up your sword.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,458,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,459,And you're not a knight.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,460,Only a butcher's boy.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,461,That was my lady's sister you were hitting. Do you know that?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,462,"- Stop it! - Arya, stay out of this."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,463,I won't hurt him...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,464,much.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,465,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,466,Filthy little bitch!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,467,"No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,468,You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,469,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,470,- Arya! - Nymeria!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,471,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,472,Nymeria!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,473,No.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,474,No. Please don't.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,475,"Arya, leave him alone."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,476,"My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,477,Stay here. I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,478,Then go!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,479,Don't touch me.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,480,The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,481,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,482,Go on. Run.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,483,Go! Leave now!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,484,- It's a direwolf. - I'll check down here.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,485,I think I heard a noise.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,486,Go!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,487,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,488,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,489,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,490,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,491,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,492,Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,493,My lord!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,494,My Lord! They've found her.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,495,- She's unharmed. -  Arya!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,496,- Where is she? - She's been taken directly before the king.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,497,- Who took her? - The Lannisters found her.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,498,"- Arya! - Right, get back."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,499,The queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,500,Back! Back to the inn!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,501,All back!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,502,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,503,- Are you hurt? - No.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,504,"Oh, it's all right."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,505,What is the meaning of this?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,506,Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,507,How dare you speak to your king in that manner?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,508,"Quiet, woman."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,509,"Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,510,But we need to get this business done quickly.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,511,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,512,That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,513,That's not true!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,514,She just... bit him a little.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,515,- He was hurting Mycah. - Joff told us what happened.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,516,You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,517,That's not what happened!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,518,"Yes, it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,519,- Liar! - Shut up!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,520,Enough!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,521,"He tells me one thing, she tells me another."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,522,Seven hells! What am I to make of this?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,523,"- Where's your other daughter, Ned? - In bed, asleep."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,524,She's not.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,525,"Sansa, come here, darling."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,526,"Now, child..."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,527,tell me what happened.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,528,Tell it all and tell it true.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,529,It's a great crime to lie to a king.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,530,I don't know.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,531,I don't remember. Everything happened so fast.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,532,- I didn't see. - Liar!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,533,"- Liar, liar, liar! - Arya!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,534,"- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. - Liar, liar, liar!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,535,- Stop! Arya! - She's as wild as that animal of hers.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,536,"- I want her punished. - What would you have me do,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,537,whip her through the streets?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,538,"Damn it, children fight. It's over."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,539,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,540,You let that little girl disarm you?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,541,"Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,542,"- I'll do the same with my son. - Gladly, Your Grace."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,543,And what of the direwolf?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,544,What of the beast that savaged your son?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,545,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,546,"We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,547,No? So be it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,548,We have another wolf.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,549,As you will.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,550,- You can't mean it. - A direwolf's no pet.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,551,Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,552,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he?"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,553,"No, no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,554,- She's good! - Lady wasn't there!
S01E02,The Kingsroad,555,- You leave her alone! - Stop them. Don't let them do it.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,556,"Please, please, it wasn't Lady!"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,557,Is this your command?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,558,Your Grace?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,559,"- Where is the beast? - Chained up outside, Your Grace."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,560,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honour."
S01E02,The Kingsroad,561,No.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,562,Jory...
S01E02,The Kingsroad,563,take the girls to their rooms.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,564,"If it must be done,"
S01E02,The Kingsroad,565,then I'll do it myself.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,566,Is this some trick?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,567,The wolf is of the North.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,568,She deserves better than a butcher.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,569,The butcher's boy - you rode him down?
S01E02,The Kingsroad,570,He ran.
S01E02,The Kingsroad,571,Not very fast.
S01E03,Lord Snow,1,"Welcome, Lord Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,2,Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council.
S01E03,Lord Snow,3,The honour of your presence is requested.
S01E03,Lord Snow,4,Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper.
S01E03,Lord Snow,5,"- And, Jory, you go with them. - Yes, my lord."
S01E03,Lord Snow,6,If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...
S01E03,Lord Snow,7,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,8,About time we had some stern northern leadership.
S01E03,Lord Snow,9,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
S01E03,Lord Snow,10,Sturdy old thing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,11,"How many kings' arses have polished it, I wonder?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,12,"Um, what's the line?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,13,The king shits and the Hand wipes.
S01E03,Lord Snow,14,Very handsome armour.
S01E03,Lord Snow,15,- Not a scratch on it. - I know.
S01E03,Lord Snow,16,"People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
S01E03,Lord Snow,17,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
S01E03,Lord Snow,18,I have a knack for it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,19,"It must be strange for you, coming into this room."
S01E03,Lord Snow,20,I was standing right here when it happened.
S01E03,Lord Snow,21,"He was very brave, your brother."
S01E03,Lord Snow,22,"Your father, too."
S01E03,Lord Snow,23,They didn't deserve to die like that.
S01E03,Lord Snow,24,Nobody deserves to die like that.
S01E03,Lord Snow,25,But you just stood there and watched.
S01E03,Lord Snow,26,500 men just stood there and watched.
S01E03,Lord Snow,27,All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E03,Lord Snow,28,"You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,29,"No, Lord Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,30,500 men and this room was silent as a crypt.
S01E03,Lord Snow,31,"Except for the screams, of course,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,32,and the Mad King laughing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,33,And later...
S01E03,Lord Snow,34,"when I watched the Mad King die,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,35,I remembered him laughing as your father burned...
S01E03,Lord Snow,36,It felt like justice.
S01E03,Lord Snow,37,Is that what you tell yourself at night?
S01E03,Lord Snow,38,You're a servant of justice?
S01E03,Lord Snow,39,That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
S01E03,Lord Snow,40,"Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,41,would you admire me more?
S01E03,Lord Snow,42,You served him well... when serving was safe.
S01E03,Lord Snow,43,Lord Stark.
S01E03,Lord Snow,44,Lord Varys.
S01E03,Lord Snow,45,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.
S01E03,Lord Snow,46,We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
S01E03,Lord Snow,47,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son.
S01E03,Lord Snow,48,Renly! You're looking well.
S01E03,Lord Snow,49,And you look tired from the road.
S01E03,Lord Snow,50,"I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,51,But we have a kingdom to look after.
S01E03,Lord Snow,52,"I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,53,"- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me. - She has, Lord Baelish."
S01E03,Lord Snow,54,I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
S01E03,Lord Snow,55,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem...
S01E03,Lord Snow,56,from navel to collarbone.
S01E03,Lord Snow,57,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
S01E03,Lord Snow,58,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord."
S01E03,Lord Snow,59,It was Catelyn Tully.
S01E03,Lord Snow,60,"A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
S01E03,Lord Snow,61,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,62,Grand Maester.
S01E03,Lord Snow,63,How many years has it been?
S01E03,Lord Snow,64,- You were a young man. - And you served another king.
S01E03,Lord Snow,65,"Oh, how forgetful of me."
S01E03,Lord Snow,66,This belongs to you now.
S01E03,Lord Snow,67,Should we begin?
S01E03,Lord Snow,68,"- Without the king? - Winter may be coming,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,69,but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
S01E03,Lord Snow,70,His Grace has many cares.
S01E03,Lord Snow,71,He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
S01E03,Lord Snow,72,We are the lords of small matters here.
S01E03,Lord Snow,73,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament
S01E03,Lord Snow,74,in honour of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
S01E03,Lord Snow,75,"- Mm, how much? - 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,76,"20,000 to the runner-up,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,77,"20,000 to the winning archer."
S01E03,Lord Snow,78,Can the treasury bear such expense?
S01E03,Lord Snow,79,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect."
S01E03,Lord Snow,80,"We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold. What's another 80,000?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,81,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
S01E03,Lord Snow,82,- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt. - How could you let this happen?
S01E03,Lord Snow,83,The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,84,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
S01E03,Lord Snow,85,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,86,but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
S01E03,Lord Snow,87,"""Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
S01E03,Lord Snow,88,I'll speak to him tomorrow.
S01E03,Lord Snow,89,This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
S01E03,Lord Snow,90,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
S01E03,Lord Snow,91,There will be no plans... until I speak to Robert.
S01E03,Lord Snow,92,"Forgive me, my lords. I'm..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,93,"- I had a long ride. - You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,94,We serve at your pleasure.
S01E03,Lord Snow,95,"- Ow! - Please, it's nearly healed."
S01E03,Lord Snow,96,- It's ugly. - A king should have scars.
S01E03,Lord Snow,97,You fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
S01E03,Lord Snow,98,I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream.
S01E03,Lord Snow,99,"And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
S01E03,Lord Snow,100,That's not true. You killed the beast.
S01E03,Lord Snow,101,You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father.
S01E03,Lord Snow,102,"I didn't, I..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,103,"When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor."
S01E03,Lord Snow,104,Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,105,Do I have to marry her?
S01E03,Lord Snow,106,Yes.
S01E03,Lord Snow,107,She's very beautiful and young.
S01E03,Lord Snow,108,"If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions"
S01E03,Lord Snow,109,"and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses."
S01E03,Lord Snow,110,"And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores."
S01E03,Lord Snow,111,"And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it."
S01E03,Lord Snow,112,You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.
S01E03,Lord Snow,113,Do something nice for the Stark girl.
S01E03,Lord Snow,114,"- I don't want to. - No, but you will."
S01E03,Lord Snow,115,The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
S01E03,Lord Snow,116,We allow the northerners too much power.
S01E03,Lord Snow,117,They consider themselves our equals.
S01E03,Lord Snow,118,How would you handle them?
S01E03,Lord Snow,119,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
S01E03,Lord Snow,120,A royal army?
S01E03,Lord Snow,121,Why should every lord command his own men?
S01E03,Lord Snow,122,"It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes."
S01E03,Lord Snow,123,"We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,124,"trained by experienced soldiers,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,125,instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
S01E03,Lord Snow,126,And if the northerners rebel?
S01E03,Lord Snow,127,I'd crush them.
S01E03,Lord Snow,128,Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North.
S01E03,Lord Snow,129,"Uncle Kevan, maybe."
S01E03,Lord Snow,130,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,131,- For me. I'm their king. - Mm-hm.
S01E03,Lord Snow,132,"But you've just invaded their homeland,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,133,- asked them to kill their brothers. - I'm not asking.
S01E03,Lord Snow,134,"The North cannot be held, not by an outsider."
S01E03,Lord Snow,135,It's too big and too wild.
S01E03,Lord Snow,136,"And when the winter comes, the seven gods together"
S01E03,Lord Snow,137,couldn't save you and your royal army.
S01E03,Lord Snow,138,A good king knows when to save his strength...
S01E03,Lord Snow,139,and when to destroy his enemies.
S01E03,Lord Snow,140,So you agree...
S01E03,Lord Snow,141,the Starks are enemies?
S01E03,Lord Snow,142,Everyone who isn't us... is an enemy.
S01E03,Lord Snow,143,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
S01E03,Lord Snow,144,- I'm practicing. - Practicing for what?
S01E03,Lord Snow,145,"- The prince. - Arya, stop!"
S01E03,Lord Snow,146,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
S01E03,Lord Snow,147,The Hound killed your friend.
S01E03,Lord Snow,148,The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do.
S01E03,Lord Snow,149,"- You're an idiot. - You're a liar, and if you told the truth,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,150,Mycah would be alive.
S01E03,Lord Snow,151,Enough!
S01E03,Lord Snow,152,What's happening here?
S01E03,Lord Snow,153,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
S01E03,Lord Snow,154,Go to your room. We'll speak later.
S01E03,Lord Snow,155,"That's for you, love."
S01E03,Lord Snow,156,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.
S01E03,Lord Snow,157,Don't you like it?
S01E03,Lord Snow,158,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.
S01E03,Lord Snow,159,- May I be excused? - You've barely eaten a thing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,160,It's all right. Go on.
S01E03,Lord Snow,161,War was easier than daughters.
S01E03,Lord Snow,162,Go away!
S01E03,Lord Snow,163,"Arya, open the door."
S01E03,Lord Snow,164,May I come in?
S01E03,Lord Snow,165,- Whose sword is that? - Mine.
S01E03,Lord Snow,166,Give it to me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,167,I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work.
S01E03,Lord Snow,168,Where did you get this?
S01E03,Lord Snow,169,This is no toy.
S01E03,Lord Snow,170,- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords. - I wasn't playing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,171,And I don't want to be a lady.
S01E03,Lord Snow,172,Come here.
S01E03,Lord Snow,173,Now what do you want with this?
S01E03,Lord Snow,174,It's called Needle.
S01E03,Lord Snow,175,"Oh, a blade with a name."
S01E03,Lord Snow,176,And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle?
S01E03,Lord Snow,177,Your sister?
S01E03,Lord Snow,178,Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
S01E03,Lord Snow,179,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
S01E03,Lord Snow,180,That's the essence of it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,181,I was trying to learn.
S01E03,Lord Snow,182,I asked Mycah to practice with me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,183,I asked him. It was my fault.
S01E03,Lord Snow,184,"No, sweet girl. No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy."
S01E03,Lord Snow,185,I hate them. I hate all of them.
S01E03,Lord Snow,186,"The Hound, the queen and the king"
S01E03,Lord Snow,187,and Joffrey and Sansa.
S01E03,Lord Snow,188,Sansa was dragged before the king and queen...
S01E03,Lord Snow,189,and asked to call the prince a liar.
S01E03,Lord Snow,190,So was I! He is a liar.
S01E03,Lord Snow,191,"Shh, darling, listen to me."
S01E03,Lord Snow,192,Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday.
S01E03,Lord Snow,193,She cannot betray him.
S01E03,Lord Snow,194,She must take his side even when he's wrong.
S01E03,Lord Snow,195,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
S01E03,Lord Snow,196,Well...
S01E03,Lord Snow,197,Look at me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,198,You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
S01E03,Lord Snow,199,Winter is coming.
S01E03,Lord Snow,200,You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else.
S01E03,Lord Snow,201,But now winter is truly coming.
S01E03,Lord Snow,202,"And in the winter, we must protect ourselves,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,203,look after one another.
S01E03,Lord Snow,204,Sansa is your sister.
S01E03,Lord Snow,205,I don't hate her.
S01E03,Lord Snow,206,Not really.
S01E03,Lord Snow,207,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either."
S01E03,Lord Snow,208,We've come to a dangerous place.
S01E03,Lord Snow,209,We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.
S01E03,Lord Snow,210,All right?
S01E03,Lord Snow,211,Go on. It's yours.
S01E03,Lord Snow,212,I can keep it?
S01E03,Lord Snow,213,Try not to stab your sister with it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,214,"If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
S01E03,Lord Snow,215,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.
S01E03,Lord Snow,216,- I know a story about a crow. - I hate your stories.
S01E03,Lord Snow,217,I know a story about a boy who hated stories.
S01E03,Lord Snow,218,I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.
S01E03,Lord Snow,219,Those were always your favourites.
S01E03,Lord Snow,220,Those weren't my favourites.
S01E03,Lord Snow,221,My favourites were the scary ones.
S01E03,Lord Snow,222,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,223,"Fear is for the winter,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,224,when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.
S01E03,Lord Snow,225,"Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years"
S01E03,Lord Snow,226,"and children are born and live and die, all in darkness."
S01E03,Lord Snow,227,"That is the time for fear, my little lord,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,228,when the white walkers move through the woods.
S01E03,Lord Snow,229,Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation.
S01E03,Lord Snow,230,"Kings froze to death in their castles,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,231,same as the shepherds in their huts.
S01E03,Lord Snow,232,"And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,233,and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.
S01E03,Lord Snow,234,So is this the sort of story that you like?
S01E03,Lord Snow,235,"In that darkness, the white walkers came for the first time."
S01E03,Lord Snow,236,"They swept through cities and kingdoms,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,237,"riding their dead horses,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,238,hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...
S01E03,Lord Snow,239,What are you telling him now?
S01E03,Lord Snow,240,Only what the little lord wants to hear.
S01E03,Lord Snow,241,Get your supper. I want some time with him.
S01E03,Lord Snow,242,One time she told me
S01E03,Lord Snow,243,the sky is blue because we live inside the eye
S01E03,Lord Snow,244,of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.
S01E03,Lord Snow,245,Maybe we do.
S01E03,Lord Snow,246,How do you feel?
S01E03,Lord Snow,247,You still don't remember anything?
S01E03,Lord Snow,248,"Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times."
S01E03,Lord Snow,249,"In the wind, in the rain..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,250,A thousand times.
S01E03,Lord Snow,251,- You never fall. - I did though.
S01E03,Lord Snow,252,"It's true, isn't it,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,253,what Maester Luwin says about my legs?
S01E03,Lord Snow,254,I'd rather be dead.
S01E03,Lord Snow,255,- Don't ever say that. - I'd rather be dead.
S01E03,Lord Snow,256,"Fewer eyes back here, my lady."
S01E03,Lord Snow,257,But still too many.
S01E03,Lord Snow,258,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital.
S01E03,Lord Snow,259,"And no one knew who I was the last time I came, either."
S01E03,Lord Snow,260,My lady.
S01E03,Lord Snow,261,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,262,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
S01E03,Lord Snow,263,We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
S01E03,Lord Snow,264,Instructed?
S01E03,Lord Snow,265,"I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,266,"Follow me, Lady Stark."
S01E03,Lord Snow,267,Cat!
S01E03,Lord Snow,268,Go on. Go upstairs.
S01E03,Lord Snow,269,You little worm!
S01E03,Lord Snow,270,You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a...
S01E03,Lord Snow,271,Pssst!
S01E03,Lord Snow,272,"I meant no disrespect, to you of all people."
S01E03,Lord Snow,273,How dare you bring me here? Have you lost your mind?
S01E03,Lord Snow,274,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what you wanted?
S01E03,Lord Snow,275,I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
S01E03,Lord Snow,276,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
S01E03,Lord Snow,277,A dear friend told me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,278,- Lady Stark. - Lord Varys.
S01E03,Lord Snow,279,To see you again after so many years is a blessing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,280,Your poor hands.
S01E03,Lord Snow,281,How did you know I was coming?
S01E03,Lord Snow,282,"Knowledge is my trade, my lady."
S01E03,Lord Snow,283,"Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,284,My little birds are everywhere...
S01E03,Lord Snow,285,even in the North.
S01E03,Lord Snow,286,They whisper to me the strangest stories.
S01E03,Lord Snow,287,Valyrian steel.
S01E03,Lord Snow,288,Do you know whose dagger this is?
S01E03,Lord Snow,289,I must admit I do not.
S01E03,Lord Snow,290,"Well, well, this is an historic day."
S01E03,Lord Snow,291,Something you don't know that I do.
S01E03,Lord Snow,292,There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E03,Lord Snow,293,- It's mine. - Yours?
S01E03,Lord Snow,294,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday."
S01E03,Lord Snow,295,"I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,296,as any sane man would.
S01E03,Lord Snow,297,"When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
S01E03,Lord Snow,298,To whom?
S01E03,Lord Snow,299,Tyrion Lannister.
S01E03,Lord Snow,300,The Imp.
S01E03,Lord Snow,301,"Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of."
S01E03,Lord Snow,302,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead."
S01E03,Lord Snow,303,Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,304,Pyp.
S01E03,Lord Snow,305,Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
S01E03,Lord Snow,306,Next!
S01E03,Lord Snow,307,Next!
S01E03,Lord Snow,308,"Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here."
S01E03,Lord Snow,309,Go clean yourselves up!
S01E03,Lord Snow,310,There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
S01E03,Lord Snow,311,A charming man.
S01E03,Lord Snow,312,I don't need him to be charming.
S01E03,Lord Snow,313,I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways
S01E03,Lord Snow,314,into men of the Night's Watch.
S01E03,Lord Snow,315,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,316,Slowly.
S01E03,Lord Snow,317,A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.
S01E03,Lord Snow,318,Good news or bad?
S01E03,Lord Snow,319,Both.
S01E03,Lord Snow,320,Lord Stark.
S01E03,Lord Snow,321,I meant... to give you this earlier.
S01E03,Lord Snow,322,So forgetful these days.
S01E03,Lord Snow,323,A raven from Winterfell this morning.
S01E03,Lord Snow,324,Good news?
S01E03,Lord Snow,325,Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.
S01E03,Lord Snow,326,- My wife is in Winterfell. - Is she?
S01E03,Lord Snow,327,"Yes, I'm looking at you."
S01E03,Lord Snow,328,I thought that she'd be safest in here.
S01E03,Lord Snow,329,One of several such establishments I own.
S01E03,Lord Snow,330,You're a funny man.
S01E03,Lord Snow,331,Huh? A very funny man.
S01E03,Lord Snow,332,Ned!
S01E03,Lord Snow,333,"Ah, the Starks..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,334,"Quick tempers, slow minds."
S01E03,Lord Snow,335,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
S01E03,Lord Snow,336,It's an improvement.
S01E03,Lord Snow,337,"If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit."
S01E03,Lord Snow,338,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
S01E03,Lord Snow,339,"What are you looking at, halfman?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,340,I'm looking at you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,341,Yes. You've got an interesting face.
S01E03,Lord Snow,342,"Hmm, very distinctive faces."
S01E03,Lord Snow,343,All of you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,344,And what do you care about our faces?
S01E03,Lord Snow,345,It's just...
S01E03,Lord Snow,346,I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King's Landing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,347,"Perhaps I'll write to my sister, the queen, about it."
S01E03,Lord Snow,348,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
S01E03,Lord Snow,349,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,350,No one but you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,351,My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same.
S01E03,Lord Snow,352,Grenn's father left him too...
S01E03,Lord Snow,353,"outside a farmhouse, when he was three."
S01E03,Lord Snow,354,Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.
S01E03,Lord Snow,355,His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.
S01E03,Lord Snow,356,He was given a choice - his right hand or the Wall.
S01E03,Lord Snow,357,I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
S01E03,Lord Snow,358,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
S01E03,Lord Snow,359,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.
S01E03,Lord Snow,360,I don't imagine any of them had ever held a real sword
S01E03,Lord Snow,361,before they came here.
S01E03,Lord Snow,362,Oh...
S01E03,Lord Snow,363,Your brother Bran.
S01E03,Lord Snow,364,He's woken up.
S01E03,Lord Snow,365,The mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy
S01E03,Lord Snow,366,would be considered treason.
S01E03,Lord Snow,367,We have proof. We have the blade.
S01E03,Lord Snow,368,Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.
S01E03,Lord Snow,369,"The only man who could say otherwise has no throat,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,370,thanks to your boy's wolf.
S01E03,Lord Snow,371,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.
S01E03,Lord Snow,372,"He's like a little brother to me, Ned. He would never betray my trust."
S01E03,Lord Snow,373,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake."
S01E03,Lord Snow,374,"A fool's task, admittedly,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,375,but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
S01E03,Lord Snow,376,I won't forget this.
S01E03,Lord Snow,377,You're a true friend.
S01E03,Lord Snow,378,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
S01E03,Lord Snow,379,- How could you be so stupid? - Calm down.
S01E03,Lord Snow,380,He's a child. Ten years old.
S01E03,Lord Snow,381,- What were you thinking? - I was thinking of us.
S01E03,Lord Snow,382,You're a bit late to start complaining about it now.
S01E03,Lord Snow,383,- What has the boy told them? - Nothing. He remembers nothing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,384,Then what are you raving about?
S01E03,Lord Snow,385,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
S01E03,Lord Snow,386,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming.
S01E03,Lord Snow,387,We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.
S01E03,Lord Snow,388,- And my husband? - I'll go to war with him if I have to.
S01E03,Lord Snow,389,They can write a ballad about us -
S01E03,Lord Snow,390,"""The War For Cersei's Cunt."""
S01E03,Lord Snow,391,- Let me go. - Never.
S01E03,Lord Snow,392,- Let me go. - The boy won't talk.
S01E03,Lord Snow,393,"And if he does, I'll kill him."
S01E03,Lord Snow,394,"Him, Ned Stark, the king - the whole bloody lot of them,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,395,until you and I are the only people left in this world.
S01E03,Lord Snow,396,I wish I could see the girls.
S01E03,Lord Snow,397,- It's too dangerous. - Just for a moment.
S01E03,Lord Snow,398,Until we know who our enemies are.
S01E03,Lord Snow,399,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters."
S01E03,Lord Snow,400,"In my bones, I know it."
S01E03,Lord Snow,401,Littlefinger's right.
S01E03,Lord Snow,402,I can't do anything without proof.
S01E03,Lord Snow,403,And if you find the proof?
S01E03,Lord Snow,404,Then I bring it to Robert...
S01E03,Lord Snow,405,and hope he's still the man I once knew.
S01E03,Lord Snow,406,"You watch yourself on the road, huh?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,407,That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,408,My temper?
S01E03,Lord Snow,409,"Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
S01E03,Lord Snow,410,He still loves you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,411,Does he?
S01E03,Lord Snow,412,Off with you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,413,"Yes, it's been a long time."
S01E03,Lord Snow,414,But I still remember every face.
S01E03,Lord Snow,415,You remember your first?
S01E03,Lord Snow,416,"Of course, Your Grace."
S01E03,Lord Snow,417,Who was it?
S01E03,Lord Snow,418,A Tyroshi.
S01E03,Lord Snow,419,- Never learned the name. - Hmm.
S01E03,Lord Snow,420,How did you do it?
S01E03,Lord Snow,421,Lance through the heart.
S01E03,Lord Snow,422,Quick one.
S01E03,Lord Snow,423,Lucky for you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,424,Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.
S01E03,Lord Snow,425,"My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud."
S01E03,Lord Snow,426,"He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,427,thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.
S01E03,Lord Snow,428,I knocked him down with the hammer.
S01E03,Lord Snow,429,"Gods, I was strong then."
S01E03,Lord Snow,430,Caved in his breastplate.
S01E03,Lord Snow,431,Probably shattered every rib he had.
S01E03,Lord Snow,432,"Stood over him, hammer in the air."
S01E03,Lord Snow,433,"Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait."""
S01E03,Lord Snow,434,They never tell you how they all shit themselves.
S01E03,Lord Snow,435,They don't put that part in the songs.
S01E03,Lord Snow,436,Stupid boy.
S01E03,Lord Snow,437,Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.
S01E03,Lord Snow,438,"He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,439,"and today his wife would be making him miserable,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,440,"his sons would be ingrates,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,441,and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.
S01E03,Lord Snow,442,Wine!
S01E03,Lord Snow,443,"Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name."
S01E03,Lord Snow,444,Lancel Lannister.
S01E03,Lord Snow,445,Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter?
S01E03,Lord Snow,446,What are you doing?
S01E03,Lord Snow,447,"- It's empty, Your Grace. - What do you mean, it's empty?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,448,- There's no more wine. - Is that what empty means?!
S01E03,Lord Snow,449,So get more.
S01E03,Lord Snow,450,Tell your cousin to get in here.
S01E03,Lord Snow,451,Kingslayer! Get in here.
S01E03,Lord Snow,452,Surrounded by Lannisters.
S01E03,Lord Snow,453,Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair
S01E03,Lord Snow,454,"and their smug, satisfied faces."
S01E03,Lord Snow,455,"It must wound your pride, huh?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,456,Standing out there like a glorified sentry.
S01E03,Lord Snow,457,"Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,458,forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks.
S01E03,Lord Snow,459,So come on.
S01E03,Lord Snow,460,We're telling war stories.
S01E03,Lord Snow,461,"Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,462,One of the outlaws in the brotherhood.
S01E03,Lord Snow,463,I was there that day.
S01E03,Lord Snow,464,"You were only a squire, 16 years old."
S01E03,Lord Snow,465,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.
S01E03,Lord Snow,466,Best move I ever saw.
S01E03,Lord Snow,467,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
S01E03,Lord Snow,468,Your outlaw...
S01E03,Lord Snow,469,any last words?
S01E03,Lord Snow,470,"- I cut his head off, so no. - Hmm."
S01E03,Lord Snow,471,What about Aerys Targaryen?
S01E03,Lord Snow,472,What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back?
S01E03,Lord Snow,473,I never asked.
S01E03,Lord Snow,474,Did he call you a traitor?
S01E03,Lord Snow,475,Did he plead for a reprieve?
S01E03,Lord Snow,476,He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours...
S01E03,Lord Snow,477,"""Burn them all."""
S01E03,Lord Snow,478,"If that's all, Your Grace..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,479,Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?
S01E03,Lord Snow,480,The Dothraki don't believe in money.
S01E03,Lord Snow,481,Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
S01E03,Lord Snow,482,From whom?
S01E03,Lord Snow,483,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices -"
S01E03,Lord Snow,484,pay tribute or fight.
S01E03,Lord Snow,485,An easy choice for most.
S01E03,Lord Snow,486,"Of course, sometimes it's not enough."
S01E03,Lord Snow,487,Sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given.
S01E03,Lord Snow,488,He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly.
S01E03,Lord Snow,489,Sometimes a khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months
S01E03,Lord Snow,490,and need the practice.
S01E03,Lord Snow,491,Tell them all to stop.
S01E03,Lord Snow,492,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
S01E03,Lord Snow,493,Until I command them otherwise.
S01E03,Lord Snow,494,You're learning to talk like a queen.
S01E03,Lord Snow,495,Not a queen.
S01E03,Lord Snow,496,A khaleesi.
S01E03,Lord Snow,497,You dare!
S01E03,Lord Snow,498,You give commands to me? To me?
S01E03,Lord Snow,499,You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E03,Lord Snow,500,I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
S01E03,Lord Snow,501,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
S01E03,Lord Snow,502,No.
S01E03,Lord Snow,503,"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
S01E03,Lord Snow,504,"Please. Please, don't hurt him."
S01E03,Lord Snow,505,Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
S01E03,Lord Snow,506,Huh?
S01E03,Lord Snow,507,Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!
S01E03,Lord Snow,508,I am your king!
S01E03,Lord Snow,509,"Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,510,Uh uh uh uh uh.
S01E03,Lord Snow,511,You... walk.
S01E03,Lord Snow,512,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.
S01E03,Lord Snow,513,- I'm leaving this morning. - You're leaving?
S01E03,Lord Snow,514,I'm the First Ranger.
S01E03,Lord Snow,515,My job is out there.
S01E03,Lord Snow,516,- There have been disturbing reports. - What kind of reports?
S01E03,Lord Snow,517,The kind I don't want to believe.
S01E03,Lord Snow,518,I'm ready. I won't let you down.
S01E03,Lord Snow,519,You're not going.
S01E03,Lord Snow,520,"You're no ranger, Jon."
S01E03,Lord Snow,521,- But I'm better than every... - Better than no one!
S01E03,Lord Snow,522,Here...
S01E03,Lord Snow,523,"a man gets what he earns,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,524,when he earns it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,525,We'll speak when I return.
S01E03,Lord Snow,526,"- A bear's balls. -  Oh, you're joking?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,527,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,528,all fried in his own fat.
S01E03,Lord Snow,529,When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall
S01E03,Lord Snow,530,"and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
S01E03,Lord Snow,531,And how do a bear's balls taste?
S01E03,Lord Snow,532,A bit chewy.
S01E03,Lord Snow,533,"And what about you, my lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,534,Do Dornish girls count?
S01E03,Lord Snow,535,"So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves"
S01E03,Lord Snow,536,and bring them here as eager recruits?
S01E03,Lord Snow,537,Aye.
S01E03,Lord Snow,538,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.
S01E03,Lord Snow,539,Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed.
S01E03,Lord Snow,540,Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
S01E03,Lord Snow,541,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
S01E03,Lord Snow,542,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,543,"Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,544,You don't have enough men to be an army
S01E03,Lord Snow,545,"and, aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
S01E03,Lord Snow,546,I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell
S01E03,Lord Snow,547,when you're back in King's Landing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,548,"It's something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,549,enjoying your brothels.
S01E03,Lord Snow,550,Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall.
S01E03,Lord Snow,551,"Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,552,"might be sickness,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,553,might just be the cold.
S01E03,Lord Snow,554,They die in pain.
S01E03,Lord Snow,555,And they do it...
S01E03,Lord Snow,556,so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
S01E03,Lord Snow,557,Do you think I'm plump?
S01E03,Lord Snow,558,"- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen? - Call me what you like."
S01E03,Lord Snow,559,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,560,I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.
S01E03,Lord Snow,561,I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
S01E03,Lord Snow,562,"You know, my brother once told me..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,563,"that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
S01E03,Lord Snow,564,But...
S01E03,Lord Snow,565,I don't believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers
S01E03,Lord Snow,566,are lurking beyond the Wall.
S01E03,Lord Snow,567,I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings
S01E03,Lord Snow,568,"is that when that wall went up, our ancestors happened"
S01E03,Lord Snow,569,to live on the right side of it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,570,You're right.
S01E03,Lord Snow,571,The wildlings are no different from us.
S01E03,Lord Snow,572,A little rougher maybe.
S01E03,Lord Snow,573,But they're made of meat and bone.
S01E03,Lord Snow,574,I know how to track them and I know how to kill them.
S01E03,Lord Snow,575,It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights.
S01E03,Lord Snow,576,"You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
S01E03,Lord Snow,577,Are you going below?
S01E03,Lord Snow,578,"- Keep well, keep warm. - Enjoy the capital, brother."
S01E03,Lord Snow,579,"Oh, I always do."
S01E03,Lord Snow,580,I think he's starting to like me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,581,"- ""Going below""? - Aye."
S01E03,Lord Snow,582,Into the tunnel and out the other side.
S01E03,Lord Snow,583,He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
S01E03,Lord Snow,584,So... you're heading down to King's Landing too.
S01E03,Lord Snow,585,"Aye, day after tomorrow."
S01E03,Lord Snow,586,I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
S01E03,Lord Snow,587,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
S01E03,Lord Snow,588,"I, er..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,589,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord."
S01E03,Lord Snow,590,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns.
S01E03,Lord Snow,591,No one turns away a Lannister.
S01E03,Lord Snow,592,"Yes, Khaleesi."
S01E03,Lord Snow,593,"Oh, what are you doing?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,594,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,595,"You change, Khaleesi."
S01E03,Lord Snow,596,It's a blessing from the Great Stallion
S01E03,Lord Snow,597,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,598,easier to handle.
S01E03,Lord Snow,599,It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.
S01E03,Lord Snow,600,But a man in full plate...
S01E03,Lord Snow,601,...the arakh won't get through the steel.
S01E03,Lord Snow,602,That's where the broadsword has the advantage.
S01E03,Lord Snow,603,Designed for piercing plate.
S01E03,Lord Snow,604,Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
S01E03,Lord Snow,605,- Armour. -  Armour.
S01E03,Lord Snow,606,"Armour make a man, erm..."
S01E03,Lord Snow,607,Slow.
S01E03,Lord Snow,608,"- Slow. - It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
S01E03,Lord Snow,609,My father taught me how to fight.
S01E03,Lord Snow,610,He taught me that speed defeats size.
S01E03,Lord Snow,611,I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
S01E03,Lord Snow,612,He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.
S01E03,Lord Snow,613,"And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,614,He still is.
S01E03,Lord Snow,615,A man of great honour
S01E03,Lord Snow,616,and I betrayed him.
S01E03,Lord Snow,617,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight.
S01E03,Lord Snow,618,Kill some rabbits.
S01E03,Lord Snow,619,There are no rabbits.
S01E03,Lord Snow,620,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
S01E03,Lord Snow,621,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks."
S01E03,Lord Snow,622,Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
S01E03,Lord Snow,623,Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
S01E03,Lord Snow,624,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
S01E03,Lord Snow,625,The khaleesi have baby inside her.
S01E03,Lord Snow,626,It is true. She does not bleed for two moons.
S01E03,Lord Snow,627,Her belly start to swell.
S01E03,Lord Snow,628,A blessing from the Great Stallion.
S01E03,Lord Snow,629,She does not want to eat horse.
S01E03,Lord Snow,630,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper.
S01E03,Lord Snow,631,I need to ride to Qohor.
S01E03,Lord Snow,632,"Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak."
S01E03,Lord Snow,633,Don't worry. I'll catch you.
S01E03,Lord Snow,634,The horde's easy to find.
S01E03,Lord Snow,635,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target.
S01E03,Lord Snow,636,Except for you. You move too much.
S01E03,Lord Snow,637,I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,638,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
S01E03,Lord Snow,639,"Eight. No, nine."
S01E03,Lord Snow,640,All of them brief?
S01E03,Lord Snow,641,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
S01E03,Lord Snow,642,This summer has lasted nine.
S01E03,Lord Snow,643,But reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter.
S01E03,Lord Snow,644,The Starks are always right eventually -
S01E03,Lord Snow,645,winter is coming.
S01E03,Lord Snow,646,This one will be long...
S01E03,Lord Snow,647,and dark things will come with it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,648,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month."
S01E03,Lord Snow,649,They're fleeing south.
S01E03,Lord Snow,650,The ones who flee... say they've seen the white walkers.
S01E03,Lord Snow,651,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
S01E03,Lord Snow,652,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions.
S01E03,Lord Snow,653,He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
S01E03,Lord Snow,654,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm
S01E03,Lord Snow,655,and what lies beyond.
S01E03,Lord Snow,656,And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men.
S01E03,Lord Snow,657,There are less than a thousand of us now.
S01E03,Lord Snow,658,We can't man the other castles on the Wall.
S01E03,Lord Snow,659,We can't properly patrol the wilderness.
S01E03,Lord Snow,660,We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
S01E03,Lord Snow,661,Your sister sits by the side of the king.
S01E03,Lord Snow,662,Tell her... we need help.
S01E03,Lord Snow,663,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
S01E03,Lord Snow,664,It's a boy.
S01E03,Lord Snow,665,How do you know?
S01E03,Lord Snow,666,I know.
S01E03,Lord Snow,667,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
S01E03,Lord Snow,668,"It's either me or this cold,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,669,and it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
S01E03,Lord Snow,670,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way south?
S01E03,Lord Snow,671,I expect I will.
S01E03,Lord Snow,672,Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
S01E03,Lord Snow,673,"If you see my brother Bran,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,674,tell him I miss him.
S01E03,Lord Snow,675,Tell him I'd visit if I could.
S01E03,Lord Snow,676,Of course.
S01E03,Lord Snow,677,He'll never walk again.
S01E03,Lord Snow,678,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple."
S01E03,Lord Snow,679,"You take care, Snow."
S01E03,Lord Snow,680,"Farewell, my lord."
S01E03,Lord Snow,681,"You are late, boy."
S01E03,Lord Snow,682,Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
S01E03,Lord Snow,683,Who are you?
S01E03,Lord Snow,684,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
S01E03,Lord Snow,685,Tomorrow you will catch it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,686,Now pick it up.
S01E03,Lord Snow,687,"That is not the way, boy."
S01E03,Lord Snow,688,It is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.
S01E03,Lord Snow,689,- It's too heavy. - It is heavy as it needs to be
S01E03,Lord Snow,690,to make you strong.
S01E03,Lord Snow,691,Just so.
S01E03,Lord Snow,692,One hand is all that is needed.
S01E03,Lord Snow,693,Now you are standing all wrong.
S01E03,Lord Snow,694,Turn your body sideface.
S01E03,Lord Snow,695,Yes.
S01E03,Lord Snow,696,So.
S01E03,Lord Snow,697,You are skinny. That is good.
S01E03,Lord Snow,698,The target is smaller.
S01E03,Lord Snow,699,Now the grip - let me see.
S01E03,Lord Snow,700,Yes.
S01E03,Lord Snow,701,The grip must be delicate.
S01E03,Lord Snow,702,What if I drop it?
S01E03,Lord Snow,703,The steel must be part of your arm.
S01E03,Lord Snow,704,Can you drop part of your arm? No.
S01E03,Lord Snow,705,Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
S01E03,Lord Snow,706,"He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
S01E03,Lord Snow,707,I'm a girl.
S01E03,Lord Snow,708,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all."
S01E03,Lord Snow,709,That is the grip.
S01E03,Lord Snow,710,You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
S01E03,Lord Snow,711,A needle.
S01E03,Lord Snow,712,Ahhh.
S01E03,Lord Snow,713,Just so.
S01E03,Lord Snow,714,Now we will begin the dance.
S01E03,Lord Snow,715,"Remember, child,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,716,this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning...
S01E03,Lord Snow,717,"The knight's dance, hacking and hammering."
S01E03,Lord Snow,718,This is the Braavos dance...
S01E03,Lord Snow,719,the water dance.
S01E03,Lord Snow,720,It is swift...
S01E03,Lord Snow,721,and sudden.
S01E03,Lord Snow,722,All men are made of water.
S01E03,Lord Snow,723,Do you know this?
S01E03,Lord Snow,724,"If you pierce them,"
S01E03,Lord Snow,725,the water leaks out and they die.
S01E03,Lord Snow,726,Now you will try to strike me.
S01E03,Lord Snow,727,Ha!
S01E03,Lord Snow,728,Up!
S01E03,Lord Snow,729,Ha!
S01E03,Lord Snow,730,Ah.
S01E03,Lord Snow,731,Dead.
S01E03,Lord Snow,732,Oh!
S01E03,Lord Snow,733,Dead.
S01E03,Lord Snow,734,Hup!
S01E03,Lord Snow,735,Very dead.
S01E03,Lord Snow,736,Come.
S01E03,Lord Snow,737,Ah ah ah!
S01E03,Lord Snow,738,Hup!
S01E03,Lord Snow,739,"Again, faster."
S01E03,Lord Snow,740,Ah.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",1,The little lord's been dreaming again.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",2,- We have visitors. - I don't want to see anyone.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",3,Really? If I was cooped up all day
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",4,"with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",5,"Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",6,- I don't want to go. - Neither do I.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",7,"But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",8,"which means I do what he says, and you do what I say."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",9,Hodor!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",10,- Hodor? - Help Bran down the hall.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",11,Hodor.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",12,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",13,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",14,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",15,"I'm not your boy, Lannister."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",16,I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",17,Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",18,So it's true.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",19,"Hello, Bran."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",20,Do you remember anything about what happened?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",21,He has no memory of that day.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",22,- Curious. - Why are you here?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",23,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",24,"- My neck is beginning to hurt. - Kneel, Hodor."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",25,"- Do you like to ride, Bran? - Yes."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",26,"Well, I mean I did like to."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",27,- The boy has lost the use of his legs. - What of it?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",28,"With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",29,- I'm not a cripple. - Then I'm not a dwarf.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",30,My father will rejoice to hear it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",31,I have a gift for you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",32,Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",33,You must shape the horse to the rider.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",34,Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",35,- Will I really be able to ride? - You will.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",36,On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",37,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",38,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",39,You've done my brother a kindness.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",40,The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",41,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",42,There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",43,Couldn't resist some northern arse?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",44,"If you like Redheads, ask for Ros."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",45,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",46,Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",47,"- He's not my master. - No, of course not."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",48,What happened here? Where is Lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",49,"- She wasn't feeling well. - She's not in Winterfell, is she?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",50,- Where did she go? - M'lady's whereabouts...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",51,M'lady?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",52,Your loyalty to your captors is touching.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",53,"Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",54,if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",55,I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",56,- I believe your uncles were responsible. - Must have been a pretty sight.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",57,Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",58,"Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",59,"- We were outnumbered ten to one. - A stupid rebellion, then."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",60,I suppose your father realised that when your brothers died in battle.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",61,"Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",62,"- Careful, Imp. - I've offended you."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",63,"Forgive me, it's been a rough morning."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",64,"Anyway, don't despair."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",65,I'm a constant disappointment to my own father
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",66,and I've learned to live with it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",67,Your next tumble with Ros is on me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",68,I'll try not to wear her out.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",69,"Shoulder, legs."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",70,"Leg, shoulder, leg."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",71,Left foot forward. Good.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",72,Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",73,What in seven hells is that?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",74,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",75,Tell them your name.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",76,"Samwell Tarly,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",77,"of Horn Hill... I mean, I was of Horn Hill."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",78,I've come to take the black.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",79,Come to take the black pudding.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",80,"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",81,Rast...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",82,see what he can do.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",83,I yield.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",84,"- Please, no more. - On your feet."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",85,Pick up your sword.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",86,Hit him till he finds his feet.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",87,It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",88,- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. - Jon!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",89,"Again, harder."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",90,- I yield! - Enough!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",91,He yielded.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",92,Looks like the bastard's in love.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",93,"All right then, Lord Snow,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",94,"you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",95,You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",96,to make lady piggy squeal.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",97,All you've got to do is get past the bastard.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",98,- Are you sure you want to do this? - No.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",99,"Yield, yield, yield! I yield."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",100,We're done for today. Go clean the armoury.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",101,That's all you're good for.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",102,- Well fought! - Piss off.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",103,- Did he hurt you? - I've had worse.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",104,You can call me Sam... if you want.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",105,"- My mother calls me Sam. - It's not going to get any easier, you know?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",106,- You're going to have to defend yourself. - Why didn't you get up and fight?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",107,I wanted to.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",108,- I just couldn't. - Why not?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",109,I'm a coward.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",110,- My father always says so. - The Wall's no place for cowards.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",111,You're right. I'm sorry.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",112,I just... wanted to thank you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",113,A bloody coward.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",114,People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",115,You're too stupid to be a coward.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",116,"- You're too stupid to be a... - Quick now,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",117,before summer's over.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",118,Come here!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",119,"Hyah, hyah!"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",120,Vaes Dothrak - the city of the horselords.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",121,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",122,- Best these savages can do. - These are my people now.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",123,"- You shouldn't call them savages. - I'll call them what I like,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",124,because they're my people. This is my army.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",125,Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",126,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",127,could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",128,The Dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",129,They fear any water their horses can't drink.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",130,But if they did?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",131,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",132,but the men advising him are different.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",133,"- And you know these men? - I fought beside them once,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",134,long ago.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",135,Now Ned Stark wants my head.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",136,He drove me from my land.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",137,You sold slaves.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",138,Aye.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",139,- Why? - I had no money
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",140,and an expensive wife.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",141,And where is she now?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",142,"In another place,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",143,with another man.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",144,"- Your Grace? - Yes, my dear?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",145,They call you the last dragon...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",146,They do.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",147,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",148,It's entirely possible.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",149,What happened to the dragons?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",150,I was told that brave men killed them all.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",151,The brave men didn't kill dragons.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",152,The brave men rode them.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",153,Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",154,this world has ever seen.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",155,"The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",156,which the Usurper is keeping warm for me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",157,"The swords of the vanquished,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",158,a thousand of them...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",159,melted together like so many candles.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",160,I have always wanted to see a dragon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",161,There's nothing in the world that I would rather see.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",162,Really. Why dragons?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",163,They can fly.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",164,"And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",165,and they're somewhere else...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",166,far away.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",167,And they can kill.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",168,Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",169,gets burned away to nothing...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",170,...melted...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",171,like so many candles.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",172,Ow.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",173,Yes. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",174,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",175,I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",176,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",177,- What have you seen? - I've seen...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",178,a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",179,- Ooh. - I've seen a man who could
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",180,change his face the way that other men change their clothes.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",181,And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",182,and whose ship had sails of coloured silk.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",183,So...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",184,have you seen one?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",185,- A pirate ship? - A dragon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",186,No.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",187,"No, the last one died many years before I was born."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",188,I'll tell you what I have seen -
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",189,their skulls.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",190,They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",191,"When I was very young, just three or four,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",192,my father used to walk me down the rows
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",193,and I'd recite their names for him.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",194,"When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",195,The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",196,and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",197,But... But as you got closer to the Iron Throne...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",198,they got bigger
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",199,and bigger and bigger.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",200,There was Ghiscar
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",201,"and Valryon,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",202,"Vermithrax,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",203,Essovius...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",204,"...Archonei,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",205,"Meraxes,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",206,Vhagar...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",207,and Balerion the Dread...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",208,...whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",209,into one.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",210,What happened to the skulls?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",211,I don't know.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",212,"The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",213,Scattered to the wind.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",214,"- That's very sad. - Yes, it is."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",215,What did I buy you for?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",216,"- To make me sad? - No, Your Grace."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",217,"To, uh, teach your sister."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",218,To teach my sister how to be a better lover?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",219,You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",220,"Oh, you pretty little idiot."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",221,"Go on, then. Get on with it."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",222,Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",223,"And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",224,All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",225,"- What if I have a girl? - Gods be good,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",226,you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",227,What if I only have girls?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",228,I wouldn't worry about that.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",229,Jeyne Poole's mother had five children - all of them girls.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",230,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",231,But what if?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",232,"Well, if you only had girls,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",233,I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",234,And everyone would hate me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",235,Nobody could ever hate you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",236,- Joffrey does. - Nonsense.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",237,Why would you say such a thing?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",238,That business with the wolves? Sansa...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",239,I've told you a hundred times -
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",240,- a direwolf is not... - Please shut up about it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",241,Do you remember your lessons?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",242,- Who built the Iron Throne? - Aegon the Conqueror.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",243,- And who built the Red Keep? - Maegor the Cruel.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",244,And how many years did it take to build...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",245,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",246,"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",247,- The Mad King. - Commonly known as the Mad King.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",248,Why were they killed?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",249,You should speak to your father about these matters.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",250,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",251,"Sansa, you will find it in your heart"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",252,"- to forgive your father. - No, I won't."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",253,"It's the Hand's Tournament that's causing all this trouble, my lords."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",254,The King's Tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",255,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",256,the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",257,"Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",258,three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",259,"- Dreadful. - If you can't keep the king's peace,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",260,perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",261,- I need more men. -  You'll get 50.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",262,- Lord Baelish will see it paid for. - I will?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",263,"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",264,I'll also give you 20 of my household guard
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",265,"- till the crowds have left. - Thank you, my lord Hand, ser."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",266,They will be put to good use.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",267,"The sooner this is over, the better."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",268,"The realm prospers from such events, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",269,"They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",270,And every inn in the city is full
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",271,and the whores are walking bow-legged.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",272,I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",273,- Hmm. - Now...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",274,"if there's nothing else, my lords?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",275,"Oh, this heat."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",276,"On days like this, I envy you northerners,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",277,"your summer snows. Until tomorrow, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",278,I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",279,Lord Arryn?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",280,"Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",281,"I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",282,His sickness struck him very hard and very fast.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",283,I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",284,- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel. - Why?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",285,I have been grand maester for many years.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",286,Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",287,What did Jon want the night before he died?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",288,"Oh, he came inquiring after a book."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",289,A book? What book?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",290,"Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",291,A... A ponderous tome.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",292,"No, I'd like to read it."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",293,The Lineages and Histories
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",294,"of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",295,with descriptions of many high lords
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",296,and noble ladies
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",297,and their children.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",298,"Harkon Umber, first of his name,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",299,born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",300,"in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",301,"at the Last Hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",302,"and fair complected, died in his 14th year"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",303,of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",304,"As I said, my lord, a ponderous read."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",305,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",306,"He did not, my lord. And I did not presume to ask."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",307,- Jon's death... - Such a tragedy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",308,...did he say anything to you during his final hours?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",309,"Nothing of import, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",310,Oh. There was one phrase he kept repeating.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",311,"""The seed is strong,"" I think it was."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",312,"- ""The seed is strong""? - Mmm."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",313,"- What does that mean? - Oh,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",314,"the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",315,"For all the weight they're given,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",316,last words are usually as significant as first words.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",317,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",318,What else could it be?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",319,- Poison. - A disturbing thought.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",320,"No, no, no, I don't think it likely."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",321,The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",322,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",323,"Yes, women, cravens..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",324,and eunuchs.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",325,Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",326,"- Everybody knows that. - Yes, yes, of course."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",327,How that sort of person found himself
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",328,"- on the king's council, I will never know. - I've taken enough of your time."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",329,"No trouble at all, my lord. It's a great honour."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",330,Thank you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",331,I'll find my own way out.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",332,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",333,It's a hard fall down these steps.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",334,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",335,- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. - Cats? Syrio says.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",336,He says every swordsman should study cats.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",337,They're as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",338,- You have to be quick to catch them. - He's right about that.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",339,"Now that Bran's awake, will he come live with us?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",340,"Well, he needs to get his strength back first."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",341,He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",342,"- He can't be one now, can he? - No."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",343,But someday he could be lord of a holdfast
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",344,or sit on the king's council.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",345,Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",346,Can I be lord of a holdfast?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",347,You will marry a high lord and rule his castle.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",348,And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",349,- Hmm? - No.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",350,That's not me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",351,Hello.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",352,Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",353,"I should warn you,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",354,I don't see all that well.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",355,Come stand by the fire.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",356,"- It's warmer. - No, that's all right. I'm fine."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",357,You're not. You're freezing.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",358,I don't like high places.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",359,You can't fight. You can't see.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",360,You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",361,"What are you doing here, Sam?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",362,"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",363,"""You're almost a man now,"" he said."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",364,"""But you're not worthy of my land and title."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",365,"""Tomorrow, you're going to take the black,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",366,"""forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",367,"""If you do not,"" he said,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",368,"""then we'll have a hunt"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",369,"""and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",370,"""and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",371,"""Or so I'll tell your mother."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",372,"""Nothing would please me more."""
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",373,"Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",374,"Yes, he is."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",375,"I'm not going to get any better, you know."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",376,Well...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",377,you can't get any worse.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",378,I hear you're reading a boring book.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",379,Hmph.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",380,"- Pycelle talks too much. - Oh, he never stops."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",381,Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",382,Not surprising.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",383,"Until recently, he was only a squire - Jon Arryn's squire."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",384,He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",385,Knighted for what?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",386,- Why are you telling me this? - I promised Cat that I'd help you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",387,Where is Ser Hugh?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",388,- I'll speak to him. - A singularly bad idea.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",389,Do you see that boy there?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",390,One of Varys's little birds.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",391,The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",392,Now look there.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",393,That one belongs to the queen.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",394,And do you see that septa pretending to read her book?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",395,"- Varys or the queen? - No, she's one of mine."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",396,Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",397,"- Yes. - The wiser answer was no, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",398,Get a message to this paragon of yours - discreetly.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",399,Send him to question Ser Hugh.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",400,"After that, you might want him to visit a certain armourer in the city."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",401,He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",402,"- Why? - I have my observers, as I said,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",403,and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",404,visit this armourer several times in the weeks before his death.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",405,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",406,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",407,"...22, 23,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",408,"24, 5, 6, 27,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",409,"- 28, 29... - Ser Hugh?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",410,"30, 31, 32..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",411,"- Ser Hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",412,"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",413,"- I'm the captain of his guard. - I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",414,"- No ""ser"". I'm not a knight. - I see."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",415,"Well, it just so happens that I am."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",416,He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",417,"- He's a knight, you see. - Ah, a knight."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",418,They strut around like roosters down here.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",419,Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",420,"You shouldn't be out here, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",421,- There's no telling who has eyes where. - Let them look.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",422,"The former Hand did call on me, my lord, several times."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",423,I regret to say he did not honour me with his patronage.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",424,- What did Lord Arryn want? - He always came to see the boy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",425,"- I'd like to see him as well. - As you wish, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",426,Gendry!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",427,Here he is.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",428,Strong for his age. He works hard.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",429,"Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",430,- This is fine work. - It's not for sale.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",431,"Boy, this is the King's Hand!"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",432,- If his lordship wants the helmet... - I made it for me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",433,"- Forgive him, my lord. - There's nothing to forgive."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",434,"When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",435,"He just asked me questions is all, my lord."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",436,What kind of questions?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",437,"About my work at first,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",438,"if I was being treated well, if I liked it here."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",439,But then he started asking me about my mother.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",440,"- Your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",441,What did you tell him?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",442,She died when I was little.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",443,She had yellow hair.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",444,She'd sing to me sometimes.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",445,Look at me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",446,"Get back to work, lad."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",447,"If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",448,you send him to me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",449,Find anything?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",450,King Robert's bastard son.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",451,He likes that.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",452,This is for the king from Lord Stark.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",453,Should I leave it with...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",454,Shhh. Listen.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",455,Do you hear them?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",456,How many do you think are in there with him? Huh?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",457,- Guess. - Three.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",458,Four.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",459,He likes to do this when I'm on duty.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",460,He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",461,"- Forgive me, my lord... - Why do I have to forgive you?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",462,Have you wronged me?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",463,"- We've met before, you know. - Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",464,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",465,Ah.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",466,- That's where you got your scar? - Aye.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",467,- Oh. - One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",468,- Vicious sons of whores. - They like their bloodshed.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",469,They stopped liking it at the end.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",470,That was a proper battle.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",471,Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",472,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",473,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",474,It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",475,- Theon? He's a good lad. - I doubt it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",476,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",477,Let me smell it. Come here.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",478,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",479,I don't serve Lord Stark.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",480,- Where have you been? - Watch duty.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",481,"- With Sam. - Ah, Prince Porkchop."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",482,- Where is he? - He wasn't hungry.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",483,Impossible!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",484,That's enough.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",485,Sam's no different from the rest of us.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",486,"There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",487,We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",488,"Never again, no matter what Thorne says."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",489,He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",490,"You are in love, Lord Snow."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",491,You girls can do as you please.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",492,"But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",493,I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",494,No one touches Sam.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",495,What are you waiting for?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",496,Attack him!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",497,You get in there.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",498,Hit me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",499,"Go on, hit me!"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",500,I yield!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",501,Yield. Yield.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",502,I yield.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",503,"You think this is funny, do you?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",504,"When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",505,do you want a man at your back?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",506,Or a snivelling boy?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",507,You send this whore to give me commands?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",508,I should have sent you back her head!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",509,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",510,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",511,"Yes, Khaleesi."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",512,- Why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",513,- You do not command me. - I wasn't commanding you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",514,I just wanted to invite you to supper.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",515,- What's this? - It's a gift.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",516,- I had it made for you. - Dothraki rags?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",517,- Are you going to dress me now? - Please.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",518,This stinks of manure. All of it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",519,Stop. Stop. Stop it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",520,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",521,- Next you'll want to braid my hair. - You've no right to a braid.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",522,- You've won no victories yet. - You do not talk back to me!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",523,You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",524,I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",525,I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",526,The next time you raise a hand to me
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",527,will be the last time you have hands.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",528,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",529,I wouldn't doubt it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",530,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",531,Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little Sally on the side?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",532,"- Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",533,"What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",534,- It's absurd. - I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",535,Why not?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",536,Because I'm fat?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",537,- No. - But I like girls just as much as you do.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",538,They might not like me as much.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",539,I've never... been with one.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",540,You've probably had hundreds.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",541,No.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",542,"As a matter of fact,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",543,I'm the same as you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",544,"Yeah. Yeah, I..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",545,I find that hard to believe.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",546,I came very close once.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",547,"I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",548,- Didn't know where to put it? - I know where to put it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",549,Was she...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",550,old and ugly?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",551,Young and gorgeous.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",552,A whore named Ros.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",553,What colour hair?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",554,"- Red. - Oh, I like red hair."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",555,"And her, um..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",556,Her...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",557,"- You don't want to know. - What, that good?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",558,"- Better. - Oh, no."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",559,So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",560,- What's my name? - Jon Snow.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",561,And why is my surname Snow?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",562,Because...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",563,you're a bastard from the North.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",564,I never met my mother.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",565,My father wouldn't even tell me her name.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",566,I don't know if she's living or dead.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",567,I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",568,or a whore.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",569,So I sat there
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",570,in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",571,But I couldn't do it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",572,Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",573,"and she had a child, another bastard named Snow?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",574,It's not a good life for a child.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",575,"Ah, mmm."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",576,So...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",577,you didn't know where to put it?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",578,Enjoying yourselves?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",579,"You look cold, boys."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",580,It is a bit nippy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",581,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",582,indoors.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",583,It's still summer.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",584,Do you boys even remember the last winter?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",585,"How long has it been now? What, 10 years?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",586,I remember.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",587,Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",588,"Were there days when you just couldn't get warm,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",589,never mind how many fires your servants built?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",590,- I build my own fires. - That's admirable.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",591,"I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",592,during the last winter.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",593,It was supposed to be a two-week mission.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",594,We heard a rumour Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",595,So we went out to look for some of his men -
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",596,"capture them, gather some knowledge."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",597,The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",598,Harder than you'll ever be.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",599,They know their country better than we do.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",600,They knew there was a storm coming in.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",601,So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",602,And we got caught in the open.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",603,Wind so strong
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",604,"it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",605,"If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",606,you lost a finger to the frost.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",607,And all in darkness.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",608,You don't know cold.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",609,Neither of you do.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",610,The horses died first.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",611,"We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",612,Eating the horses was easy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",613,But later when we started to fall...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",614,That wasn't easy.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",615,"We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",616,"Soft, fat boys like you."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",617,We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",618,Soon we'll have new recruits
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",619,and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",620,"for assignment,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",621,"and they will call you men of the Night's Watch,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",622,but you'd be fools to believe it.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",623,You're boys still.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",624,And come the winter you will die...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",625,like flies.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",626,I hit him.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",627,I hit the dragon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",628,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",629,Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",630,- He is still the true king. - The truth now.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",631,Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",632,No.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",633,But the common people are waiting for him.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",634,Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",635,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",636,They don't care what games the high lords play.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",637,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",638,Home.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",639,I pray for home too.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",640,My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",641,He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",642,He'll never take us home.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",643,Lovers' quarrel?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",644,I'm sorry. Do I?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",645,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",646,- He's known... - An old friend of the family.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",647,"I've known your mother a long, long time."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",648,- Why do they call you Littlefinger? - Arya!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",649,"- Don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",650,"When I was a child, I was very small,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",651,"and I come from a little spit of land called the Fingers,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",652,"so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",653,I've been sitting here for days!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",654,Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",655,"Gods, who's that?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",656,Ser Gregor Clegane.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",657,They call him the Mountain.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",658,The Hound's older brother.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",659,- And his opponent? -  Ser Hugh of the Vale.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",660,He was Jon Arryn's squire.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",661,Look how far he's come.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",662,"Yes, yes, enough of the bloody pomp. Have at him!"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",663,Not what you were expecting?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",664,Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",665,Lovely little tale of brotherly love.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",666,"The Hound was just a pup,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",667,six years old maybe.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",668,"Gregor a few years older,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",669,"already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",670,Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",671,One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire -
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",672,"Gregor's toy,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",673,a wooden knight.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",674,"Gregor never said a word,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",675,he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",676,and shoved his face into the burning coals.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",677,"Held him there while the boy screamed,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",678,while his face melted.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",679,There aren't very many people who know that story.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",680,"- I won't tell anyone. I promise. - No, please don't."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",681,"If the Hound so much as heard you mention it,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",682,I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",683,"My lord, Her Grace the queen."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",684,- Your Grace. - You're missing your tournament.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",685,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",686,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us -
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",687,the ugliness with the wolves.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",688,And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",689,Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",690,How is Sansa?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",691,- She likes it here. - She's the only Stark who does.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",692,"Favours her mother, not much of the North in her."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",693,- What are you doing here? - I might ask the same of you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",694,What is it you hope to accomplish?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",695,"The king called on me to serve him and the realm,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",696,and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",697,You can't change him. You can't help him.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",698,"He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",699,You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",700,"If that's my job, then so be it."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",701,"You're just a soldier, aren't you?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",702,You take your orders and you carry on.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",703,I suppose it makes sense.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",704,Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",705,"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",706,As was I.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",707,"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",708,And to you.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",709,"Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",710,"Ah, good idea, Grandfather. I'm starving."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",711,- A song while we wait or? - I'd rather throw myself down a well.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",712,"Now, now, Grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading North."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",713,The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",714,Gods.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",715,"I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",716,- Every room. -  My men can sleep in the stable.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",717,"As for myself, I don't require a large room."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",718,"- Truly, my lord, we have nothing. - Is there nothing I can do..."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",719,...to remedy this?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",720,- You can have my room. - Now there's a clever man.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",721,"You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",722,"- Aye, my lord. - My lord of Lannister!"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",723,Might I entertain you while you eat?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",724,I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",725,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",726,Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",727,I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",728,Lady Stark!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",729,I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",730,"You, ser."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",731,Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",732,"It is, my lady."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",733,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",734,"to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",735,She is.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",736,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",737,My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",738,Our lord is honoured by his trust.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",739,"I envy your father all his fine friends, Lady Stark,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",740,but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",741,I know your sigil as well -
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",742,the twin towers of Frey.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",743,"How fares your lord, ser?"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",744,"Lord Walder is well, my lady."
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",745,He has asked your father for the honour of his presence on his 90th nameday.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",746,- He plans to take another wife. -  Ha!
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",747,This man...
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",748,came into my house as a guest
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",749,and there conspired to murder my son.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",750,A boy of 10.
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",751,"In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve,"
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",752,I call upon you to seize him
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",753,and help me return him to Winterfell
S01E04,"Cripples, Bastards, And Broken Things",754,to await the king's justice.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,1,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,2,No.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,3,I stood vigil for him myself last night.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,4,He had no one else.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,5,He'd never worn this armour before.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,6,Bad luck for him - going against the Mountain.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,7,Who determines the draw?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,8,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,9,Aye.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,10,But who holds the straws?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,11,"You've done good work, Sisters."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,12,Life is strange.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,13,Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,14,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,15,As is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,16,You're too modest.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,17,I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,18,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,19,I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,20,"He was a fine man, your father."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,21,What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,22,And that lad -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,23,he was a squire until a few months ago.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,24,How could he afford a new suit of armour?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,25,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,26,"- I hear the king wants to joust today. - Yes, that will never happen."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,27,Robert tends to do what he wants.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,28,"If the king got what he wanted all the time,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,29,he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,30,"It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,31,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,32,Did you know that?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,33,Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,34,He can't even put a man's armour on him properly.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,35,- You're too fat for your armour. - Fat?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,36,"Fat, is it?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,37,Is that how you speak to your king?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,38,"Oh, it's funny, is it?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,39,"- No, Your Grace. - No?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,40,You don't like the Hand's joke?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,41,You're torturing the poor boy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,42,You heard the Hand. The king's too fat for his armour.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,43,Go find the breastplate stretcher - now!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,44,"""The breastplate stretcher""?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,45,How long before he figures it out?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,46,"- Maybe you should have one invented. - All right, all right."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,47,You watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,48,You've no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,49,"Why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,50,- And who's going to hit you back? - Anybody who can.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,51,- And the last man in his saddle... - Will be you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,52,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,53,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,54,Aye.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,55,- Drink. - I'm not thirsty.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,56,Drink. Your king commands it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,57,"Gods,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,58,too fat for my armour.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,59,Your squire - a Lannister boy?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,60,"Mm. A bloody idiot,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,61,but Cersei insisted.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,62,I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,63,"""Cersei Lannister will make a good match,"" he told me."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,64,"""You'll need her father on your side."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,65,I thought being king meant I could do whatever I wanted.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,66,Enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,67,At least I can smell someone else's blood.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,68,- Robert. - What?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,69,Oh.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,70,"An inspiring sight for the people, eh?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,71,"Come, bow before your king! Bow, you shits!"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,72,- Where's Arya? - At her dancing lessons.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,73,The Knight of the Flowers.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,74,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,75,Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,76,- Hey. - I can't watch.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,77,A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,78,- I'll take that bet. - Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,79,A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,80,Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,81,- Or you could even buy a friend. - He's going to die.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,82,Ser Loras rides well.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,83,"Such a shame, Littlefinger."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,84,It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,85,"And tell me, Lord Renly,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,86,when will you be having your friend?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,87,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,88,Ser Loras would never do that.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,89,- There's no honour in tricks. - No honour and quite a bit of gold.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,90,Sword!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,91,Leave him be!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,92,Stop this madness in the name of your king!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,93,Let him go!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,94,"I owe you my life, ser."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,95,I'm no ser.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,96,Remove his hood.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,97,"# On that eve, the captive Imp"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,98,# Downwards from his horse did limp
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,99,# No more would he preen and primp
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,100,# In garb of red and gold #
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,101,This isn't the Kingsroad.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,102,- You said we were riding for Winterfell. - I did... Often and loudly.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,103,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,104,looking for me in the wrong place.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,105,Word's probably gotten to my father by now.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,106,He'll be offering a handsome reward.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,107,Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,108,Would you be so good as to untie me?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,109,- And why would I do that? - Why not?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,110,Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,111,Unless a shadowcat ate me first.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,112,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,113,"Ah, the eastern road."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,114,We're going to the Vale.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,115,You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,116,"Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,117,- Five years ago. - She's changed.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,118,"She was always a bit touched, but now... You might as well kill me here."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,119,"- I am not a murderer, Lannister. - Neither am I."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,120,I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,121,- The dagger found... - What sort of imbecile
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,122,arms an assassin with his own blade?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,123,- Should I gag him? - Why?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,124,Am I starting to make sense?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,125,Rodrik!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,126,"My lady, this way."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,127,Untie me.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,128,"If I die, what's the point?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,129,Ah!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,130,"- Rodrik? - I'll be fine, my lady."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,131,There's no need to bloody yourself.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,132,Your first?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,133,You need a woman.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,134,Nothing like a woman after a fight.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,135,I'm willing if she is.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,136,Bran.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,137,The Iron Islands. Sigil - a kraken.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,138,"Words - ""We do not sow."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,139,- Lords? - The Greyjoys.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,140,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,141,And failed rebellions.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,142,"Sigil - a stag, a crowned stag now that Robert's king."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,143,"- Good. - Words - ""Ours is the fury."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,144,- Lords - the Baratheons. - Mm-hm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,145,The Westerlands.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,146,- Sigil - a lion. - Mmm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,147,"- Words - ""A Lannister always pays his debts."" - No."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,148,"A common saying, but not their official motto."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,149,Lords - the Lannisters.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,150,- We're still on their words. - I don't know them.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,151,You do know them. Think.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,152,"""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,153,"- That's House Martell. - ""Righteous in wrath."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,154,"- House Hornwood. - ""Family, duty, honour."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,155,Those are Tully words - your mother's.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,156,"- Are we playing a game? - Family, duty, honour..."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,157,- Is that the right order? - You know it is.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,158,Family comes first?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,159,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,160,How can she protect the family
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,161,if she's not with her family?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,162,Your mother sat by your bed
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,163,for three weeks while you slept.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,164,And then she left!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,165,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,166,I placed you in her arms.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,167,"From that moment until the moment she dies,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,168,she will love you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,169,Absolutely.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,170,- Fiercely. - Why did she leave?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,171,"I still can't tell you,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,172,- but she will be home soon. - Do you know where she is now?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,173,Today?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,174,"- No, I don't. - Then how can you promise me"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,175,she'll be home soon?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,176,Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,177,I'll never shoot another arrow.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,178,And where is that written?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,179,- You need legs to work a bow. - Hmm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,180,"If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,181,you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,182,Really?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,183,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,184,Why shouldn't you?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,185,"Shh, keep it down."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,186,You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,187,I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,188,Important enough for the likes of you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,189,"You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,190,"Who, the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,191,Jealous?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,192,Why should I be jealous?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,193,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,194,What's a dwarf like down below?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,195,I've always wondered.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,196,- Might surprise you. - Hmm?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,197,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,198,Generous tipper.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,199,I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,200,You are jealous.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,201,I'm a Greyjoy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,202,We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,203,"There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,204,not even the Lannisters.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,205,And what about the Starks?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,206,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,207,A ward - that's a nice word for it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,208,Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,209,My father fought for the freedom of his people.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,210,What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,211,You're a very serious boy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,212,"- I'm not a boy. - Oh, yes, you are."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,213,A serious boy with a serious cock.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,214,I don't want to pay for it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,215,Then get yourself a wife.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,216,Come on.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,217,I'm not gonna hurt you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,218,"How is your son, my lord?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,219,He'll never walk again.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,220,But his mind is sound?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,221,So they say.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,222,"A blessing, then."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,223,I suffered an early mutilation myself.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,224,Some doors close forever...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,225,others open in most unexpected places.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,226,May I?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,227,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,228,off comes my head.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,229,And who would mourn poor Varys then?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,230,"North or South, they sing no songs for spiders."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,231,But there are things you must know.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,232,You are the King's Hand and the king is a fool -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,233,"your friend, I know, but a fool - and doomed unless you save him."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,234,I've been in the capital a month.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,235,Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,236,I didn't trust you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,237,So why do you trust me now?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,238,The queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,239,There are few men of honour in the capital.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,240,You are one of them.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,241,"I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,242,What sort of doom does the king face?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,243,The same sort as Jon Arryn.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,244,"The tears of lys, they call it."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,245,"A rare and costly thing,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,246,as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,247,Who gave it to him?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,248,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,249,There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,250,There was one boy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,251,All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,252,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,253,"Pity, what happened to him,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,254,just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,255,If Ser Hugh poisoned him...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,256,who paid Ser Hugh?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,257,- Someone who could afford it. - Jon was a man of peace.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,258,He was Hand for 17 years - 17 good years.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,259,Why kill him?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,260,He started asking questions.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,261,He's found one bastard already.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,262,He has the book.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,263,The rest will come.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,264,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,265,The gods alone know.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,266,The fools tried to kill his son.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,267,What's worse - they botched it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,268,The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,269,"- We will be at war soon, my friend. -  What good is war now?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,270,We're not ready.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,271,"If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,272,This Hand is not the other.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,273,We need time.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,274,Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,275,"- You know what these savages are. - ""Delay,"" you say."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,276,"""Move fast,"" I reply."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,277,This is no longer a game for two players.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,278,It never was.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,279,The first to arrive and the last to leave.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,280,I admire your industry.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,281,You do move quietly.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,282,We all have our qualities.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,283,You look a bit lonely today.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,284,You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,285,- First boy is on the house. - I think you're mistaking
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,286,- business with pleasure. - Am I?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,287,All those birds that whisper in your ear - such pretty little things.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,288,"Trust me,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,289,we accommodate all inclinations.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,290,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,291,I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion - both equally important.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,292,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,293,Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,294,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,295,And I heard the most awful rumour about a certain lord
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,296,with a taste for fresh cadavers.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,297,Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,298,The logistics alone...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,299,to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,300,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the king's laws."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,301,Strictly speaking.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,302,Tell me. Does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,303,I've often wondered.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,304,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,305,And we had been so close.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,306,But enough about me. How have you been
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,307,since we last saw each other?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,308,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,309,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,310,- Saw me with your own eyes? - Eyes I own.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,311,Council business.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,312,We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,313,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,314,If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,315,and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,316,to think a simple word to the queen...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,317,- One shudders at the thought. - Ooh.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,318,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,319,even more recently than you have seen me.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,320,- Have you? - Yes.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,321,"Earlier today, I distinctly recall"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,322,seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,323,Was that you under the bed?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,324,And not long after that
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,325,when I saw you escorting a certain
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,326,foreign dignitary...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,327,Council business?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,328,"Of course, you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,329,"You're from there yourself, after all."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,330,"We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,331,I'd like to think we are.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,332,"So you can imagine my burden,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,333,wondering if the king might question my friend's sympathies.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,334,"To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,335,turning right loyalty to the realm...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,336,"- Oh, please. - To find myself in a position"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,337,where a simple word to the king...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,338,What are you two conspiring about?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,339,"Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,340,- My brother is coming. - To a small council meeting?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,341,Disturbing news from far away.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,342,Hadn't you heard?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,343,Off with you. No begging.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,344,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,345,D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,346,I want to see my father.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,347,"I want to fuck the queen, for all the good it does me."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,348,"You want your father, boy?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,349,"He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,350,My father is Hand of the King!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,351,I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,352,"And if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,353,Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,354,on the ear to help with your hearing?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,355,You know I had half my guard out searching for you?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,356,- You promised me this would stop. - They said they were going to kill you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,357,"- Who did? - I didn't see them,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,358,"- but I think one was fat. - Oh, Arya."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,359,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,360,and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,361,Something about the savage.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,362,"- Where did you hear this? - In the dungeons,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,363,- near the dragon skulls. - What were you doing in the dungeons?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,364,Chasing a cat.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,365,"Pardon, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,366,There's a night's watchman here begging a word. Says it's urgent.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,367,"- Your name, friend? - Yoren, if it please."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,368,- This must be your son. He has the look. - I'm a girl!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,369,Did Benjen send you?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,370,"No one sent me, my lord. I'm here to find men for the Wall,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,371,see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,372,"- Oh, we'll find recruits for you. - Thank you, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,373,But that's not why I disturb you now.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,374,"Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black -"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,375,makes him as much my brother as yours.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,376,It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,377,There are others riding too.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,378,The whole city will know by tomorrow.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,379,Know what?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,380,"Best said in private, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,381,Go on. We'll talk more later.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,382,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,383,"Come along, my lady. You heard your father."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,384,- How many guards does my father have? - Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,385,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,386,"No fear on that count, little lady."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,387,"- Well? - It's about your wife, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,388,She's taken the Imp.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,389,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,390,"- To whom do I speak? - Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,391,- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit? - There was no time to send word.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,392,"May I ask, my lady,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,393,why he is with you?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,394,That's why there was no time.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,395,- He is my prisoner. - He doesn't look like a prisoner.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,396,My sister will decide what he looks like.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,397,"Yes, my lady. She will at that."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,398,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,399,"Give me ten good men and some climbing spikes,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,400,I'll impregnate the bitch.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,401,I like you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,402,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,403,in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,404,I need to see the king first - alone.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,405,"The king is at the small council meeting, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,406,He has summoned you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,407,"- Is it about my wife? - No, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,408,I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,409,- The whore is pregnant. - You're speaking of murdering a child.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,410,"I warned you this would happen, back in the North."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,411,"I warned you, but you didn't care to hear."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,412,"Well, hear it now."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,413,"I want 'em dead, mother and child both."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,414,And that fool Viserys as well.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,415,Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,416,You will dishonour yourself forever if you do this.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,417,Honour?! I've got seven kingdoms to rule!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,418,"One king, seven kingdoms."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,419,Do you think honour keeps them in line?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,420,Do you think it's honour that's keeping the peace?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,421,- It's fear - fear and blood. - Then we're no better than the Mad King.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,422,"- Careful, Ned. Careful now. - You want to assassinate a girl"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,423,because the spider heard a rumour?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,424,"No rumour, my lord. The princess is with child."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,425,- Based on whose information? - Ser Jorah Mormont.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,426,He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,427,Mormont? You bring us the whispers
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,428,of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,429,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,430,"Small difference, I know, to an honourable man."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,431,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,432,We commit murder on the word of this man?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,433,And if he's right? If she has a son?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,434,A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,435,- what then? - The Narrow Sea still lies between us.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,436,I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,437,Do nothing?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,438,That's your wise advice?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,439,Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,440,You're my council. Counsel!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,441,Speak sense to this honourable fool.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,442,"I understand your misgivings, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,443,"Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,444,"we must consider, a vile thing."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,445,Yet we who presume to rule
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,446,must sometimes do vile things
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,447,for the good of the realm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,448,"Should the gods grant Daenerys a son,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,449,"- the realm will bleed. - I bear this girl no ill will,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,450,"but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,451,How many towns will burn?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,452,"Is it not wiser, kinder even,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,453,that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,454,We should have had them both killed years ago.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,455,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,456,"best close your eyes, get it over with."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,457,Cut her throat. Be done with it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,458,I followed you into war -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,459,"twice,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,460,"without doubts,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,461,without second thoughts.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,462,But I will not follow you now.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,463,The Robert I grew up with
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,464,didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,465,She dies.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,466,I will have no part in it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,467,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,468,You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,469,And good luck to him.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,470,"- I thought you were a better man. - Out. Out, damn you."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,471,I'm done with you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,472,"Go, run back to Winterfell!"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,473,I'll have your head on a spike!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,474,"I'll put it there myself, you fool!"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,475,You think you're too good for this?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,476,Too proud and honourable? This is a war!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,477,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,478,"- Don't ask anyone for help. - Right away, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,479,Lord Baelish is here for you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,480,His Grace went on about you at some length
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,481,"after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,482,- What can I do for you? - When do you return to Winterfell?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,483,"- Why? What do you care? - If you're still here come nightfall,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,484,I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,485,If that sort of thing still interests you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,486,I don't have the time.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,487,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,488,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,489,- Who are your best two swords? - Heward and Wyl.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,490,Find them and meet me at the stables.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,491,You bring him here without permission?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,492,You pollute my home with his presence?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,493,"Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,494,"You remember her, don't you?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,495,Isn't he beautiful?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,496,And strong too. Jon knew it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,497,"His last words were ""The seed is strong."""
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,498,"He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,499,his son would grow up to be.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,500,"Look at him, the lord of all the Vale."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,501,"Lysa,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,502,"you wrote me about the Lannisters,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,503,- warning me... - To stay away from them!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,504,Not to bring one here!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,505,Mummy...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,506,- is that the bad man? - It is.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,507,He's little.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,508,"He's Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,509,He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,510,"Oh, did I kill him too?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,511,- I've been a very busy man. - You will watch your tongue!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,512,These men are knights of the Vale.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,513,Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,514,Every one of them would die for me.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,515,"If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,516,"You can't hurt us. No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,517,"- Tell him! - Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,518,He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,519,No one will hurt my baby.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,520,Mummy...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,521,I want to see the bad man fly.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,522,"- Perhaps you will, my little love. - This man is my prisoner."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,523,I will not have him harmed.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,524,"Ser Vardis,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,525,my sister's guest is weary.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,526,Take him down below so he can rest.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,527,Introduce him to Mord.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,528,"You go sleep, dwarf man."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,529,"Sleep good, little dwarf man!"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,530,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,531,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,532,- He adores the man. - You're jealous.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,533,- Are you sure this won't hurt? - Only if I slip.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,534,- And you'd prefer me like this? - Mm-hm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,535,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,536,I want you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,537,My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,538,He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,539,"Oh, and you're not?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,540,"Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,541,How many wars have you fought in?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,542,"Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armour of yours?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,543,Hold still.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,544,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,545,how I squirm at the sight of blood.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,546,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,547,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,548,He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,549,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,550,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,551,I'm good because I work at it -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,552,every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,553,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, I'd still never be as good as you."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,554,"Yes, well, I guess we'll never know."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,555,- Everywhere? - Everywhere.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,556,So how did it end up?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,557,"- The Targaryen girl will die? - It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,558,Robert's rather tasteless about it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,559,"Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,560,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,561,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,562,You have to give it to the Lannisters - they may be
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,563,"the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,564,but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,565,- I have an outrageous amount of money. - Not as much as the Lannisters.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,566,But a lot more than you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,567,Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,568,Last time we were out there for two weeks.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,569,"Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,570,all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,571,Oh. But Robert loves his killing.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,572,- And he's the king. - Hmm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,573,- How did that ever happen? - Because he loves his killing.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,574,And he used to be good at it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,575,Do you know who should be king?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,576,- Be serious. - I am.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,577,My father could be your bank.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,578,"I've never fought in a war before,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,579,- but I'd fight for you. - I'm fourth in line.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,580,And where's Robert in the line of royal succession?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,581,Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,582,- Stannis? - Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,583,He's still my older brother.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,584,- What are you doing?! - Look at it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,585,- You cut me. - It's just blood. We've all got it in us.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,586,Sometimes a little spills.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,587,"If you become king, you're going to see a lot of this."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,588,You need to get used to it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,589,Go on. Look.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,590,People love you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,591,They love to serve you because you're kind to them.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,592,They want to be near you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,593,"You're willing to do what needs to be done,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,594,but you don't gloat over it.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,595,You don't love killing.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,596,Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,597,That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,598,You would be a wonderful king.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,599,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,600,You seemed so good together.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,601,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,602,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,603,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,604,No.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,605,He's not serious enough.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,606,I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,607,Hmm.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,608,Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,609,I don't know.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,610,But I do know this -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,611,if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,612,and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,613,we won't be able to stop them.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,614,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,615,They don't have discipline. They don't have armour.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,616,- They don't have siege weapons. - It's a neat little trick you do -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,617,you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,618,Is my father wrong?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,619,Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,620,"with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,621,We hole up in our castles.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,622,A wise move -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,623,only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,624,They leave us in our castles.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,625,"They go from town to town, looting and burning,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,626,"killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,627,"stealing all our crops and livestock,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,628,enslaving all our women and children.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,629,How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,630,"their absentee king, their cowardly king"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,631,hiding behind high walls?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,632,When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,633,is the rightful monarch after all?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,634,We still outnumber them.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,635,Which is the bigger number - five or one?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,636,Five.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,637,Five...
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,638,One.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,639,One army - a real army
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,640,united behind one leader with one purpose.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,641,Our purpose died with the Mad King.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,642,Now we've got as many armies
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,643,as there are men with gold in their purse.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,644,And everybody wants something different.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,645,Your father wants to own the world.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,646,Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,647,What do you want?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,648,We haven't had a real fight in nine years.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,649,Backstabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,650,And that's all the realm is now -
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,651,backstabbing and scheming
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,652,and arse-licking and money-grubbing.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,653,Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,654,Our marriage.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,655,"Ah, so here we sit,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,656,"17 years later, holding it all together."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,657,Don't you get tired?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,658,Every day.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,659,How long can hate hold a thing together?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,660,"Well, 17 years is quite a long time."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,661,"Yes, it is."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,662,"Yes, it is."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,663,What was she like?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,664,"You've never asked about her, not once."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,665,Why not?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,666,"At first, just saying her name even in private"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,667,felt like I was breathing life back into her.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,668,"I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,669,"When I realised that wasn't going to happen,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,670,I refused to ask out of spite.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,671,I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,672,And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,673,"As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,674,So why now?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,675,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,676,that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,677,You want to know the horrible truth?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,678,I can't even remember what she looked like.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,679,I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,680,"Someone took her away from me,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,681,and seven kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,682,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,683,I know.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,684,Even after we lost our first boy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,685,"For quite a while, actually."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,686,"Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,687,No.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,688,Does that make you feel better or worse?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,689,It doesn't make me feel anything.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,690,"She looks like him,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,691,"don't she, my lord?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,692,"She has his nose, his black hair."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,693,Aye.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,694,"Tell him when you see him, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,695,"If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,696,- I will. - And tell him I've been with no one else.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,697,"I swear it, my lord, by the old gods and new."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,698,"I don't want no jewels or nothing,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,699,just him.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,700,The king was always good to me.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,701,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,702,"- what did he want? - He wasn't that sort of man, my lord."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,703,"He just wanted to know if the child was happy,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,704,healthy.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,705,Looks healthy enough to me.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,706,The girl shall want for nothing.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,707,"Brothels make a much better investment than ships,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,708,I've found.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,709,Whores rarely sink.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,710,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,711,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,712,- How many? - Does it matter?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,713,"If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,714,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,715,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,716,He was overcome with fatherly love.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,717,Come.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,718,- Jory! - My lord.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,719,Such a small pack of wolves.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,720,"Stay back, ser. This is the Hand of the King."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,721,Was the Hand of the King.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,722,Now I'm not sure what he is - lord of somewhere very far away.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,723,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,724,Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,725,"You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,726,"Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,727,- I remember him well. - It seems he had some trouble on the road.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,728,"You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,729,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,730,My lords!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,731,I'll bring the City Watch.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,732,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,733,- If you threaten my lord again... - Threaten?
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,734,"As in, ""I'm going to open your lord"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,735,"""from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of""?"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,736,"You kill me,"
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,737,your brother's a dead man.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,738,You're right.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,739,Take him alive. Kill his men.
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,740,Yah!
S01E05,The Wolf And The Lion,741,"My brother, Lord Stark - we want him back."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,1,"Your pardon, Your Grace."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,2,"I would rise, but..."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,3,Do you know what your wife has done?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,4,- She did nothing I did not command. - Who'd have thought she had it in her?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,5,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,6,- I am the King's Hand... - You were the King's Hand!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,7,You shall now be held accountable.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,8,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,9,Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,10,He butchered my men.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,11,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,12,"- Quiet, woman. - Jaime has fled the city."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,13,Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,14,I took you for a king.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,15,Hold your tongue.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,16,He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,17,I should wear the armour and you the gown.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,18,I shall wear this like a badge of honour.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,19,Wear it in silence or I'll honour you again.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,20,See what she does to me?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,21,My loving wife.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,22,I should not have hit her.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,23,That was not...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,24,That was not kingly.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,25,If we don't act...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,26,there will be a war.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,27,So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,28,"She's had her fun, now put an end to it."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,29,You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,30,And what about Jaime Lannister?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,31,What about Jaime?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,32,I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,33,I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,34,I don't want to know. This is what matters -
S01E06,A Golden Crown,35,I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters
S01E06,A Golden Crown,36,"are at each other's throats, so enough."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,37,"As you command, Your Grace."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,38,With your leave...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,39,I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,40,Piss on that. Send a raven. I want you to stay.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,41,I'm the king. I get what I want.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,42,I never loved my brothers.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,43,"A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,44,You were the brother I chose.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,45,We'll talk when I return from the hunt.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,46,The hunt?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,47,Killing things clears my head.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,48,You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,49,You'll hate it more than I do.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,50,- The Targaryen girl... - Seven hells!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,51,Don't start with her again!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,52,The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,53,"Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,54,I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,55,Khaleesi?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,56,"Oh, Khaleesi!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,57,You're hurt.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,58,"- Not too fast. - Come on, Dancer."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,59,When are you gonna tell him?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,60,Not now.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,61,- Blood for blood. -  Come on!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,62,You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,63,- You're talking about war. - I'm talking about justice.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,64,Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,65,A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,66,The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,67,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,68,- You're not a boy anymore. -  Come on.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,69,They attacked your father. They've already started the war.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,70,It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,71,"And it's not your duty, because it's not your House."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,72,Where's Bran?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,73,I don't know.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,74,It's not my House.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,75,Robb?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,76,"All alone in the deep, dark woods."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,77,I'm not alone. My brother is with me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,78,I don't see him.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,79,Got him hidden under your cloak?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,80,"Ooh, that's a pretty pin."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,81,Silver.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,82,We'll take the pin and the horse. Get down.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,83,Be quick about it.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,84,I can't.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,85,The saddle... The straps.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,86,What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,87,I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,88,"If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,89,Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,90,The boy's worth nothing dead.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,91,Benjen Stark's own blood?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,92,Think what Mance would give us.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,93,Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,94,We're going as far south as south goes.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,95,There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,96,Drop the knife!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,97,Let him go and I'll let you live.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,98,Robb.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,99,- Robb. - Shut up.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,100,Drop the blade!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,101,"- No, don't. - Do it."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,102,Are you all right?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,103,Yes. It doesn't hurt.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,104,Tough little lad.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,105,"In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,106,Well done.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,107,Have you lost your mind?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,108,What if you'd missed?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,109,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,110,- You don't have the right... - To save your brother's life?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,111,"It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,112,What about her?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,113,"Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,114,We'll keep her alive.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,115,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,116,Turnkey! Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,117,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,118,Dwarf man making noise!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,119,How would you like to be rich?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,120,Dwarf man still making noise.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,121,My family is rich.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,122,"We have gold, lots of gold."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,123,I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,124,No gold!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,125,"Well, I don't have it here."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,126,No gold!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,127,Fuck off.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,128,I don't want to practice today.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,129,No?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,130,They killed Jory.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,131,My father is hurt.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,132,I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,133,You are troubled.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,134,- Yes. - Good!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,135,Trouble is the perfect time for training.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,136,"When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,137,this is not when fighting happens.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,138,I don't like dolls and k...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,139,You're not here.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,140,You're with your trouble.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,141,If you are with your trouble when fighting happens...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,142,...more trouble for you.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,143,Just so.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,144,How can you be quick as a snake...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,145,...or as quiet as a shadow...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,146,...when you are somewhere else?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,147,"You are fearing for your father, hmm?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,148,That is right.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,149,- Do you pray to the gods? - The old and the new.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,150,There is only one god...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,151,and his name is death.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,152,And there is only one thing we say to death -
S01E06,A Golden Crown,153,"""Not today."""
S01E06,A Golden Crown,154,She has to eat the whole heart?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,155,I hope that wasn't my horse.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,156,She's doing well.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,157,She'll never keep it down.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,158,Tell me what she's saying.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,159,"""The prince is riding."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,160,"""I have heard the thunder of his hooves."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,161,"""Swift as the wind he rides."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,162,"""His enemies will cower before him..."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,163,"""...and their wives will weep tears of blood."""
S01E06,A Golden Crown,164,She's going to have a boy.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,165,He won't be a real Targaryen.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,166,He won't be a true dragon.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,167,"""The stallion who mounts the world."""
S01E06,A Golden Crown,168,The stallion is the khal of khals.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,169,He shall unite the people into a single khalasar.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,170,All the people of the world will be his herd.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,171,A prince rides inside me!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,172,And he shall be called Rhaego!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,173,Rhaego! Rhaego!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,174,Rhaego! Rhaego!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,175,Rhaego! Rhaego...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,176,They love her.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,177,Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,178,She truly is a queen today.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,179,Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,180,You know the law.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,181,It's not my law.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,182,They don't belong to you.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,183,Whatever is hers is also mine.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,184,"Once, perhaps."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,185,"If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,186,Two eggs - a ship and an army.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,187,- And you have all three. - I need a large army.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,188,"I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,189,The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen
S01E06,A Golden Crown,190,"on my shoulders since I was five years old,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,191,and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,192,Not a piece of it.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,193,How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,194,Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,195,"Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honour."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,196,"You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,197,Don't think I know what you want?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,198,I don't care. You can have her.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,199,"She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,200,and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,201,But let me go.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,202,You can go.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,203,You can't have the eggs.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,204,You swore an oath to me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,205,Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,206,It means everything to me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,207,And yet here you stand.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,208,And yet here I stand.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,209,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,210,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,211,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,212,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,213,Mord!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,214,Noise again!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,215,- About the gold... - No gold!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,216,- No gold. - Listen to me! Listen to me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,217,Sometimes possession...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,218,is an abstract concept...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,219,"When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,220,Where?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,221,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me..."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,222,You want free?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,223,Go be free.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,224,Have you ever heard the phrase...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,225,"""Rich as a Lannister""?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,226,Of course you have!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,227,You're a smart man.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,228,You know who the Lannisters are.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,229,I am a Lannister.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,230,"Tyrion, son of Tywin!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,231,"And of course, you have also heard the phrase,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,232,"""a Lannister always pays his debts."""
S01E06,A Golden Crown,233,If you deliver a message from me...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,234,"to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,235,I will owe you gold.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,236,If you deliver the message...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,237,"and I live, which I very much intend to do."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,238,What message?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,239,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,240,You wish to confess your crimes?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,241,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,242,The sky cells always break them.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,243,"Speak, Imp."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,244,Meet your gods as an honest man.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,245,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,246,"I'm a vile man, I confess it."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,247,My crimes and sins are beyond counting.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,248,I have lied and cheated...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,249,gambled and whored.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,250,"I'm not particularly good at violence, but..."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,251,I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,252,"You want specifics, I suppose."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,253,"When I was seven, I saw a servant girl... bathing in the river."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,254,I stole her robe.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,255,She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,256,"If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,257,"When I was 10, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,258,"When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,259,Poor boy was flogged and... I escaped justice.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,260,When I was 12 I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,261,I flogged the one-eyed snake.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,262,I skinned my sausage.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,263,"I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,264,which I do believe my sister ate.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,265,At least I hope she did.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,266,I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,267,Silence!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,268,What happened next?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,269,What do you think you're doing?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,270,Confessing my crimes.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,271,"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,272,and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband -
S01E06,A Golden Crown,273,"Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,274,"Oh, I'm very sorry."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,275,I don't know anything about all that.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,276,You've had your little joke.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,277,I trust you enjoyed it.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,278,"Mord, take him back to the dungeon."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,279,But this time find a smaller cell... with a steeper floor.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,280,Is this how justice is done in the Vale?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,281,"You accuse me of crimes,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,282,"I deny them,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,283,so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,284,Where is the king's justice?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,285,I am accused and demand a trial!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,286,"If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,287,I understand the law.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,288,We have no executioner in the Eyrie.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,289,Life is more elegant here.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,290,Open the Moon Door.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,291,"You want a trial, my Lord Lannister."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,292,Very well.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,293,"My son will listen to whatever you have to say,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,294,and you will hear his judgment.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,295,Then you will leave...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,296,by one door or the other.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,297,No need to bother Lord Robin.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,298,I demand a trial by combat.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,299,You have that right.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,300,"My lady, I beg the honour."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,301,Let me be your champion.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,302,The honour should be mine.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,303,For the love I bore your lord husband...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,304,let me avenge his death.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,305,"- I'll fight for you, my lady. - It'll be my honour."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,306,- The honour should be mine. - Make the bad man fly!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,307,Ser Vardis...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,308,you're quiet.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,309,Don't you want to avenge my husband?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,310,"With all my heart, my lady."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,311,But the Imp is half my size.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,312,It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,313,Agreed.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,314,You demanded a trial by combat.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,315,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,316,"My lady,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,317,I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,318,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,319,"I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,320,The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,321,Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,322,The trial will be today.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,323,Do I have a volunteer?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,324,Anyone?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,325,Anyone?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,326,I think we can assume that no one is willing...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,327,I'll stand for the dwarf.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,328,"More wine, Your Grace?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,329,- What was I saying? -  Simpler time.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,330,It was! It was. You're too young to remember.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,331,"Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,332,"- It was, Your Grace. - The enemy was right there in the open,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,333,"vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,334,Nothing like today.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,335,"- It sounds exhilarating. - Exhilarating, yes."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,336,Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,337,You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,338,Once. I think.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,339,You think? I think you'd remember.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,340,"Back in our day, you weren't a real man"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,341,until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms
S01E06,A Golden Crown,342,and the Riverlands.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,343,"- We used to call it ""making the eight."" - Those were some lucky girls."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,344,"You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,345,"I don't believe so, Your Grace."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,346,Those were the days.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,347,"Which days, exactly?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,348,The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,349,"Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,350,because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,351,"Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,352,"Easy, boy."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,353,"You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the king."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,354,I suppose it was all rather heroic.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,355,If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore
S01E06,A Golden Crown,356,to shove your prick inside and make the eight.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,357,"More wine, Your Grace?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,358,They burned most everything in the Riverlands -
S01E06,A Golden Crown,359,"our fields, our granaries,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,360,our homes.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,361,"They took our women, then they took 'em again."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,362,"When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,363,They covered our children in pitch...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,364,and lit them on fire.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,365,"Brigands, most likely."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,366,They weren't thieves. They didn't steal nothing.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,367,"They even left something behind, Your Grace."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,368,"It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,369,The king is hunting.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,370,Fish. The sigil of House Tully.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,371,Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,372,"These men, were they flying a sigil?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,373,"- A banner? - None, your... Hand."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,374,The one who was leading them...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,375,"Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,376,"saw him cut the blacksmith in two,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,377,saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,378,That sounds like someone we know.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,379,The Mountain.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,380,You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,381,Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,382,The man is an anointed knight.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,383,I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,384,I'm sure you have as well.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,385,Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have
S01E06,A Golden Crown,386,for being angry with your wife?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,387,"If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,388,- it would be... - That would be almost as brazen
S01E06,A Golden Crown,389,as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,390,Well...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,391,"I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,392,"but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,393,Lord Beric Dondarrion.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,394,You shall have the command.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,395,Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,396,As you command.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,397,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,398,"King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,399,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,400,I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane
S01E06,A Golden Crown,401,and all those who shared in his crimes.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,402,I denounce him and attaint him.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,403,I strip him of all ranks and titles...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,404,of all lands and holdings...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,405,and sentence him to death.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,406,My lord... This... This is a drastic action.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,407,It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,408,- Grand Maester Pycelle. - My lord.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,409,Send a raven to Casterly Rock.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,410,Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court
S01E06,A Golden Crown,411,to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,412,"He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the Crown"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,413,and a traitor to the realm.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,414,"A bold move, my lord, and admirable."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,415,But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,416,Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,417,"Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,418,Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,419,Fight!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,420,Hold!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,421,"- Attack! Attack! - Come on, Ser Vardis!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,422,Attack!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,423,"Stand and fight, coward!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,424,Yes!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,425,"Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,426,What are you doing? Get up!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,427,"Get up, get up, get up!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,428,Raise your sword. Raise it!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,429,"Get up, man!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,430,"- On your feet! - Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,431,No! Have mercy!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,432,Is it over?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,433,You don't fight with honour!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,434,No.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,435,He did.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,436,Can I make the little man fly now?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,437,Not this little man.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,438,This little man is going home.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,439,I believe you have something of mine.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,440,A Lannister always pays his debts.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,441,You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,442,"Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,443,It's important to remember where you come from.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,444,I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,445,My mother isn't from the North.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,446,I'm aware of that.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,447,Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,448,Yes. I have hair.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,449,I've never seen it.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,450,Would you like to?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,451,No.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,452,Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,453,"- I come from a very small village in... - Oh, wait."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,454,I just realized... I don't care.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,455,- Sansa... - Septa.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,456,Now you are being rude.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,457,My prince.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,458,My prince.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,459,My lady.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,460,I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,461,With your permission?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,462,"It's beautiful,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,463,like the one your mother wears.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,464,You'll be queen someday.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,465,It's only fitting you should look the part.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,466,Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,467,There's nothing to forgive.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,468,You're my lady.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,469,One day we'll be married in the throne room.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,470,"Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,471,from the last hearth in the North
S01E06,A Golden Crown,472,to the salt shore in the South.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,473,And you will be queen over all of them.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,474,I'll never disrespect you again.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,475,I'll never be cruel to you again.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,476,Do you understand me?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,477,You're my lady now...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,478,from this day...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,479,until my last day.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,480,Stop.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,481,- Stop! - Whoa.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,482,- What are you doing? - Going to King's Landing.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,483,In a turnip cart?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,484,I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,485,And you can afford that?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,486,Some of my friends are more generous than others.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,487,There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,488,So I'll have lots of company.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,489,"Yes, you'll be very popular..."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,490,until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick
S01E06,A Golden Crown,491,and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,492,And what will happen to me if I stay here?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,493,"Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,494,Don't be a fool.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,495,I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,496,Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon
S01E06,A Golden Crown,497,and most of them will never come back.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,498,There's nothing left for me here.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,499,"Let's go, Steffon."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,500,Giddy up.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,501,Let me see it one more time!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,502,See what?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,503,I'm going to miss you!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,504,I know.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,505,I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,506,- What? - Listen...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,507,- What about Joffrey? - Are you dying because of your leg?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,508,- Is that why you're sending us home? - What? No.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,509,"- Please, Father. Please don't. - You can't."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,510,I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,511,This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,512,Can we take Syrio back with us?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,513,Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,514,I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen
S01E06,A Golden Crown,515,- and have his babies. - Seven hells.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,516,"When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,517,someone who's brave and gentle and strong...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,518,I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,519,"He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion,"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,520,and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,521,"The lion's not his sigil, idiot."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,522,"He's a stag, like his father."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,523,He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,524,"Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,525,- Wait! - Come on.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,526,But it's not fair!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,527,"""Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."""

S01E06,A Golden Crown,535,Where's my sister?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,536,Stop him.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,537,Where is she? Hmm?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,538,Where is she? I'm here for the feast.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,539,The whore's feast?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,540,- Come. - Get your hands off me!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,541,No one touches the dragon!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,542,Khal Drogo!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,543,I'm here for the feast.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,544,Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,545,Back there.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,546,That is no place for a king.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,547,You are no king.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,548,Keep away from me!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,549,"Viserys, please."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,550,There she is.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,551,Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,552,They can't kill us.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,553,They can't shed blood in their sacred city.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,554,But I can.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,555,I want what I came for.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,556,I want the crown he promised me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,557,He bought you.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,558,But he never paid for you.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,559,Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,560,He can keep the baby.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,561,I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,562,What's he saying?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,563,He says yes.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,564,You shall have a golden crown...
S01E06,A Golden Crown,565,...that men shall tremble to behold.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,566,That was all I wanted.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,567,W-What was promised.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,568,No!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,569,No! You cannot touch me.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,570,I am the dragon. I am the dragon!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,571,I want my crown! Ahh!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,572,"- Look away, Khaleesi. - No."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,573,"No, Dany."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,574,"Dany, tell them."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,575,Make them!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,576,"Dany, make them..."
S01E06,A Golden Crown,577,"No, you can't!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,578,Just... Please!
S01E06,A Golden Crown,579,"Dany, please!"
S01E06,A Golden Crown,580,A crown for a king.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,581,Khaleesi?
S01E06,A Golden Crown,582,He was no dragon.
S01E06,A Golden Crown,583,Fire cannot kill a dragon.

S01E07,You Win Or You Die,4,Poor Ned Stark.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,5,"Brave man, terrible judgment."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,6,Attacking him was stupid.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,7,Lannisters...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,8,don't act like fools.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,9,Are you going to say something clever?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,10,"Go on, say something clever."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,11,Catelyn Stark took my brother.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,12,- Why is he still alive? - Tyrion?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,13,Ned Stark.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,14,"One of our men interfered,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,15,speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,16,Why is he still alive?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,17,It wouldn't have been clean.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,18,Clean.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,19,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,20,I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,21,That's what you want people to think of you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,22,It's the truth.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,23,"When you hear them whispering ""kingslayer"" behind your back,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,24,doesn't it bother you?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,25,Of course it bothers me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,26,A lion doesn't concern himself
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,27,with the opinions of the sheep.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,28,I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,29,got in the way of your recklessness.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,30,I'm giving you half of our forces -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,31,"30,000 men."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,32,You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,33,and remind her that Lannisters
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,34,pay their debts.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,35,I didn't realise you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,36,He's a Lannister.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,37,"He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,38,"And every day that he remains a prisoner,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,39,the less our name commands respect.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,40,So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,41,"No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,42,If another house can seize one of our own
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,43,"and hold him captive with impunity,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,44,we are no longer a house to be feared.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,45,Your mother's dead.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,46,Before long I'll be dead.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,47,And you...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,48,and your brother and your sister
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,49,and all of her children.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,50,"All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,51,It's the family name that lives on.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,52,It's all that lives on.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,53,"Not your personal glory, not your honour,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,54,but family.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,55,Do you understand?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,56,Hmm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,57,You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,58,You're blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,59,And you're still blessed with youth.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,60,"And what have you done with these blessings, huh?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,61,You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,62,"one a madman, the other a drunk."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,63,The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,64,We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,65,"Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,66,I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,67,Not next year. Not tomorrow.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,68,Now.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,69,You're in pain.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,70,"I've had worse, my lady."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,71,Perhaps it's time to go home.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,72,The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,73,I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,74,"Do you, Lord Stark?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,75,"Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,76,Has he done this before?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,77,Jaime would have killed him. My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,78,Your brother...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,79,or your lover?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,80,The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,81,to keep bloodlines pure.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,82,Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,83,We shared a womb.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,84,We came into this world together. We belong together.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,85,My son saw you with him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,86,Do you love your children?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,87,- With all my heart. - No more than I love mine.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,88,- And they're all Jaime's. -  Thank the gods.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,89,"In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,90,I finish him off in other ways.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,91,"- In the morning, he doesn't remember. - You've always hated him."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,92,Hated him? I worshipped him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,93,"Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,94,"And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,95,"lean and fierce and black-bearded,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,96,it was the happiest moment of my life.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,97,"That night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,98,"and did what he did, what little he could do,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,99,"and whispered in my ear, ""Lyanna."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,100,Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,101,and he loved her more than me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,102,"When the king returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,103,You must be gone by then - you and your children.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,104,I will not have their blood on my hands.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,105,"Go as far away as you can,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,106,with as many men as you can.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,107,"Because wherever you go,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,108,Robert's wrath will follow you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,109,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,110,You should have taken the realm for yourself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,111,Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,112,He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,113,All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,114,Such a sad mistake.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,115,I've made many mistakes in my life...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,116,but that wasn't one of them.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,117,"Oh, but it was."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,118,"When you play the game of thrones, you win..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,119,or you die.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,120,There is no middle ground.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,121,Come here.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,122,"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,123,Oh!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,124,"Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,125,"Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,126,"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,127,Oh!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,128,"No, no, no, no!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,129,Is that what they teach you up in the North?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,130,And you - wherever you're from -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,131,do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,132,Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,133,"Yes, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,134,"Let's start over, shall we?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,135,You be the man...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,136,and you be the woman.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,137,"Well, go ahead."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,138,Slowly.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,139,You're not fooling them. They just paid you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,140,They know what you are.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,141,They know it's all just an act.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,142,Your job is to make them forget what they know.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,143,"Now, that takes time."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,144,You need to...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,145,ease into it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,146,Go ahead.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,147,Ease into it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,148,He's winning you over in spite of yourself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,149,You're starting to like this.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,150,He wants to believe you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,151,He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,152,He knows he's better than other men.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,153,He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,154,"He's so good,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,155,"he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,156,overcoming your very nature.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,157,"Why don't you join us, my lord?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,158,I'm saving myself for another.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,159,What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,160,A stupid saying.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,161,What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,162,She must be very beautiful.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,163,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,164,I do believe my lord's in love.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,165,"For many years. Most of my life, really."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,166,Play with her arse.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,167,And she loved me too.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,168,"I was her little confidant, her plaything."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,169,"She could tell me anything, anything at all."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,170,"She told me about all the horses that she liked,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,171,the castle that she wanted to live in
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,172,and the man that she wanted to marry -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,173,a Northerner... with a jaw like an anvil.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,174,So I challenged him to a duel.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,175,"I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,176,The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,177,"In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,178,"""He's just a boy,"" she said."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,179,"""Please don't hurt him."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,180,"So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,181,Is she still married to him?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,182,"Oh, no. He got himself killed before the wedding..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,183,"...and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,184,"She loves him, I'm afraid."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,185,"And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,186,He's just so...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,187,...good.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,188,"Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,189,"I learned that I'll never win, not that way."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,190,"That's their game,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,191,their rules.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,192,I'm not going to fight them.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,193,I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,194,That's what I am.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,195,And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,196,And what do you want?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,197,"Oh, everything, my dear."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,198,Everything there is.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,199,Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,200,Hmm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,201,You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,202,"Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,203,"Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,204,"at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,205,your hands and feet chained to four stakes.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,206,The sea would come in closer and closer.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,207,You'd see death creeping towards you a few inches at a time.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,208,Where is it you come from?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,209,The Iron Islands.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,210,They far away?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,211,You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,212,"Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,213,"""Trust me, my lord."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,214,You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,215,"In civilised lands, you refer to your betters"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,216,by their proper titles.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,217,- And what's that? - Lord.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,218,Why?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,219,Why?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,220,"What do you mean, why?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,221,"My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,222,What's that got to do with you?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,223,"If your father's lord,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,224,how can you be lord too?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,225,- I will be lord after my father. - So you're not lord now?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,226,"No, you..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,227,Are you having a go at me? Is that it?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,228,I just don't understand how you southerners do things.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,229,- I'm not a southerner. - You're from south of the Wall.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,230,That makes you a southerner to me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,231,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,232,"Couldn't say, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,233,"Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,234,Impudent.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,235,"It means rude, disrespectful."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,236,Do you want to lose that chain?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,237,Theon Greyjoy!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,238,The lady is our guest.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,239,I thought she was our prisoner.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,240,Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,241,Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,242,I'm used to worse than him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,243,Hmm?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,244,I'm used to men who could chew that boy up
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,245,and pick their teeth with his bones.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,246,Why did you come here?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,247,Didn't mean to come here.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,248,Meant to get much further south than this.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,249,"As far south as south goes,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,250,before the long night comes.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,251,Why? What are you afraid of?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,252,There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,253,- Owls and shadowcats... - I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,254,The things you speak of -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,255,they've been gone for thousands of years.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,256,"They wasn't gone, old man."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,257,They was sleeping.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,258,And they ain't sleeping no more.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,259,I miss girls.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,260,Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,261,"Just looking at them,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,262,hearing them giggle.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,263,Don't you miss girls?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,264,Riders.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,265,The horn. We have to blow the horn.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,266,Why is he alone?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,267,"One blast for a ranger returning,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,268,"two for wildlings,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,269,- three for... - There's no rider.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,270,"Whoa, boy, whoa."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,271,That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,272,Where's my uncle?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,273,Ned!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,274,It's Robert. We were hunting...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,275,a boar...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,276,"I should have spent more time with you,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,277,shown you how to be a man.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,278,I was never meant to be a father.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,279,Go on.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,280,You don't want to see this.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,281,My fault.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,282,"Too much wine, missed my thrust."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,283,It stinks.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,284,It stinks like death.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,285,Don't think I can't smell it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,286,"I paid the bastard back, Ned."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,287,I drove my knife right through his brain.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,288,You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'em!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,289,I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,290,And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,291,"Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,292,"- Robert, my sweet... - Out, all of you!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,293,You damned fool.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,294,Paper and ink on the table.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,295,Write down what I say.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,296,"""In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,297,"""first of..."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,298,You know how it goes.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,299,Fill in the damn titles.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,300,"""I hereby command"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,301,"""Eddard of House Stark..."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,302,"titles, titles..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,303,"""to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,304,"""upon my death,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,305,"""to rule in my stead"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,306,"""until my son Joffrey comes of age."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,307,Give it over.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,308,Give it to the council...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,309,after I'm dead.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,310,"At least they'll say I did this right,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,311,this one thing.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,312,You'll rule now.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,313,You'll hate it worse than I did...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,314,but you'll do it well.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,315,The girl...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,316,Daenerys.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,317,"You were right. Varys, Littlefinger,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,318,my brother... worthless.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,319,"No one to tell me ""no"" but you."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,320,Only you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,321,Let her live.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,322,"Stop it, if it's not too late."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,323,I will.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,324,And my son...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,325,"help him, Ned."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,326,Make him better than me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,327,I'll...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,328,I'll do everything I can to honour your memory.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,329,My memory.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,330,"King Robert Baratheon,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,331,murdered by a pig.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,332,Give me something for the pain and let me die.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,333,Give him milk of the poppy.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,334,He was reeling from the wine.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,335,He commanded us to...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,336,"step aside, but..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,337,I failed him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,338,No man could have protected him from himself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,339,"I wonder, Ser Barristan,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,340,who gave the king this wine?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,341,"His squire, from the king's own skin."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,342,His squire? The Lannister boy?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,343,Such a dutiful boy to make sure His Grace
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,344,did not lack refreshment.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,345,I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,346,His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,347,Whatever arrangements you made...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,348,unmake them. At once.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,349,I'm afraid those birds have flown.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,350,The girl is likely dead already.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,351,The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,352,According to the prophecy...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,353,...the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,354,The earth ends at the black salt sea.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,355,No horse can cross the poison water.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,356,The earth does not end at the sea...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,357,...there are many dirts beyond the sea.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,358,The dirt where I was born.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,359,Not dirts. Lands.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,360,"Lands, yes..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,361,There are thousands of ships in the free cities.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,362,Wooden horses that fly across the sea...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,363,Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,364,It's not a chair. It's a...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,365,... throne.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,366,Throne.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,367,"A chair for a King to sit upon,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,368,or...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,369,...a Queen.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,370,A King does not need a chair to sit upon.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,371,He only needs a horse.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,372,Can't you help me make him understand?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,373,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,374,"Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,375,"My brother was a fool, I know,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,376,but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,377,"Have I said something funny, ser?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,378,"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,379,didn't seize six of the Kingdoms because they were his right.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,380,He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,381,And because he had dragons.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,382,"Ah, well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,383,"- You don't believe it. - Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,384,I believe what my eyes and ears report.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,385,As for the rest... it was 300 years ago.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,386,Who knows what really happened?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,387,"Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant captain,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,388,see if he has any letters for me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,389,"- I'll come with you. - No, no, don't trouble yourself."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,390,Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,391,Psst! Jorah the Andal.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,392,The Spider sends his greetings
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,393,and his congratulations.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,394,A royal pardon. You can go home now.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,395,Sweet reds...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,396,"I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,397,Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,398,I have them! I have them!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,399,A taste for the Khaleesi?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,400,"I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,401,One taste and you'll name your first child after me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,402,"My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,403,Just a taste.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,404,"My lady, you are from Westeros."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,405,"You have the honour of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,406,Khaleesi of the Riding Men and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,407,- Princess. - Rise.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,408,I'd still like to taste that wine.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,409,That? Dornish swill.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,410,Not worthy of a princess.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,411,I have a dry red from the Arbor -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,412,nectar of the gods.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,413,Let me give you a cask. A... A gift.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,414,"You honour me, ser."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,415,The honour... the honour is all mine.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,416,Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,417,"You know, there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, Princess."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,418,I hope to repay your kindness someday.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,419,Rakharo.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,420,Put down that cask.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,421,- Is something wrong? - I have a thirst.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,422,Open it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,423,The wine is for the khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,424,Open it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,425,Pour.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,426,It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,427,- without at least giving it time to breathe. - Do as he says.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,428,As the princess commands.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,429,"Sweet, isn't it?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,430,"Can you smell the fruit, ser?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,431,"Taste it, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,432,Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,433,You first.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,434,Me?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,435,I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,436,"Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,437,You will drink.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,438,Stop him!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,439,Come.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,440,You came to us as outlaws...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,441,"...poachers, rapers,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,442,"killers, thieves."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,443,"You came alone, in chains,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,444,without friends
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,445,or honour.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,446,You came to us rich and you came to us poor.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,447,Some of you bear the names
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,448,"of proud Houses,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,449,others only bastard names or no names at all.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,450,It does not matter.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,451,All that is in the past.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,452,Here...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,453,on the Wall...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,454,we are all one House.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,455,- Tonight... - You're allowed to look happy.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,456,You're going to be a ranger.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,457,Isn't that what you always wanted?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,458,I want to find my uncle.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,459,I know he's alive out there. I know he is.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,460,"I wish I could help you, but I'm no ranger."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,461,It's the steward's life for me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,462,There's honour in being a steward.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,463,"Not much, really."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,464,But there's food.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,465,Here... you begin anew.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,466,A man of the Night's Watch...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,467,lives his life for the realm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,468,Not for a king...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,469,"or a lord, or the honour of this House"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,470,"or that House,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,471,"not for gold or glory,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,472,"or a woman's love,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,473,but for the realm
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,474,and all the people in it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,475,You've all learned the words of the vow.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,476,Think carefully before you say them.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,477,The penalty for desertion...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,478,is death.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,479,You can take your vows here...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,480,tonight...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,481,at sunset.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,482,Do any of you still keep the old gods?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,483,"I do, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,484,You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,485,"Yes, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,486,You'll find a weirwood a mile north of the Wall.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,487,"And your old gods too, maybe."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,488,"My lord, might I go as well?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,489,Does House Tarly keep the old gods?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,490,"No, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,491,"I was named in the light of the Seven,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,492,as my father was and his father before him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,493,Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,494,The Night's Watch is my House now.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,495,The Seven have never answered my prayers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,496,Perhaps the old gods will.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,497,"As you wish, lad."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,498,"You've all been assigned an order,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,499,according to our needs
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,500,and your strengths.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,501,Halder to the builders.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,502,Pyp to the stewards.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,503,Toad to the builders. Grenn to the rangers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,504,Samwell to the stewards.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,505,Matthar to the rangers. Dareon to the stewards.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,506,Balian to the rangers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,507,Rast to the rangers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,508,Jon to the stewards.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,509,Rancer to the builder.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,510,Echiel to the builders. Gordo to the stewards.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,511,Niko to the rangers. Escan to the rangers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,512,Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,513,Mink to the kitchens. Allo to the builders.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,514,Nelugo to the rangers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,515,May all the gods preserve you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,516,Rangers with me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,517,Builders!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,518,"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,519,"Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,520,"Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe in the stables."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,521,"Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,522,Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,523,Make no comment about his nose.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,524,"Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,525,has requested you for his personal steward.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,526,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,527,"Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,528,change his sheets and blankets daily
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,529,and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,530,Do you take me for a servant?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,531,We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,532,But perhaps we were wrong in that.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,533,- May I go? - As you wish.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,534,"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,535,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,536,He wanted it and he got it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,537,Stewards are nothing but maids!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,538,I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,539,- It's not fair. - Fair?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,540,I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,541,when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,542,I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,543,So now I'm here - at the end of the world
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,544,with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,545,I'll never see my family again.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,546,I'll never be inside a woman again.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,547,So don't tell me about fair.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,548,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,549,Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,550,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,551,Now listen to me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,552,The old man is the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,553,You'll be with him day and night.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,554,"Yes, you'll clean his clothes."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,555,"But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,556,squire for him in battle.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,557,"You'll know everything, be part of everything."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,558,And he asked for you himself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,559,He wants to groom you for command.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,560,I just...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,561,I always wanted to be a ranger.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,562,I always wanted to be a wizard.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,563,What?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,564,"No, I'm serious."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,565,So you'll stay and say your words with me?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,566,Lord Stark... a moment.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,567,"Alone, if you will."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,568,He named you Protector of the Realm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,569,He did.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,570,She won't care.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,571,Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,572,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,573,"Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,574,We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,575,"Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,576,Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,577,"By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,578,What about Stannis?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,579,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,580,You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,581,Stannis is your older brother.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,582,This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,583,That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,584,What's best for the Kingdoms?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,585,What's best for the people we rule?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,586,We all know what Stannis is.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,587,He inspires no love or loyalty.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,588,He's not a king.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,589,I am.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,590,Stannis is a commander.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,591,He's led men into war twice.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,592,He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,593,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,594,Tell me something.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,595,Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,596,I will not dishonour Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,597,and dragging frightened children from their beds.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,598,You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,599,You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,600,Not his steward...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,601,not his captain of the guard...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,602,and not his wife.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,603,Only Stannis himself.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,604,"Yes, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,605,Now leave us.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,606,My Lord Protector.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,607,The king has no trueborn sons.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,608,Joffrey and Tommen...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,609,are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,610,- So when the king dies... - The throne passes to his brother...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,611,Lord Stannis.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,612,So it would seem.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,613,"- Unless... - There is no ""unless""."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,614,He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,615,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,616,You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,617,Do you have a shred of honour?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,618,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,619,All of the power is yours. You need only...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,620,reach out and take it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,621,Make peace with the Lannisters.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,622,Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,623,"We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,624,"and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,625,we simply reveal his little secret
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,626,- and seat Lord Renly there instead. - We?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,627,"You'll need someone to share these burdens, I assure you."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,628,My price would be modest.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,629,What you suggest is treason.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,630,Only if we lose.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,631,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,632,with the people who tried to murder my boy.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,633,"We only make peace with our enemies, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,634,"That's why it's called ""making peace""."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,635,No. I won't do it.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,636,So it will be Stannis and war?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,637,There is no other choice.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,638,He is the heir.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,639,So why did you call me here?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,640,"Not for my wisdom, clearly."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,641,You promised Catelyn you would help me.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,642,The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms -
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,643,enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,644,I need the gold cloaks.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,645,"The City Watch is 2,000 strong..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,646,and sworn to defend the king's peace.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,647,Look at you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,648,"You know what you want me to do,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,649,"you know it has to be done,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,650,"but it's not honourable, so..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,651,the words stick in your throat.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,652,When the queen proclaims one king
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,653,"and the Hand proclaims another,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,654,whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,655,Who do they follow?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,656,The man who pays them.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,657,Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,658,Night gathers and now my watch begins.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,659,It shall not end until my death.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,660,"I shall take no wife,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,661,"hold no lands, father no children."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,662,I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,663,I shall live and die at my post.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,664,I am the sword in the darkness.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,665,I am the watcher on the walls.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,666,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,667,"I pledge my life and honour to the Night's Watch,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,668,for this night and all the nights to come.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,669,You knelt as boys.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,670,Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,671,Well done. Well done.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,672,What's he got there?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,673,"To me, Ghost. Bring it here."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,674,Gods be good!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,675,What will they do to him?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,676,"When the khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,677,and forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,678,And when he falls?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,679,I saw a man last nine miles once.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,680,King Robert still wants me dead.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,681,This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,682,I thought he'd leave me alone now that my brother is gone.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,683,He will never leave you alone.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,684,"If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,685,"If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,686,his spies would tell him.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,687,He will never abandon the hunt.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,688,You're a Targaryen - the last Targaryen.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,689,Your son will have Targaryen blood
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,690,"with 40,000 riders behind him."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,691,He will not have my son.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,692,"He will not have you either, Khaleesi."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,693,Moon of my life.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,694,Are you hurt?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,695,"Jorah the Andal,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,696,I heard what you did.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,697,"Choose any horse you wish, it is yours."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,698,I make this gift to you.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,699,"And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,700,I will also pledge a gift.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,701,I will give him the iron chair...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,702,...that his mother's father sat upon.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,703,I will give him Seven Kingdoms.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,704,"I, Drogo, will do this."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,705,I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,706,...and ride wooden horses across the black salt water...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,707,...as no Khal has done before.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,708,I will kill the men in iron suits...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,709,...and tear down their stone houses.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,710,I will rape their women...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,711,...take their children as slaves...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,712,...and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,713,"This, I vow..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,714,"...I, Drogo, son of Bharbo."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,715,I swear before the Mother of Mountains...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,716,...as the stars look down in witness.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,717,As the stars look down in witness.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,718,Lord Stark!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,719,"- Stop! -  No, all right."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,720,It's all right. Let him through.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,721,"Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,722,King Joffrey?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,723,King Robert is gone.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,724,The gods give him rest.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,725,All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,726,Good.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,727,Is Lord Renly joining us?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,728,I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,729,He rode through the Old Gate an hour before dawn
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,730,with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,731,Last seen galloping south in some haste.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,732,"We stand behind you, Lord Stark."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,733,"All hail His Grace,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,734,"Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,735,"the First of His Name,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,736,"King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,737,Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,738,and Protector of the Realm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,739,I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,740,I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,741,Today I shall accept oaths of fealty
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,742,from my loyal councillors.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,743,Ser Barristan...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,744,I believe no man here could ever question your honour.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,745,King Robert's seal - unbroken.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,746,"""Lord Eddard Stark is herein named..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,747,"""Protector of the Realm..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,748,"""to rule as regent..."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,749,"""until the heir come of age."""
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,750,"May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,751,Protector of the Realm.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,752,"Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?"
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,753,A piece of paper?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,754,- Those were the king's words. - We have a new king now.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,755,"Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,756,Allow me to return the courtesy.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,757,"Bend the knee, my lord."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,758,Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son...
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,759,and we shall allow you to live out your days
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,760,in the grey waste you call home.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,761,Your son has no claim to the throne.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,762,Liar!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,763,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,764,"Ser Barristan, seize this traitor."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,765,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,766,You think he stands alone?
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,767,Kill him! Kill all of them! I command it!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,768,Commander! Take the queen and her children into custody.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,769,"Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard."
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,770,Men of the Watch!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,771,I want no bloodshed.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,772,Tell your men to lay down their swords.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,773,No one needs to die.
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,774,Now!
S01E07,You Win Or You Die,775,I did warn you not to trust me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,1,"Yah! Left high, left low."
S01E08,The Pointy End,2,"Right low, lunge right."
S01E08,The Pointy End,3,"You break anything, the septa will have my head."
S01E08,The Pointy End,4,What is...
S01E08,The Pointy End,5,Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
S01E08,The Pointy End,6,- How she could forget... - She didn't forget.
S01E08,The Pointy End,7,She's with her dancing master. She's with him every morning.
S01E08,The Pointy End,8,She always comes back with scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.
S01E08,The Pointy End,9,Hush!
S01E08,The Pointy End,10,Go back to your room.
S01E08,The Pointy End,11,Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
S01E08,The Pointy End,12,- What is it? What's happening? - Do as I told you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,13,Run!
S01E08,The Pointy End,14,This way!
S01E08,The Pointy End,15,"Left, right. Rah!"
S01E08,The Pointy End,16,"- Now you are dead. - You said right,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,17,but you went left.
S01E08,The Pointy End,18,- And now you are a dead girl. - Only 'cause you lied.
S01E08,The Pointy End,19,My tongue lied. My eyes shouted the truth.
S01E08,The Pointy End,20,"- You were not seeing. - I was so. I watched, but you..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,21,"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
S01E08,The Pointy End,22,"The seeing, the true seeing,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,23,that is the heart of swordplay.
S01E08,The Pointy End,24,"Arya Stark, come with us. Your father wants to see you."
S01E08,The Pointy End,25,And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men
S01E08,The Pointy End,26,in place of his own?
S01E08,The Pointy End,27,"- I am wondering. - Mind your place, dancing master."
S01E08,The Pointy End,28,- This is no concern of yours. - My father wouldn't send you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,29,And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
S01E08,The Pointy End,30,Take her.
S01E08,The Pointy End,31,"Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,32,"Get out of my way, little man."
S01E08,The Pointy End,33,I am Syrio Forel...
S01E08,The Pointy End,34,Foreign bastard.
S01E08,The Pointy End,35,...and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
S01E08,The Pointy End,36,Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
S01E08,The Pointy End,37,"Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day."
S01E08,The Pointy End,38,Run to your father.
S01E08,The Pointy End,39,Bloody oafs.
S01E08,The Pointy End,40,"- Begone now, Arya. - Come with me. Run."
S01E08,The Pointy End,41,The first sword of Braavos does not run.
S01E08,The Pointy End,42,What do we say
S01E08,The Pointy End,43,to the god of death?
S01E08,The Pointy End,44,Not today.
S01E08,The Pointy End,45,Go.
S01E08,The Pointy End,46,Not today. Not today.
S01E08,The Pointy End,47,Stay away from me. I'll tell my father.
S01E08,The Pointy End,48,I'll... I'll tell the queen.
S01E08,The Pointy End,49,Who do you think sent me?
S01E08,The Pointy End,50,Needle.
S01E08,The Pointy End,51,There she is.
S01E08,The Pointy End,52,"- What do you want? - I want you, wolf girl."
S01E08,The Pointy End,53,- Come here. - Leave me be.
S01E08,The Pointy End,54,- My father's a lord. He'll reward you. - She'll reward me - the queen!
S01E08,The Pointy End,55,Stay away!
S01E08,The Pointy End,56,"Lord Stark, you must be thirsty."
S01E08,The Pointy End,57,Varys.
S01E08,The Pointy End,58,I promise you it isn't poisoned.
S01E08,The Pointy End,59,Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
S01E08,The Pointy End,60,"Not so much, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,61,"I would save the rest, if I were you."
S01E08,The Pointy End,62,Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
S01E08,The Pointy End,63,What about my daughters?
S01E08,The Pointy End,64,The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
S01E08,The Pointy End,65,Even my little birds cannot find her.
S01E08,The Pointy End,66,- And Sansa? - Still engaged to Joffrey.
S01E08,The Pointy End,67,Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though...
S01E08,The Pointy End,68,"all dead, it grieves me to say. I do so hate the sight of blood."
S01E08,The Pointy End,69,You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
S01E08,The Pointy End,70,"And would again, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,71,"I was unarmed, unarmoured and surrounded by Lannister swords."
S01E08,The Pointy End,72,When you look at me do you see a hero?
S01E08,The Pointy End,73,What madness led you to tell the queen
S01E08,The Pointy End,74,you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
S01E08,The Pointy End,75,The madness of mercy.
S01E08,The Pointy End,76,"- That she might save her children. - Ah, the children."
S01E08,The Pointy End,77,It's always the innocents who suffer.
S01E08,The Pointy End,78,"It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar."
S01E08,The Pointy End,79,"The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,80,but it was your mercy that killed the king.
S01E08,The Pointy End,81,"I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,82,The queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
S01E08,The Pointy End,83,"The wrong brother, sadly. And lost to her."
S01E08,The Pointy End,84,Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
S01E08,The Pointy End,85,"If that's true,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,86,then slit my throat and be done with it.
S01E08,The Pointy End,87,"Not today, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,88,"Tell me something, Varys."
S01E08,The Pointy End,89,Who do you truly serve?
S01E08,The Pointy End,90,"The realm, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,91,Someone must.
S01E08,The Pointy End,92,"It's Othor, without a doubt."
S01E08,The Pointy End,93,"The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off."
S01E08,The Pointy End,94,Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
S01E08,The Pointy End,95,"Just these two, my lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
S01E08,The Pointy End,96,- Mmm. - The smell.
S01E08,The Pointy End,97,What smell?
S01E08,The Pointy End,98,There is none.
S01E08,The Pointy End,99,"If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,100,"- We should burn them. - Snow's not wrong, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,101,Fire will do for them. The wildling way.
S01E08,The Pointy End,102,I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
S01E08,The Pointy End,103,"You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid."
S01E08,The Pointy End,104,- Get them inside. - You heard him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,105,"Lord Commander,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,106,Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
S01E08,The Pointy End,107,A raven from King's Landing.
S01E08,The Pointy End,108,"Come on, move 'em out."
S01E08,The Pointy End,109,"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,110,and pour one for yourself.
S01E08,The Pointy End,111,The king is dead.
S01E08,The Pointy End,112,Is there any word of my father?
S01E08,The Pointy End,113,Sit.
S01E08,The Pointy End,114,Lord Stark has been
S01E08,The Pointy End,115,charged with treason.
S01E08,The Pointy End,116,They say he conspired with Robert's brothers
S01E08,The Pointy End,117,to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
S01E08,The Pointy End,118,I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
S01E08,The Pointy End,119,Your duty lies here now.
S01E08,The Pointy End,120,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
S01E08,The Pointy End,121,I'm sure they'll be
S01E08,The Pointy End,122,treated gently.
S01E08,The Pointy End,123,"Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear."
S01E08,The Pointy End,124,King Robert's body was still warm
S01E08,The Pointy End,125,when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
S01E08,The Pointy End,126,He wouldn't do that.
S01E08,The Pointy End,127,He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.
S01E08,The Pointy End,128,"Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake."
S01E08,The Pointy End,129,Send for my father. He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
S01E08,The Pointy End,130,"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that."
S01E08,The Pointy End,131,Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
S01E08,The Pointy End,132,How can I allow you to marry my son?
S01E08,The Pointy End,133,A child born of a traitor's seed
S01E08,The Pointy End,134,is no fit consort for our king.
S01E08,The Pointy End,135,"She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,136,but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
S01E08,The Pointy End,137,"No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see."
S01E08,The Pointy End,138,"I'll be a queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything."
S01E08,The Pointy End,139,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
S01E08,The Pointy End,140,She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
S01E08,The Pointy End,141,"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,142,- what's his name? - Robb.
S01E08,The Pointy End,143,"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
S01E08,The Pointy End,144,"Best it comes from you. If you would help your father,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,145,urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
S01E08,The Pointy End,146,Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
S01E08,The Pointy End,147,"If... If I could see my father, talk to him about..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,148,"You disappoint me, child."
S01E08,The Pointy End,149,We have told you of your father's treason.
S01E08,The Pointy End,150,Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
S01E08,The Pointy End,151,I only meant that...
S01E08,The Pointy End,152,What will happen to him?
S01E08,The Pointy End,153,- That depends. - On...
S01E08,The Pointy End,154,- On what? - On your brother.
S01E08,The Pointy End,155,And on you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,156,Treason?
S01E08,The Pointy End,157,Sansa wrote this?
S01E08,The Pointy End,158,"It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words."
S01E08,The Pointy End,159,You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
S01E08,The Pointy End,160,"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,161,"This is a royal command, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,162,- If you should refuse to obey... - I won't refuse.
S01E08,The Pointy End,163,"His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing."
S01E08,The Pointy End,164,But not alone.
S01E08,The Pointy End,165,Call the banners.
S01E08,The Pointy End,166,"All of them, my lord?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,167,"They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,168,They have.
S01E08,The Pointy End,169,Now we see what their words are worth.
S01E08,The Pointy End,170,Yes.
S01E08,The Pointy End,171,Are you afraid?
S01E08,The Pointy End,172,I must be.
S01E08,The Pointy End,173,Good.
S01E08,The Pointy End,174,- Why is that good? - It means you're not stupid.
S01E08,The Pointy End,175,You've had this since dawn?
S01E08,The Pointy End,176,"He sent it to me, not you."
S01E08,The Pointy End,177,- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy. - A courtesy?!
S01E08,The Pointy End,178,My husband has been taken prisoner.
S01E08,The Pointy End,179,- My son intends to declare war. - A war?
S01E08,The Pointy End,180,Your son against the Lannisters?
S01E08,The Pointy End,181,You should go to him. Teach him patience.
S01E08,The Pointy End,182,Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
S01E08,The Pointy End,183,He is your brother by law!
S01E08,The Pointy End,184,Does family mean nothing to you?
S01E08,The Pointy End,185,Family means everything to me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,186,And I will not risk Robin's life
S01E08,The Pointy End,187,to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
S01E08,The Pointy End,188,"- I'm hungry. - Hush now, darling."
S01E08,The Pointy End,189,You just ate.
S01E08,The Pointy End,190,"You will not support us, then? Do I understand you correctly?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,191,"- But I'm hungry! - Soon, love, soon."
S01E08,The Pointy End,192,"You're always welcome here, sister."
S01E08,The Pointy End,193,But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
S01E08,The Pointy End,194,That is what I ask.
S01E08,The Pointy End,195,"Go on, sweet."
S01E08,The Pointy End,196,Time for your bath.
S01E08,The Pointy End,197,I'll feed you after.
S01E08,The Pointy End,198,If you fear for the safety of your son...
S01E08,The Pointy End,199,Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
S01E08,The Pointy End,200,Are you an idiot?
S01E08,The Pointy End,201,They killed my husband.
S01E08,The Pointy End,202,You say they shoved your boy from a window.
S01E08,The Pointy End,203,- These people will do anything. - And that is why we have to stop them.
S01E08,The Pointy End,204,The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale
S01E08,The Pointy End,205,"where they belong,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,206,to protect their lord.
S01E08,The Pointy End,207,Will you shut up?
S01E08,The Pointy End,208,There's hill tribes all around here.
S01E08,The Pointy End,209,"If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart."
S01E08,The Pointy End,210,I should just take your food and leave you here.
S01E08,The Pointy End,211,Eh?
S01E08,The Pointy End,212,"- What would you do then? - Starve, most likely."
S01E08,The Pointy End,213,"You don't think I'd do it, do you?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,214,"What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,215,Golden women?
S01E08,The Pointy End,216,"Stick with me and you'll have them all,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,217,for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
S01E08,The Pointy End,218,But you knew that.
S01E08,The Pointy End,219,That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honour.
S01E08,The Pointy End,220,Fair enough.
S01E08,The Pointy End,221,But don't go looking for me to bend the knee
S01E08,The Pointy End,222,"and ""my lord"" you every time you take a shit."
S01E08,The Pointy End,223,I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
S01E08,The Pointy End,224,"Though I would treasure your friendship,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,225,I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
S01E08,The Pointy End,226,"And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,227,remember this -
S01E08,The Pointy End,228,"whatever their price,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,229,I'll beat it.
S01E08,The Pointy End,230,I like living.
S01E08,The Pointy End,231,Tyrion.
S01E08,The Pointy End,232,Tyrion.
S01E08,The Pointy End,233,Tyrion.
S01E08,The Pointy End,234,"Come, share our fire."
S01E08,The Pointy End,235,Help yourselves to our goat.
S01E08,The Pointy End,236,"When you meet your gods, you tell them"
S01E08,The Pointy End,237,"Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you."
S01E08,The Pointy End,238,"I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister."
S01E08,The Pointy End,239,"How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,240,"In my own bed, at the age of 80"
S01E08,The Pointy End,241,with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
S01E08,The Pointy End,242,Take the halfman.
S01E08,The Pointy End,243,He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.
S01E08,The Pointy End,244,"No, no, no, no, no!"
S01E08,The Pointy End,245,My... My house is rich and powerful.
S01E08,The Pointy End,246,"If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold."
S01E08,The Pointy End,247,We have no use for a halfman's promises.
S01E08,The Pointy End,248,"Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies."
S01E08,The Pointy End,249,What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver
S01E08,The Pointy End,250,when the knights of the Vale ride by?
S01E08,The Pointy End,251,Are those the best weapons you could steal?
S01E08,The Pointy End,252,"Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back."
S01E08,The Pointy End,253,Lannister smiths shit better steel.
S01E08,The Pointy End,254,You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
S01E08,The Pointy End,255,That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
S01E08,The Pointy End,256,"But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,257,I will not give you trinkets.
S01E08,The Pointy End,258,I will give you this.
S01E08,The Pointy End,259,"What is ""this""?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,260,The Vale of Arryn.
S01E08,The Pointy End,261,The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
S01E08,The Pointy End,262,The lords of the Vale want me dead.
S01E08,The Pointy End,263,I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
S01E08,The Pointy End,264,Now there's a rare sight...
S01E08,The Pointy End,265,"Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard."
S01E08,The Pointy End,266,"- Jon, no! - Jon, stop, put it down!"
S01E08,The Pointy End,267,Blood will always tell.
S01E08,The Pointy End,268,"You'll hang for this, bastard."
S01E08,The Pointy End,269,I told you not to do anything stupid.
S01E08,The Pointy End,270,You're confined to quarters. Go.
S01E08,The Pointy End,271,"Ghost, what's wrong?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,272,Is someone out there?
S01E08,The Pointy End,273,Commander?
S01E08,The Pointy End,274,Stay.
S01E08,The Pointy End,275,Hello?
S01E08,The Pointy End,276,Who's there?
S01E08,The Pointy End,277,Lord Commander?
S01E08,The Pointy End,278,Snow?
S01E08,The Pointy End,279,Commander!
S01E08,The Pointy End,280,Move!
S01E08,The Pointy End,281,What did they do?
S01E08,The Pointy End,282,Lamb men make good slaves.
S01E08,The Pointy End,283,"Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,284,and the slavers will give us gold...
S01E08,The Pointy End,285,"...and silk, and steel."
S01E08,The Pointy End,286,I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
S01E08,The Pointy End,287,"Gold to hire ships, Princess,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,288,ships to sail to Westeros.
S01E08,The Pointy End,289,"Jorah, make them stop."
S01E08,The Pointy End,290,- Khaleesi? - You heard me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,291,These men have shed blood for their khal. Now they claim their rewards.
S01E08,The Pointy End,292,"She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi."
S01E08,The Pointy End,293,The riders do her honour.
S01E08,The Pointy End,294,"If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,295,I will bring you her tongue.
S01E08,The Pointy End,296,"Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been."
S01E08,The Pointy End,297,"I do not have a gentle heart, ser."
S01E08,The Pointy End,298,Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
S01E08,The Pointy End,299,Come.
S01E08,The Pointy End,300,- What do you want done with them? - Bring her to me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,301,And those women there.
S01E08,The Pointy End,302,"You cannot claim them all, Princess."
S01E08,The Pointy End,303,"I can,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,304,and I will.
S01E08,The Pointy End,305,"Moon of my life,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,306,"Mago says you haven taken his spoils,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,307,a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
S01E08,The Pointy End,308,Tell me the truth of this.
S01E08,The Pointy End,309,"Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars."
S01E08,The Pointy End,310,I have claimed many daughters this day...
S01E08,The Pointy End,311,...so they cannot be mounted.
S01E08,The Pointy End,312,This is the way of war.
S01E08,The Pointy End,313,These women are slaves now...
S01E08,The Pointy End,314,...to do with as we please.
S01E08,The Pointy End,315,It pleases me to keep them safe.
S01E08,The Pointy End,316,"If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives."
S01E08,The Pointy End,317,Does the horse mate with the lamb?
S01E08,The Pointy End,318,The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
S01E08,The Pointy End,319,You are a foreigner.
S01E08,The Pointy End,320,You do not command me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,321,I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,322,See how fierce she grows?
S01E08,The Pointy End,323,"That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,324,filling her with his fire.
S01E08,The Pointy End,325,I will hear no more.
S01E08,The Pointy End,326,"Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock."
S01E08,The Pointy End,327,A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
S01E08,The Pointy End,328,I will not have your body burned.
S01E08,The Pointy End,329,I will not give you that honour.
S01E08,The Pointy End,330,The beetles will feed on your eyes.
S01E08,The Pointy End,331,The worms will crawl through your lungs.
S01E08,The Pointy End,332,The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
S01E08,The Pointy End,333,...until nothing is left of you but bones.
S01E08,The Pointy End,334,First you have to kill me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,335,I already have.
S01E08,The Pointy End,336,My sun and stars is wounded.
S01E08,The Pointy End,337,A scratch...
S01E08,The Pointy End,338,...moon of my life.
S01E08,The Pointy End,339,Where are the healers?
S01E08,The Pointy End,340,This is the bite of a fly.
S01E08,The Pointy End,341,I can help the great rider with his cut.
S01E08,The Pointy End,342,The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
S01E08,The Pointy End,343,She is mine. Let her speak.
S01E08,The Pointy End,344,"Thank you, silver lady."
S01E08,The Pointy End,345,Who are you?
S01E08,The Pointy End,346,I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the godswife of this temple.
S01E08,The Pointy End,347,Witch.
S01E08,The Pointy End,348,My mother was godswife here before me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,349,She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
S01E08,The Pointy End,350,"All men are of one flock, so my people believe."
S01E08,The Pointy End,351,The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
S01E08,The Pointy End,352,Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
S01E08,The Pointy End,353,"Lamb or lion,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,354,his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
S01E08,The Pointy End,355,"Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,356,...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
S01E08,The Pointy End,357,"For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy."
S01E08,The Pointy End,358,I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
S01E08,The Pointy End,359,Galbart Glover will lead the van.
S01E08,The Pointy End,360,The bloody wall will melt
S01E08,The Pointy End,361,before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
S01E08,The Pointy End,362,I will lead the van or I will take my men
S01E08,The Pointy End,363,and march them home.
S01E08,The Pointy End,364,"You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber."
S01E08,The Pointy End,365,"And when I am done with the Lannisters,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,366,"I will march back north, root you out of your keep"
S01E08,The Pointy End,367,and hang you for an oathbreaker.
S01E08,The Pointy End,368,"Oathbreaker, is it?!"
S01E08,The Pointy End,369,I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
S01E08,The Pointy End,370,My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel
S01E08,The Pointy End,371,against your liege lord.
S01E08,The Pointy End,372,But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,373,Your meat...
S01E08,The Pointy End,374,is bloody tough.
S01E08,The Pointy End,375,"- What is it? What's happened? - Shh, it's all right."
S01E08,The Pointy End,376,- Where are you going? - South. For Father.
S01E08,The Pointy End,377,- But it's the middle of the night. - The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
S01E08,The Pointy End,378,I don't want them to know we're coming.
S01E08,The Pointy End,379,"- They have more men than we do. - Aye, they do."
S01E08,The Pointy End,380,Can't I come with you? I can ride now.
S01E08,The Pointy End,381,"You've seen me riding. And I won't get in the way, I..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,382,There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
S01E08,The Pointy End,383,Until I return that will be you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,384,You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand?
S01E08,The Pointy End,385,Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.
S01E08,The Pointy End,386,"- I will. - I'll send letters whenever I can,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,387,"but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared."
S01E08,The Pointy End,388,Until I return.
S01E08,The Pointy End,389,How long have you been hiding out there?
S01E08,The Pointy End,390,Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
S01E08,The Pointy End,391,- They've all gone away. - They'll be back soon.
S01E08,The Pointy End,392,Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
S01E08,The Pointy End,393,"No, they won't."
S01E08,The Pointy End,394,Please watch over Robb.
S01E08,The Pointy End,395,And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
S01E08,The Pointy End,396,"And Theon too, I suppose."
S01E08,The Pointy End,397,"You hear them, boy?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,398,The old gods are answering you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,399,- What are you doing here? - They're my gods too.
S01E08,The Pointy End,400,"Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods."
S01E08,The Pointy End,401,- Even slaves are allowed to pray. - You're not a slave.
S01E08,The Pointy End,402,"Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat."
S01E08,The Pointy End,403,"I'm not complaining, little lord,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,404,just telling truths.
S01E08,The Pointy End,405,What did you mean about hearing the gods?
S01E08,The Pointy End,406,"You asked them, they're answering you."
S01E08,The Pointy End,407,Shh.
S01E08,The Pointy End,408,Open your ears.
S01E08,The Pointy End,409,It's only the wind.
S01E08,The Pointy End,410,Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
S01E08,The Pointy End,411,"They see you, boy."
S01E08,The Pointy End,412,They hear you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,413,Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
S01E08,The Pointy End,414,The old gods have no power in the South.
S01E08,The Pointy End,415,The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
S01E08,The Pointy End,416,How can they watch when they have no eyes?
S01E08,The Pointy End,417,"Well, there's a big man."
S01E08,The Pointy End,418,He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
S01E08,The Pointy End,419,"Go back and find your clothes, Hodor."
S01E08,The Pointy End,420,- Go dress. - Hodor.
S01E08,The Pointy End,421,Are there really giants beyond the wall?
S01E08,The Pointy End,422,Giants and worse than giants.
S01E08,The Pointy End,423,"I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way."
S01E08,The Pointy End,424,"All these swords, they should be going north, boy."
S01E08,The Pointy End,425,"North, not south!"
S01E08,The Pointy End,426,The cold winds are rising.
S01E08,The Pointy End,427,They were touched by white walkers.
S01E08,The Pointy End,428,That's why they came back.
S01E08,The Pointy End,429,That's why their eyes turned blue.
S01E08,The Pointy End,430,Only fire will stop them.
S01E08,The Pointy End,431,- How do you know that? - I read about it in a book...
S01E08,The Pointy End,432,a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
S01E08,The Pointy End,433,- What else did the book say? - The white walkers
S01E08,The Pointy End,434,sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
S01E08,The Pointy End,435,And when they wake up...
S01E08,The Pointy End,436,"And when they wake up, what?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,437,I hope the Wall's high enough.
S01E08,The Pointy End,438,"Summer snows, my lady."
S01E08,The Pointy End,439,Robb's brought the North with him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,440,The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
S01E08,The Pointy End,441,And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
S01E08,The Pointy End,442,Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
S01E08,The Pointy End,443,"One army or two, the kings in the North"
S01E08,The Pointy End,444,threw back hosts 10 times as large.
S01E08,The Pointy End,445,Mother!
S01E08,The Pointy End,446,You look well.
S01E08,The Pointy End,447,"Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times."
S01E08,The Pointy End,448,"We had thought not to meet you here, my lady."
S01E08,The Pointy End,449,I had not thought to be here.
S01E08,The Pointy End,450,I would speak with my son alone.
S01E08,The Pointy End,451,"I know you will forgive me, my lords."
S01E08,The Pointy End,452,You heard her! Move your arses!
S01E08,The Pointy End,453,"Come on, out."
S01E08,The Pointy End,454,"You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,455,"Have no fear, my lady."
S01E08,The Pointy End,456,We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole
S01E08,The Pointy End,457,and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
S01E08,The Pointy End,458,"- You old devil, Rodrik. - Jon."
S01E08,The Pointy End,459,"You're not wasting away, are you?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,460,"I remember the day you came into this world,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,461,red-faced and squalling.
S01E08,The Pointy End,462,And now I find you leading a host to war.
S01E08,The Pointy End,463,- There was no one else. - No one?
S01E08,The Pointy End,464,Who were those men I saw here?
S01E08,The Pointy End,465,- None of them are Starks. - All of them are seasoned in battle.
S01E08,The Pointy End,466,If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
S01E08,The Pointy End,467,"Oh, would that I could."
S01E08,The Pointy End,468,There was...
S01E08,The Pointy End,469,a letter.
S01E08,The Pointy End,470,From Sansa.
S01E08,The Pointy End,471,"From the queen, you mean."
S01E08,The Pointy End,472,- There's no mention of Arya. - No.
S01E08,The Pointy End,473,How many men do you have?
S01E08,The Pointy End,474,"18,000."
S01E08,The Pointy End,475,If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
S01E08,The Pointy End,476,You would never be allowed to leave. No.
S01E08,The Pointy End,477,"Our best hope, our only hope,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,478,- is that you can defeat them in the field. - And if I lose?
S01E08,The Pointy End,479,Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
S01E08,The Pointy End,480,- when the Mad King fell? - They were butchered in their sleep.
S01E08,The Pointy End,481,On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
S01E08,The Pointy End,482,And the years have not made him kinder.
S01E08,The Pointy End,483,"If you lose,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,484,"your father dies, your sisters die,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,485,we die.
S01E08,The Pointy End,486,"Well, that makes it simple, then."
S01E08,The Pointy End,487,I suppose it does.
S01E08,The Pointy End,488,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
S01E08,The Pointy End,489,"Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin."
S01E08,The Pointy End,490,Not best for me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,491,"If the halfman betrays us,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,492,"Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,493,"And feed it to the goats, yes."
S01E08,The Pointy End,494,"All right, then."
S01E08,The Pointy End,495,Time to meet my father.
S01E08,The Pointy End,496,- Tyrion. - Uncle.
S01E08,The Pointy End,497,Father.
S01E08,The Pointy End,498,The rumours of your demise were unfounded.
S01E08,The Pointy End,499,Sorry to disappoint you.
S01E08,The Pointy End,500,And who are these...
S01E08,The Pointy End,501,companions of yours?
S01E08,The Pointy End,502,"This is Shagga, son of Dolf,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,503,chieftain of the Stone Crows.
S01E08,The Pointy End,504,"Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men."
S01E08,The Pointy End,505,"This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,506,leader of the Black Ears.
S01E08,The Pointy End,507,"And here we have Bronn, son of..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,508,You wouldn't know him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,509,"May I present my lord father,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,510,"Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,511,Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
S01E08,The Pointy End,512,Kind of you to go to war for me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,513,You left us no choice.
S01E08,The Pointy End,514,The honour of the house was at stake.
S01E08,The Pointy End,515,Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
S01E08,The Pointy End,516,"We have our differences, Jaime and I."
S01E08,The Pointy End,517,He's braver. I'm better-looking.
S01E08,The Pointy End,518,He's been covering himself in glory.
S01E08,The Pointy End,519,"Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,520,"and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland."
S01E08,The Pointy End,521,- And the Starks? Lord Eddard? - Is our hostage.
S01E08,The Pointy End,522,He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
S01E08,The Pointy End,523,How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
S01E08,The Pointy End,524,Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
S01E08,The Pointy End,525,"My sister rules, you mean."
S01E08,The Pointy End,526,Stark's son has called his banners.
S01E08,The Pointy End,527,- He moves south with a strong host. - A green boy.
S01E08,The Pointy End,528,One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
S01E08,The Pointy End,529,Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
S01E08,The Pointy End,530,You'd like him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,531,"While we're on the subject of war,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,532,"I made promises to my friends here,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,533,and a Lannister always pays his debts.
S01E08,The Pointy End,534,"We shall require 3,000 helms and shields,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,535,"plus swords, pikes,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,536,"gorgets, maces..."
S01E08,The Pointy End,537,"If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report"
S01E08,The Pointy End,538,that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
S01E08,The Pointy End,539,The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws. So be it.
S01E08,The Pointy End,540,"Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly."
S01E08,The Pointy End,541,And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
S01E08,The Pointy End,542,"At once, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,543,It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
S01E08,The Pointy End,544,Ride with me against my enemies
S01E08,The Pointy End,545,and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
S01E08,The Pointy End,546,Only if the halfman fights with us.
S01E08,The Pointy End,547,"Until we hold the steel he pledged us,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,548,the little lion's life is ours.
S01E08,The Pointy End,549,The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
S01E08,The Pointy End,550,"We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage."
S01E08,The Pointy End,551,"No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun."
S01E08,The Pointy End,552,Do that and the river lords will join us.
S01E08,The Pointy End,553,To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
S01E08,The Pointy End,554,Lord Frey controls that bridge. Your father's bannerman.
S01E08,The Pointy End,555,"""The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him."
S01E08,The Pointy End,556,"At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done."
S01E08,The Pointy End,557,Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
S01E08,The Pointy End,558,Robb's right. We need that bridge.
S01E08,The Pointy End,559,So what's it going to be?
S01E08,The Pointy End,560,Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
S01E08,The Pointy End,561,"Your pardon, my lords. We've captured a Lannister scout."
S01E08,The Pointy End,562,"Don't worry, lad. He won't be leaving this tent with his head."
S01E08,The Pointy End,563,- Where did you find him? - In the brush above the encampment.
S01E08,The Pointy End,564,He looked to be counting.
S01E08,The Pointy End,565,How high did you get?
S01E08,The Pointy End,566,"20,000. Maybe more."
S01E08,The Pointy End,567,You don't have to do this yourself. Your father would understand...
S01E08,The Pointy End,568,"My father understands mercy, when there is room for it."
S01E08,The Pointy End,569,And he understands honour...
S01E08,The Pointy End,570,and courage.
S01E08,The Pointy End,571,Let him go.
S01E08,The Pointy End,572,Robb.
S01E08,The Pointy End,573,Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,574,"20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold."
S01E08,The Pointy End,575,"Yes, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,576,"Thank you, my lord."
S01E08,The Pointy End,577,"Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,578,You call me boy again.
S01E08,The Pointy End,579,Go on.
S01E08,The Pointy End,580,Oi.
S01E08,The Pointy End,581,It is also the wish of His Grace
S01E08,The Pointy End,582,"that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,583,- Commander of the City Watch... - Ser Aron.
S01E08,The Pointy End,584,...be at once raised to the rank of lord...
S01E08,The Pointy End,585,Lord Gyles.
S01E08,The Pointy End,586,"...and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,587,and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honour
S01E08,The Pointy End,588,after him until the end of time.
S01E08,The Pointy End,589,"In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,590,"it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,591,"Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,592,be appointed Hand of the King.
S01E08,The Pointy End,593,"Lastly,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,594,"in these times of treason and turmoil,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,595,it is the view of council
S01E08,The Pointy End,596,that the life and safety
S01E08,The Pointy End,597,of King Joffrey
S01E08,The Pointy End,598,be of paramount importance.
S01E08,The Pointy End,599,Ser Barristan Selmy.
S01E08,The Pointy End,600,"Your Grace, I am yours to command."
S01E08,The Pointy End,601,"Rise, Ser Barristan."
S01E08,The Pointy End,602,You may remove your helm.
S01E08,The Pointy End,603,You have served the realm long and faithfully.
S01E08,The Pointy End,604,Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
S01E08,The Pointy End,605,But it is time to put aside your armour and your sword.
S01E08,The Pointy End,606,It is time to rest and look back with pride
S01E08,The Pointy End,607,on your many years of service.
S01E08,The Pointy End,608,"Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood."
S01E08,The Pointy End,609,Our vows are taken for life. Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
S01E08,The Pointy End,610,"Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your king's?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,611,You let my father die.
S01E08,The Pointy End,612,You're too old to protect anybody.
S01E08,The Pointy End,613,- Your Grace... - The council has determined
S01E08,The Pointy End,614,that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
S01E08,The Pointy End,615,- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. - The man who profaned his blade
S01E08,The Pointy End,616,with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
S01E08,The Pointy End,617,"Careful, ser."
S01E08,The Pointy End,618,"We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser."
S01E08,The Pointy End,619,"You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,620,with servants to look after your every need.
S01E08,The Pointy End,621,A hall to die in and men to bury me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,622,I am a knight.
S01E08,The Pointy End,623,I shall die a knight.
S01E08,The Pointy End,624,"A naked knight, apparently."
S01E08,The Pointy End,625,Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
S01E08,The Pointy End,626,"Here, boy!"
S01E08,The Pointy End,627,Melt it down and add it to the others.
S01E08,The Pointy End,628,If any man in this hall has other matters
S01E08,The Pointy End,629,"to set before His Grace, let him speak now"
S01E08,The Pointy End,630,or go forth and hold his silence.
S01E08,The Pointy End,631,Your Grace.
S01E08,The Pointy End,632,"Come forward, my lady."
S01E08,The Pointy End,633,The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
S01E08,The Pointy End,634,"Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?"
S01E08,The Pointy End,635,I do.
S01E08,The Pointy End,636,"As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,637,"Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King."
S01E08,The Pointy End,638,Treason is a noxious weed.
S01E08,The Pointy End,639,"- It should be torn out, root... - Let her speak."
S01E08,The Pointy End,640,I want to hear what she says.
S01E08,The Pointy End,641,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S01E08,The Pointy End,642,Do you deny your father's crime?
S01E08,The Pointy End,643,"No, my lords. I know he must be punished."
S01E08,The Pointy End,644,All I ask is mercy.
S01E08,The Pointy End,645,I know my lord father must regret what he did.
S01E08,The Pointy End,646,He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,647,You all know he loved him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,648,He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,649,They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
S01E08,The Pointy End,650,They must have lied!
S01E08,The Pointy End,651,He said I wasn't the king.
S01E08,The Pointy End,652,- Why did he say that? - He was badly hurt.
S01E08,The Pointy End,653,Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
S01E08,The Pointy End,654,He wasn't himself. Otherwise he never would have said it.
S01E08,The Pointy End,655,A child's faith.
S01E08,The Pointy End,656,Such sweet innocence.
S01E08,The Pointy End,657,And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
S01E08,The Pointy End,658,Treason is treason!
S01E08,The Pointy End,659,Anything else?
S01E08,The Pointy End,660,"If you still have any affection in your heart for me,"
S01E08,The Pointy End,661,"please do me this kindness, Your Grace."
S01E08,The Pointy End,662,Your sweet words have moved me.
S01E08,The Pointy End,663,But your father has to confess.
S01E08,The Pointy End,664,He has to confess and say that I'm the king...
S01E08,The Pointy End,665,or there'll be no mercy for him.
S01E08,The Pointy End,666,He will.
S01E09,Baelor,1,"You've seen better days, my lord."
S01E09,Baelor,2,Another visit?
S01E09,Baelor,3,It seems you're my last friend.
S01E09,Baelor,4,"No, no, many still love you."
S01E09,Baelor,5,Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
S01E09,Baelor,6,On her knees begging for me. Hm!
S01E09,Baelor,7,Did you laugh with the others?
S01E09,Baelor,8,"You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing I want."
S01E09,Baelor,9,I don't know what you want.
S01E09,Baelor,10,I've given up trying to guess.
S01E09,Baelor,11,When I was still a boy -
S01E09,Baelor,12,before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -
S01E09,Baelor,13,I travelled with a group of actors through the free cities.
S01E09,Baelor,14,They taught me that each man has a role to play.
S01E09,Baelor,15,The same is true at court.
S01E09,Baelor,16,I am the master of whisperers.
S01E09,Baelor,17,"My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples."
S01E09,Baelor,18,"I'm a good actor, my lord."
S01E09,Baelor,19,Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
S01E09,Baelor,20,I could.
S01E09,Baelor,21,But will I?
S01E09,Baelor,22,No.
S01E09,Baelor,23,"As I said, I'm no hero."
S01E09,Baelor,24,What do you want? Tell me.
S01E09,Baelor,25,"No riddles, no stories... Tell me, what do you want?"
S01E09,Baelor,26,Peace.
S01E09,Baelor,27,Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.
S01E09,Baelor,28,Fighting for his father's freedom.
S01E09,Baelor,29,Robb?
S01E09,Baelor,30,He's just a boy.
S01E09,Baelor,31,Boys have been conquerors before.
S01E09,Baelor,32,But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's... the late king's brother.
S01E09,Baelor,33,Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.
S01E09,Baelor,34,He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
S01E09,Baelor,35,Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
S01E09,Baelor,36,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. It would be a shame to throw it away.
S01E09,Baelor,37,Cersei is no fool.
S01E09,Baelor,38,She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
S01E09,Baelor,39,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men,"
S01E09,Baelor,40,who crippled my son?
S01E09,Baelor,41,I want you to serve the realm!
S01E09,Baelor,42,"Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason,"
S01E09,Baelor,43,tell your son to lay down his sword
S01E09,Baelor,44,and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.
S01E09,Baelor,45,Cersei knows you as a man of honour.
S01E09,Baelor,46,"If you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave,"
S01E09,Baelor,47,I believe she will allow you to take the black
S01E09,Baelor,48,and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
S01E09,Baelor,49,You think my life is some precious thing to me?
S01E09,Baelor,50,That I would trade my honour for a few more years of...
S01E09,Baelor,51,Of what?
S01E09,Baelor,52,You grew up with actors.
S01E09,Baelor,53,You learned their craft and you learnt it well.
S01E09,Baelor,54,But I grew up with soldiers.
S01E09,Baelor,55,I learned how to die a long time ago.
S01E09,Baelor,56,Pity.
S01E09,Baelor,57,Such a pity.
S01E09,Baelor,58,"What of your daughter's life, my lord?"
S01E09,Baelor,59,Is that a precious thing to you?
S01E09,Baelor,60,It's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
S01E09,Baelor,61,- Or so Walder Frey would have you think. -  Keep shooting them down.
S01E09,Baelor,62,We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
S01E09,Baelor,63,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
S01E09,Baelor,64,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised.
S01E09,Baelor,65,Look.
S01E09,Baelor,66,Father rots in a dungeon.
S01E09,Baelor,67,How long before they take his head?
S01E09,Baelor,68,We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
S01E09,Baelor,69,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing.
S01E09,Baelor,70,We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
S01E09,Baelor,71,Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
S01E09,Baelor,72,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years,"
S01E09,Baelor,73,and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
S01E09,Baelor,74,Have my horse saddled and ready.
S01E09,Baelor,75,Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
S01E09,Baelor,76,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
S01E09,Baelor,77,My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing.
S01E09,Baelor,78,Whatever it took.
S01E09,Baelor,79,"If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
S01E09,Baelor,80,I agree.
S01E09,Baelor,81,- I'll go. -  You can't!
S01E09,Baelor,82,I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl. He would never harm me.
S01E09,Baelor,83,Unless there was a profit in it.
S01E09,Baelor,84,What do you want?
S01E09,Baelor,85,"It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
S01E09,Baelor,86,"Oh, spare me."
S01E09,Baelor,87,Your boy's too proud to come before me himself.
S01E09,Baelor,88,What am I supposed to do with you?
S01E09,Baelor,89,"Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here..."
S01E09,Baelor,90,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead to you?"
S01E09,Baelor,91,"- Father, please... - I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?"
S01E09,Baelor,92,Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.
S01E09,Baelor,93,"All right, you come forward."
S01E09,Baelor,94,"There. Now that I've observed the courtesies,"
S01E09,Baelor,95,perhaps my sons will do me the honour of shutting their mouths.
S01E09,Baelor,96,Is there somewhere we can talk?
S01E09,Baelor,97,We're talking right now.
S01E09,Baelor,98,Fine.
S01E09,Baelor,99,Out! All of you!
S01E09,Baelor,100,- Oh! - You too.
S01E09,Baelor,101,You see that?
S01E09,Baelor,102,"Fifteen, she is."
S01E09,Baelor,103,A little flower.
S01E09,Baelor,104,And her honey's all mine.
S01E09,Baelor,105,I'm sure she will give you many sons.
S01E09,Baelor,106,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
S01E09,Baelor,107,"He is quite ill, my lord."
S01E09,Baelor,108,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either."
S01E09,Baelor,109,Or the one before that.
S01E09,Baelor,110,Your family has always pissed on me.
S01E09,Baelor,111,"- My lord, I... - Don't deny it. You know it's true."
S01E09,Baelor,112,The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
S01E09,Baelor,113,- I'm sure there were reasons... - I didn't need reasons.
S01E09,Baelor,114,I needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up?
S01E09,Baelor,115,Why are you here?
S01E09,Baelor,116,To ask you...
S01E09,Baelor,117,"to open your gates, my lord..."
S01E09,Baelor,118,so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
S01E09,Baelor,119,"- Why should I let him? - If you could climb your own battlements,"
S01E09,Baelor,120,"you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
S01E09,Baelor,121,"They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here."
S01E09,Baelor,122,"Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark."
S01E09,Baelor,123,Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep
S01E09,Baelor,124,and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
S01E09,Baelor,125,You swore an oath to my father.
S01E09,Baelor,126,"Oh, yes, I said some words."
S01E09,Baelor,127,"And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right."
S01E09,Baelor,128,"Joffrey's king now,"
S01E09,Baelor,129,"which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me."
S01E09,Baelor,130,"If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
S01E09,Baelor,131,"- Why don't you? - Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon."
S01E09,Baelor,132,Give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?
S01E09,Baelor,133,And... engage!
S01E09,Baelor,134,When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
S01E09,Baelor,135,"- Soon, he says. - Good."
S01E09,Baelor,136,"You'll be ready for this, then."
S01E09,Baelor,137,I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear...
S01E09,Baelor,138,so I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw.
S01E09,Baelor,139,"Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think."
S01E09,Baelor,140,This is Valyrian steel.
S01E09,Baelor,141,"It was my father's sword, his father before him."
S01E09,Baelor,142,The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.
S01E09,Baelor,143,It was meant for my son Jorah.
S01E09,Baelor,144,"He brought dishonour to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword"
S01E09,Baelor,145,before he fled from Westeros.
S01E09,Baelor,146,"- My lord, you honour me, but I can't... - Oh, you can."
S01E09,Baelor,147,And you will.
S01E09,Baelor,148,I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast.
S01E09,Baelor,149,A bloody dead man tried to kill me.
S01E09,Baelor,150,So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it.
S01E09,Baelor,151,"- Is that understood? - Yes, my lord."
S01E09,Baelor,152,Right.
S01E09,Baelor,153,"Now, don't think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne."
S01E09,Baelor,154,That's a man's sword. It'll take a man to wield it.
S01E09,Baelor,155,I'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.
S01E09,Baelor,156,"No, you won't. I sent him to King's Landing yesterday."
S01E09,Baelor,157,The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist...
S01E09,Baelor,158,"I've, uh, ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this..."
S01E09,Baelor,159,boy king.
S01E09,Baelor,160,That should get young Joffrey's attention.
S01E09,Baelor,161,"And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne."
S01E09,Baelor,162,Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...
S01E09,Baelor,163,and bring me my supper.
S01E09,Baelor,164,"Yes, my lord."
S01E09,Baelor,165,- Well done. - Well done.
S01E09,Baelor,166,"You earned that, Snow."
S01E09,Baelor,167,Well done.
S01E09,Baelor,168,"Go on, let's have a look."
S01E09,Baelor,169,- At what? -  The sword! Show us the sword.
S01E09,Baelor,170,Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
S01E09,Baelor,171,Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
S01E09,Baelor,172,- Let's have a look. - Piss off.
S01E09,Baelor,173,"Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light."
S01E09,Baelor,174,Give it here!
S01E09,Baelor,175,What is it?
S01E09,Baelor,176,- I... - Look at its eyes.
S01E09,Baelor,177,- Give it. - I can't.
S01E09,Baelor,178,You can't what?
S01E09,Baelor,179,I...
S01E09,Baelor,180,I'm really not supposed to say.
S01E09,Baelor,181,And yet you really want to say.
S01E09,Baelor,182,You want to say that?
S01E09,Baelor,183,There was a raven.
S01E09,Baelor,184,I read the message to Maester Aemon.
S01E09,Baelor,185,It's your brother Robb.
S01E09,Baelor,186,What?
S01E09,Baelor,187,What about him?
S01E09,Baelor,188,He's heading south.
S01E09,Baelor,189,To war.
S01E09,Baelor,190,All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.
S01E09,Baelor,191,I should be there.
S01E09,Baelor,192,I should be with him.
S01E09,Baelor,193,"If we do that, they'll never get back across."
S01E09,Baelor,194,Well?
S01E09,Baelor,195,What did he say?
S01E09,Baelor,196,Lord Walder has granted your crossing.
S01E09,Baelor,197,"- His men are yours, as well. -  Huh."
S01E09,Baelor,198,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
S01E09,Baelor,199,What does he want in return?
S01E09,Baelor,200,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.
S01E09,Baelor,201,"- He expects a knighthood in good time. - Fine, fine."
S01E09,Baelor,202,And?
S01E09,Baelor,203,And Arya...
S01E09,Baelor,204,will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
S01E09,Baelor,205,- She won't be happy about that. - Hm.
S01E09,Baelor,206,And?
S01E09,Baelor,207,And...
S01E09,Baelor,208,when the fighting is done...
S01E09,Baelor,209,you will marry one of his daughters.
S01E09,Baelor,210,Whichever you prefer.
S01E09,Baelor,211,He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.
S01E09,Baelor,212,I see.
S01E09,Baelor,213,Did you get a look at his daughters?
S01E09,Baelor,214,I did.
S01E09,Baelor,215,And?
S01E09,Baelor,216,One was...
S01E09,Baelor,217,Do you consent?
S01E09,Baelor,218,- Can I refuse? - Not if you want to cross.
S01E09,Baelor,219,Then I consent.
S01E09,Baelor,220,Sam said you wanted to see me?
S01E09,Baelor,221,I did indeed.
S01E09,Baelor,222,Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.
S01E09,Baelor,223,"Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch"
S01E09,Baelor,224,take no wives and father no children?
S01E09,Baelor,225,No.
S01E09,Baelor,226,So they will not love.
S01E09,Baelor,227,Love is the death of duty.
S01E09,Baelor,228,If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose...
S01E09,Baelor,229,between honour on the one hand...
S01E09,Baelor,230,"and those he loves on the other,"
S01E09,Baelor,231,what would he do?
S01E09,Baelor,232,He... He would do whatever was right. No matter what.
S01E09,Baelor,233,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000."
S01E09,Baelor,234,Most of us are not so strong.
S01E09,Baelor,235,What is honour...
S01E09,Baelor,236,compared to a woman's love?
S01E09,Baelor,237,And what is duty...
S01E09,Baelor,238,against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?
S01E09,Baelor,239,Or a brother's smile?
S01E09,Baelor,240,Sam told you.
S01E09,Baelor,241,We're all human.
S01E09,Baelor,242,"Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it."
S01E09,Baelor,243,Honour comes easy then.
S01E09,Baelor,244,Yet...
S01E09,Baelor,245,sooner or later...
S01E09,Baelor,246,in every man's life...
S01E09,Baelor,247,there comes a day when it is not easy.
S01E09,Baelor,248,A day when he must choose.
S01E09,Baelor,249,And this is my day?
S01E09,Baelor,250,Is that what you're saying?
S01E09,Baelor,251,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes."
S01E09,Baelor,252,- I know. - You do not know.
S01E09,Baelor,253,No one knows.
S01E09,Baelor,254,"I may be a bastard,"
S01E09,Baelor,255,but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
S01E09,Baelor,256,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows.
S01E09,Baelor,257,They waited till I was old.
S01E09,Baelor,258,What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South...
S01E09,Baelor,259,"the ruin of my House, the death of my family?"
S01E09,Baelor,260,I was helpless...
S01E09,Baelor,261,"blind, frail."
S01E09,Baelor,262,But...
S01E09,Baelor,263,when I heard they had killed my brother's son...
S01E09,Baelor,264,and his poor son...
S01E09,Baelor,265,and the children!
S01E09,Baelor,266,Even the little children.
S01E09,Baelor,267,Who are you?
S01E09,Baelor,268,"My father was Maekar,"
S01E09,Baelor,269,the first of his name.
S01E09,Baelor,270,My brother Aegon reigned after him...
S01E09,Baelor,271,when I had refused the throne.
S01E09,Baelor,272,And he was followed by his son Aerys...
S01E09,Baelor,273,whom they called the Mad King.
S01E09,Baelor,274,You're Aemon Targaryen.
S01E09,Baelor,275,"I'm a maester of the Citadel,"
S01E09,Baelor,276,bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch.
S01E09,Baelor,277,I will not tell you... to stay or go.
S01E09,Baelor,278,You must make that choice yourself...
S01E09,Baelor,279,and live with it for the rest of your days.
S01E09,Baelor,280,As I have.
S01E09,Baelor,281,My lord...
S01E09,Baelor,282,My sun and stars...
S01E09,Baelor,283,Drogo.
S01E09,Baelor,284,My horse...
S01E09,Baelor,285,Blood of my blood...
S01E09,Baelor,286,"No, I must ride."
S01E09,Baelor,287,He fell from his horse.
S01E09,Baelor,288,A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
S01E09,Baelor,289,"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest."
S01E09,Baelor,290,We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.
S01E09,Baelor,291,This is no place to camp.
S01E09,Baelor,292,A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
S01E09,Baelor,293,We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
S01E09,Baelor,294,You do not command me Khaleesi.
S01E09,Baelor,295,Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
S01E09,Baelor,296,"The witch? I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
S01E09,Baelor,297,Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
S01E09,Baelor,298,Hyah! Hyah!
S01E09,Baelor,299,Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins
S01E09,Baelor,300,with Lord Frey's levies in tow.
S01E09,Baelor,301,They're a day's march north.
S01E09,Baelor,302,"The boy may lack experience and sense,"
S01E09,Baelor,303,but he does have a certain mindless...
S01E09,Baelor,304,- provincial courage. - Ah.
S01E09,Baelor,305,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
S01E09,Baelor,306,"I do hope your savages are going to be of some use,"
S01E09,Baelor,307,otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
S01E09,Baelor,308,The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes.
S01E09,Baelor,309,"Heavy black steel, double-sided."
S01E09,Baelor,310,Shagga likes axes.
S01E09,Baelor,311,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
S01E09,Baelor,312,- The vanguard? - Mm-hm.
S01E09,Baelor,313,Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
S01E09,Baelor,314,They do seem rather ferocious.
S01E09,Baelor,315,Ferocious?
S01E09,Baelor,316,Last night... a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.
S01E09,Baelor,317,Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat.
S01E09,Baelor,318,"Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock,"
S01E09,Baelor,319,"which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money,"
S01E09,Baelor,320,which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
S01E09,Baelor,321,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
S01E09,Baelor,322,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
S01E09,Baelor,323,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
S01E09,Baelor,324,It appears I'm not hungry after all.
S01E09,Baelor,325,"Excuse me, my lords."
S01E09,Baelor,326,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
S01E09,Baelor,327,- I took her. - Took her?
S01E09,Baelor,328,"- From whom? - From, uh..."
S01E09,Baelor,329,Ser... What's his name?
S01E09,Baelor,330,"- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down. - And he didn't have anything to say about it?"
S01E09,Baelor,331,He said something.
S01E09,Baelor,332,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically."
S01E09,Baelor,333,We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
S01E09,Baelor,334,"Oh, well."
S01E09,Baelor,335,"I, uh... think I'll go and find myself one."
S01E09,Baelor,336,Who are you?
S01E09,Baelor,337,Who would you like me to be?
S01E09,Baelor,338,What did your mother call you?
S01E09,Baelor,339,Shae. What did your mother call you?
S01E09,Baelor,340,My mother died giving birth to me.
S01E09,Baelor,341,Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
S01E09,Baelor,342,- What sort of accent is that? - Foreign.
S01E09,Baelor,343,For...
S01E09,Baelor,344,What do you want from me?
S01E09,Baelor,345,What do I want from you?
S01E09,Baelor,346,I want you to share my tent.
S01E09,Baelor,347,"I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes,"
S01E09,Baelor,348,rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride.
S01E09,Baelor,349,I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together.
S01E09,Baelor,350,And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.
S01E09,Baelor,351,Which it may well be.
S01E09,Baelor,352,And what do I get?
S01E09,Baelor,353,One - safety.
S01E09,Baelor,354,No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine.
S01E09,Baelor,355,"Two - the pleasure of my company,"
S01E09,Baelor,356,which I have heard is spectacular.
S01E09,Baelor,357,Who told you this? Women you paid?
S01E09,Baelor,358,And three...
S01E09,Baelor,359,more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years.
S01E09,Baelor,360,Do you accept my proposal?
S01E09,Baelor,361,Let's start with your last night in this world.
S01E09,Baelor,362,Khaleesi.
S01E09,Baelor,363,Come.
S01E09,Baelor,364,He's very strong.
S01E09,Baelor,365,No one understands how strong he is.
S01E09,Baelor,366,"- He will die tonight, Khaleesi. - He can't."
S01E09,Baelor,367,He can't. I won't let him.
S01E09,Baelor,368,Even a queen doesn't have that power.
S01E09,Baelor,369,We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
S01E09,Baelor,370,"- I won't leave him. - He's already gone, Khaleesi."
S01E09,Baelor,371,Doth...
S01E09,Baelor,372,Even if...
S01E09,Baelor,373,Even if he dies...
S01E09,Baelor,374,why would I run?
S01E09,Baelor,375,"I am khaleesi, and my... my son will be khal after Drogo."
S01E09,Baelor,376,"This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood."
S01E09,Baelor,377,Here they only honour strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies.
S01E09,Baelor,378,Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.
S01E09,Baelor,379,He won't want any rivals.
S01E09,Baelor,380,Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
S01E09,Baelor,381,I won't... leave him.
S01E09,Baelor,382,The wound has festered.
S01E09,Baelor,383,You did this witch.
S01E09,Baelor,384,Stop it!
S01E09,Baelor,385,I don't want her hurt.
S01E09,Baelor,386,No? No? You don't want her hurt?
S01E09,Baelor,387,"Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
S01E09,Baelor,388,Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
S01E09,Baelor,389,Only while the blood of my blood lives.
S01E09,Baelor,390,"When he dies, she is nothing."
S01E09,Baelor,391,I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon.
S01E09,Baelor,392,"The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
S01E09,Baelor,393,"I think you should wear your armour tonight, ser."
S01E09,Baelor,394,I think you're right.
S01E09,Baelor,395,- You've saved me once more. - And now you must save him.
S01E09,Baelor,396,He's beyond the healer's skills.
S01E09,Baelor,397,All I can do is ease his path.
S01E09,Baelor,398,Save him and I will free you. I swear it.
S01E09,Baelor,399,You must know a way.
S01E09,Baelor,400,Some...
S01E09,Baelor,401,Some magic.
S01E09,Baelor,402,There is a spell.
S01E09,Baelor,403,Some would say death is cleaner.
S01E09,Baelor,404,Do it.
S01E09,Baelor,405,Save him.
S01E09,Baelor,406,"- There is a price. - You'll have gold, whatever you want."
S01E09,Baelor,407,It's not a matter of gold. This is bloodmagic.
S01E09,Baelor,408,Only death pays for life.
S01E09,Baelor,409,My death?
S01E09,Baelor,410,"No, not your death, Khaleesi."
S01E09,Baelor,411,Bring me his horse.
S01E09,Baelor,412,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing."
S01E09,Baelor,413,- Let me kill this witch. - Kill her and you kill your khal.
S01E09,Baelor,414,This is bloodmagic. It is forbidden.
S01E09,Baelor,415,I am your khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.
S01E09,Baelor,416,Go. Now.
S01E09,Baelor,417,- Take her and leave. - Uh-uh.
S01E09,Baelor,418,Take her!
S01E09,Baelor,419,"You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent."
S01E09,Baelor,420,The dead will dance here tonight.
S01E09,Baelor,421,No one will enter.
S01E09,Baelor,422,Bring him back to me.
S01E09,Baelor,423,What have you done?
S01E09,Baelor,424,I have to save him.
S01E09,Baelor,425,"We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai."
S01E09,Baelor,426,You would have been safe.
S01E09,Baelor,427,This must not be.
S01E09,Baelor,428,This must be.
S01E09,Baelor,429,Witch.
S01E09,Baelor,430,"No, you can't."
S01E09,Baelor,431,Khaleesi!
S01E09,Baelor,432,"No further, horselord."
S01E09,Baelor,433,Are you hurt?
S01E09,Baelor,434,- The baby... - Hmm?
S01E09,Baelor,435,...is coming.
S01E09,Baelor,436,- Fetch the midwives. - They will not come. They say she is cursed.
S01E09,Baelor,437,They'll come or I'll have their heads.
S01E09,Baelor,438,The witch - she can bring baby. I hear her say so.
S01E09,Baelor,439,"Are you in agony, my lion?"
S01E09,Baelor,440,- No. - You look like you're in agony.
S01E09,Baelor,441,The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
S01E09,Baelor,442,Ah!
S01E09,Baelor,443,"Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
S01E09,Baelor,444,- Just used to it. - Drink.
S01E09,Baelor,445,Let's play a new game.
S01E09,Baelor,446,There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you.
S01E09,Baelor,447,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
S01E09,Baelor,448,- Not if you win. - No!
S01E09,Baelor,449,"No fire games, no knife games."
S01E09,Baelor,450,- Let's do something I'm good at. - What are you good at?
S01E09,Baelor,451,I happen to be a great judge of character.
S01E09,Baelor,452,- This sounds like a boring game. - It's not.
S01E09,Baelor,453,Here's how it works - I make a statement about your past.
S01E09,Baelor,454,"If I'm right, you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink."
S01E09,Baelor,455,And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.
S01E09,Baelor,456,I don't want to play this game.
S01E09,Baelor,457,Fine. Bronn first.
S01E09,Baelor,458,Your father beat you.
S01E09,Baelor,459,But my mother hit harder.
S01E09,Baelor,460,You killed your first man before you were 12.
S01E09,Baelor,461,It was a woman.
S01E09,Baelor,462,She swung an axe at me.
S01E09,Baelor,463,You've been north of the Wall.
S01E09,Baelor,464,What brought you up there?
S01E09,Baelor,465,- Work. - And...
S01E09,Baelor,466,"you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly"
S01E09,Baelor,467,so you've never let yourself love again.
S01E09,Baelor,468,"Oh, wait, that's me."
S01E09,Baelor,469,"Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
S01E09,Baelor,470,I don't want to play.
S01E09,Baelor,471,It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.
S01E09,Baelor,472,Your mother was a whore.
S01E09,Baelor,473,Drink.
S01E09,Baelor,474,All right.
S01E09,Baelor,475,"Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
S01E09,Baelor,476,Drink.
S01E09,Baelor,477,- And we've established the rules about lying? - Drink!
S01E09,Baelor,478,Mm.
S01E09,Baelor,479,You wanted a different life.
S01E09,Baelor,480,You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
S01E09,Baelor,481,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
S01E09,Baelor,482,"So, specifics..."
S01E09,Baelor,483,"You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?"
S01E09,Baelor,484,I don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you.
S01E09,Baelor,485,So... what's a lowborn girl to do?
S01E09,Baelor,486,Drink.
S01E09,Baelor,487,- Are you sure... - Drink!
S01E09,Baelor,488,"And don't talk about my mother and father ever,"
S01E09,Baelor,489,or I will carve your eyes from your head.
S01E09,Baelor,490,"My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologise."
S01E09,Baelor,491,My turn.
S01E09,Baelor,492,"Fine, fine."
S01E09,Baelor,493,Ask away.
S01E09,Baelor,494,Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
S01E09,Baelor,495,- Who were you in love with? - That's not how the game works.
S01E09,Baelor,496,I don't care the way the game works.
S01E09,Baelor,497,Our lord here used to be married.
S01E09,Baelor,498,- Married? - How did you hear that?
S01E09,Baelor,499,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
S01E09,Baelor,500,"Another night, perhaps."
S01E09,Baelor,501,Not another night. This night.
S01E09,Baelor,502,It's not a pleasant story.
S01E09,Baelor,503,"Oh, maybe I will cry."
S01E09,Baelor,504,I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
S01E09,Baelor,505,So...
S01E09,Baelor,506,"I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding, when we heard a scream."
S01E09,Baelor,507,"She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels."
S01E09,Baelor,508,"Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak."
S01E09,Baelor,509,"She was too scared to send off on her own,"
S01E09,Baelor,510,so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.
S01E09,Baelor,511,Her name was Tysha.
S01E09,Baelor,512,She was a wheelwright's orphan.
S01E09,Baelor,513,And she was hungry.
S01E09,Baelor,514,Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.
S01E09,Baelor,515,"Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine."
S01E09,Baelor,516,I forgot how afraid I was around girls...
S01E09,Baelor,517,how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or...
S01E09,Baelor,518,"look away embarrassed,"
S01E09,Baelor,519,"or ask me about my tall, handsome brother."
S01E09,Baelor,520,I forgot about everything but Tysha.
S01E09,Baelor,521,And somehow I found myself in her bed.
S01E09,Baelor,522,"For three chickens, I should hope so."
S01E09,Baelor,523,It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
S01E09,Baelor,524,But she was good to me.
S01E09,Baelor,525,She kissed me afterwards and...
S01E09,Baelor,526,sang me a song.
S01E09,Baelor,527,And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.
S01E09,Baelor,528,"A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon"
S01E09,Baelor,529,and there you have it - man and wife.
S01E09,Baelor,530,"For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
S01E09,Baelor,531,"Well, I imagine that was the end of all that."
S01E09,Baelor,532,Not quite.
S01E09,Baelor,533,"First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth."
S01E09,Baelor,534,"The girl was a whore, you see."
S01E09,Baelor,535,"Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers... all of it."
S01E09,Baelor,536,He thought it was time I had a woman.
S01E09,Baelor,537,After my brother confessed...
S01E09,Baelor,538,my father brought in my wife
S01E09,Baelor,539,and gave her to his guards.
S01E09,Baelor,540,He paid her well - a silver for each man.
S01E09,Baelor,541,How many whores command that kind of price?
S01E09,Baelor,542,He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.
S01E09,Baelor,543,"By the end, she had so much silver"
S01E09,Baelor,544,that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.
S01E09,Baelor,545,I would have killed the man who did that to me.
S01E09,Baelor,546,You should have known she was a whore.
S01E09,Baelor,547,Really?
S01E09,Baelor,548,"I was 16, drunk and in love."
S01E09,Baelor,549,A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
S01E09,Baelor,550,"As I said, I was young and stupid."
S01E09,Baelor,551,You are still young and stupid.
S01E09,Baelor,552,Hyah!
S01E09,Baelor,553,- What is it? What do you want? - You're sleeping through the war.
S01E09,Baelor,554,- What? - They stole a night's march on us.
S01E09,Baelor,555,They're a mile north.
S01E09,Baelor,556,- Get my squire! - You don't have a squire.
S01E09,Baelor,557,"If I die, weep for me."
S01E09,Baelor,558,You'll be dead. How will you know?
S01E09,Baelor,559,I'll know.
S01E09,Baelor,560,Watch out! Move!
S01E09,Baelor,561,Out of the way!
S01E09,Baelor,562,Move aside!
S01E09,Baelor,563,Stay low.
S01E09,Baelor,564,Stay low?
S01E09,Baelor,565,"If you're lucky, no one will notice you."
S01E09,Baelor,566,I was born lucky.
S01E09,Baelor,567,"Tribesmen of the Vale,"
S01E09,Baelor,568,gather round!
S01E09,Baelor,569,Stone Crows!
S01E09,Baelor,570,Black Ears! Burned Men!
S01E09,Baelor,571,- Moon Brothers! -  And Painted Dogs!
S01E09,Baelor,572,- And Painted Dogs! -  Painted Dogs!
S01E09,Baelor,573,Your dominion over the Vale begins now!
S01E09,Baelor,574,"Onward, to claim what is yours!"
S01E09,Baelor,575,Half man! Half man!
S01E09,Baelor,576,Half man! Half man!
S01E09,Baelor,577,Half man! Half man!
S01E09,Baelor,578,To battle!
S01E09,Baelor,579,You're a shit warrior.
S01E09,Baelor,580,I'm alive?
S01E09,Baelor,581,You're alive.
S01E09,Baelor,582,Did we win?
S01E09,Baelor,583,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
S01E09,Baelor,584,How did our tribesmen do?
S01E09,Baelor,585,"Yeah, good."
S01E09,Baelor,586,- It's nice to see them getting along. -  You're wounded.
S01E09,Baelor,587,Good of you to notice.
S01E09,Baelor,588,I hear we won.
S01E09,Baelor,589,Huh! The scouts were wrong.
S01E09,Baelor,590,"There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20."
S01E09,Baelor,591,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
S01E09,Baelor,592,He wasn't here.
S01E09,Baelor,593,Where was he?
S01E09,Baelor,594,"With his other 18,000 men."
S01E09,Baelor,595,And where are they?
S01E09,Baelor,596,"- We should go, my lady. - No!"
S01E09,Baelor,597,My lady!
S01E09,Baelor,598,Hyah! Hyah!
S01E09,Baelor,599,"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
S01E09,Baelor,600,"Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it."
S01E09,Baelor,601,It is not your sword I want.
S01E09,Baelor,602,Give me my daughters back.
S01E09,Baelor,603,Give me my husband.
S01E09,Baelor,604,"I've lost them too, I'm afraid."
S01E09,Baelor,605,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father."
S01E09,Baelor,606,- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him. - He's more use to us alive than dead.
S01E09,Baelor,607,Take him away and put him in irons.
S01E09,Baelor,608,"We could end this war right now, boy,"
S01E09,Baelor,609,save thousands of lives.
S01E09,Baelor,610,"You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters."
S01E09,Baelor,611,"Swords or lances, teeth, nails -"
S01E09,Baelor,612,choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
S01E09,Baelor,613,"If we do it your way, kingslayer..."
S01E09,Baelor,614,you'd win.
S01E09,Baelor,615,We're not doing it your way.
S01E09,Baelor,616,"Come on, pretty man."
S01E09,Baelor,617,"- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today. - The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice."
S01E09,Baelor,618,Aye. But the dead won't hear them.
S01E09,Baelor,619,One victory does not make us conquerors.
S01E09,Baelor,620,Did we free my father?
S01E09,Baelor,621,Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?
S01E09,Baelor,622,Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees?
S01E09,Baelor,623,This war is far from over.
S01E09,Baelor,624,Could I have one?
S01E09,Baelor,625,A lemon one... or any of them.
S01E09,Baelor,626,Three coppers.
S01E09,Baelor,627,"- How about a nice fat pigeon? - Oh, piss off now. Go on."
S01E09,Baelor,628,Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
S01E09,Baelor,629,Piss off!
S01E09,Baelor,630,"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
S01E09,Baelor,631,- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor. - Who?
S01E09,Baelor,632,The Hand of the King.
S01E09,Baelor,633,- Traitor! - Coward!
S01E09,Baelor,634,Baelor.
S01E09,Baelor,635,Baelor!
S01E09,Baelor,636,Traitor! Traitor!
S01E09,Baelor,637,I am Eddard Stark...
S01E09,Baelor,638,Lord of Winterfell...
S01E09,Baelor,639,and Hand of the King.
S01E09,Baelor,640,I come before you to confess my treason...
S01E09,Baelor,641,in the sight of gods and men.
S01E09,Baelor,642,I betrayed the faith of my king...
S01E09,Baelor,643,and the trust of my friend Robert.
S01E09,Baelor,644,I swore to protect and defend his children.
S01E09,Baelor,645,But before his blood was cold...
S01E09,Baelor,646,I plotted to murder his son...
S01E09,Baelor,647,and seize the throne for myself.
S01E09,Baelor,648,Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say...
S01E09,Baelor,649,Joffrey Baratheon...
S01E09,Baelor,650,is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...
S01E09,Baelor,651,"by the grace of all the gods,"
S01E09,Baelor,652,Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...
S01E09,Baelor,653,and Protector of the Realm.
S01E09,Baelor,654,As... As we sin...
S01E09,Baelor,655,so do we suffer.
S01E09,Baelor,656,This man has confessed his crimes...
S01E09,Baelor,657,in sight of gods and men.
S01E09,Baelor,658,The gods are just...
S01E09,Baelor,659,but beloved Baelor taught us...
S01E09,Baelor,660,they can also be merciful.
S01E09,Baelor,661,"What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
S01E09,Baelor,662,My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.
S01E09,Baelor,663,"Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile."
S01E09,Baelor,664,And my Lady Sansa... has begged mercy for her father.
S01E09,Baelor,665,But they have the soft hearts of women.
S01E09,Baelor,666,So long as I am your king...
S01E09,Baelor,667,treason shall never go unpunished.
S01E09,Baelor,668,Ser Ilyn...
S01E09,Baelor,669,bring me his head!
S01E09,Baelor,670,No!
S01E09,Baelor,671,Someone stop him!
S01E09,Baelor,672,"My son, this is madness."
S01E09,Baelor,673,Put him down!
S01E09,Baelor,674,- Don't look! - Let me go! Let me go!
S01E09,Baelor,675,Shut your mouth! Look at me! Look at me!
S01E09,Baelor,676,Stop! Daddy! Stop!
S01E09,Baelor,677,- No! No! -  Traitor!
S01E09,Baelor,678,Stop!
S01E09,Baelor,679,Stop him! Stop!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,1,Look at me. Look at me!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,2,"Do you remember me now, boy, eh?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,3,Remember me? There's a bright boy.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,4,"You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,5,"- Keep your mouth shut, boy. - I'm not a boy!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,6,"You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,7,"Do you want to live, boy?!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,8,"North, boy, we're going north."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,9,It had three eyes.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,10,"It told me to come with him, so I did."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,11,We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,12,"Your father's not down there, little lord."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,13,Not for many years yet.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,14,- You're afraid. Just like Hodor. - I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,15,You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,16,I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,17,"That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,18,"He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,19,"That's Lyanna, my father's sister."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,20,"King Robert was supposed to marry her,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,21,but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,22,Robert started a war to win her back.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,23,"He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,24,That's where I saw Father.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,25,You see? He's not here.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,26,"- Here, Shaggydog. -  Rickon!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,27,That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,28,- He doesn't like chains. - What are you doing down here?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,29,"- Come back up with us. - No, I came to see Father."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,30,How many times have I told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,31,He was down here. I saw him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,32,Saw him when?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,33,"Last night, when I was sleeping."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,34,"Here, Shaggydog."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,35,You both miss him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,36,"It's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,37,but that doesn't mean that...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,38,Bran...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,39,- My lady. - My lady.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,40,My lady.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,41,My lady.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,42,- My lady. - My lady.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,43,My lady.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,44,Robb.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,45,Robb.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,46,Robb!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,47,You've ruined your sword.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,48,Shh! Shh!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,49,- Shh! - I'll kill them all.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,50,- Every one of them. - Shh.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,51,I will kill them all.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,52,My boy.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,53,They have your sisters.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,54,We have to get the girls back.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,55,And then we will kill them all.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,56,"# The boar's great tusks, they boded ill"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,57,# For good King Robert's health
S01E10,Fire And Blood,58,# And the beast was every bit as fat
S01E10,Fire And Blood,59,# As Robert was himself
S01E10,Fire And Blood,60,"# But our brave king cried, ""Do your worst!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,61,"# ""I'll have your ugly head!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,62,"# ""You're nowhere near as murd'rous as..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,63,"# ""The lion in my bed"""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,64,# King Robert lost his battle and...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,65,# He failed his final test
S01E10,Fire And Blood,66,"# The lion ripped his balls off, and..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,67,# The boar did all the rest #
S01E10,Fire And Blood,68,Very amusing.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,69,Isn't it a funny song?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,70,Thank you for your rendition.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,71,I imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,72,"I'm so sorry, Your Grace."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,73,"I'll never sing it again, I swear."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,74,"Tell me, which do you favour -"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,75,your fingers or your tongue?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,76,Your Grace?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,77,Fingers or your tongue?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,78,"If you got to keep one, which would it be?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,79,Or I could just cut your throat.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,80,"Every man needs hands, Your Grace."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,81,Good.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,82,"- Tongue it is. - Your Grace, please."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,83,"I won't sing, Your Grace."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,84,"Ser Ilyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,85,"I beg you! Please, no."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,86,No!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,87,"Your Grace, please. I beg you, I will never sing again!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,88,- I'm done for the day. - No!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,89,"I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,90,"Your Grace, please!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,91,You look quite nice.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,92,"- Thank you, my lord. - ""Your Grace."" I'm King now."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,93,Stop! No!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,94,Walk with me. I want to show you something.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,95,"Do as you're bid, child."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,96,"...and as soon as you've had your blood, I'll put a son in you."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,97,Mother says that shouldn't be long.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,98,"No! Please, no!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,99,This one's your father.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,100,This one here.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,101,Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,102,- You promised to be merciful. - I was.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,103,I gave him a clean death.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,104,Look at him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,105,"Please let me go home. I won't do any treason, I swear..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,106,Mother says I'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here... and obey.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,107,Look at him!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,108,Well?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,109,How long do I have to look?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,110,As long as it pleases me.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,111,Do you want to see the rest?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,112,If it please Your Grace.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,113,That's your Septa there.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,114,"I'll tell you what, I'm going to give you a present."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,115,"After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,116,I'm going to give you his head as well.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,117,Or maybe he'll give me yours.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,118,My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,119,Ser Meryn.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,120,"Here, girl."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,121,Will you obey now?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,122,Or do you need another lesson?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,123,I'll look for you in court.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,124,"Save yourself some pain, girl."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,125,Give him what he wants.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,126,You'll be needing that again.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,127,The proper course is clear -
S01E10,Fire And Blood,128,pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,129,Renly is not the king.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,130,"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,131,He put your father to death.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,132,That doesn't make Renly king.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,133,He's Robert's youngest brother.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,134,"If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,135,Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,136,- Renly is not right! -  My lords.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,137,- If we put ourselves behind Stannis... - My lords!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,138,Here is what I say to these two kings.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,139,"Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,140,nor Stannis neither.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,141,Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,142,What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,143,Even their gods are wrong!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,144,Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,145,It was the dragons we bowed to...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,146,and now the dragons are dead!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,147,There sits the only king I mean to bend my knee to -
S01E10,Fire And Blood,148,the King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,149,I'll have peace on those terms.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,150,They can keep their Red Castle
S01E10,Fire And Blood,151,and their iron chair too.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,152,The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,153,"Am I your brother, now and always?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,154,Now and always.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,155,My sword is yours...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,156,"in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,157,The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,158,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,159,The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,160,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,161,The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,162,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,163,The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,164,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,165,The King in the North!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,166,- Lady Stark. - I want to see him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,167,Now!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,168,Leave us.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,169,"You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,170,Widowhood becomes you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,171,Your bed must be lonely.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,172,Is that why you came?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,173,"I'm not at my best, but I think I could be of service."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,174,You slip out of that gown and we'll see if I'm up to it.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,175,"Oh, I do like a violent woman."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,176,"I will kill you tonight, ser..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,177,pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,178,Let me show you how...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,179,"Hit me again, over the ear."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,180,And again and again. You're stronger than you look. It shouldn't take long.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,181,"That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,182,"But I don't, my lady."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,183,The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,184,"Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,185,- if the gods are just. - What gods are those?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,186,The trees your husband prayed to?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,187,Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,188,If your gods are real and if they are just...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,189,why is the world so full of injustice?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,190,Because of men like you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,191,There are no men like me.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,192,Only me.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,193,My son Bran.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,194,How did he come to fall from that tower?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,195,I pushed him out the window.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,196,Why?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,197,I... hoped the fall would kill him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,198,Why?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,199,You should get some sleep.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,200,It's going to be a long war.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,201,I can't believe we're actually at war.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,202,"Was it this exciting last time, when you were young?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,203,What does it say?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,204,Have we captured Robb Stark yet?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,205,- What's our next move? - Stop talking.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,206,Get back into bed.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,207,They have my son.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,208,The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,209,I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,210,Is it true about Stannis and Renly?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,211,Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,212,"Jaime captured, his armies scattered..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,213,It's a catastrophe.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,214,Perhaps we should sue for peace.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,215,There's your peace.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,216,Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,217,You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup
S01E10,Fire And Blood,218,than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,219,He's winning...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,220,- in case you hadn't noticed. - I'm told we still have his sisters.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,221,The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,222,No truces. We can't afford to look weak. We should march on them at once.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,223,First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,224,They have my son!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,225,"Get out, all of you."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,226,Not you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,227,You were right about Eddard Stark.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,228,"If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,229,which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,230,Madness. Madness and stupidity.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,231,I always thought you were a stunted fool.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,232,Perhaps I was wrong.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,233,Half wrong.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,234,"I'm new to strategy, but..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,235,"Unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,236,No one will stay here.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,237,Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders
S01E10,Fire And Blood,238,and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,239,The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,240,And you will go to King's Landing.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,241,- And do what? - Rule.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,242,You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,243,"You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,244,And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest -
S01E10,Fire And Blood,245,"- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle... - Heads, spikes, walls."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,246,Why not my uncle?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,247,Why not anyone? Why me?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,248,You're my son.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,249,"Oh, one more thing."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,250,You will not take that whore to court.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,251,Do you understand?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,252,Ser Jorah?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,253,"Gently, gently."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,254,My son...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,255,Where is he? I want him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,256,Where is he?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,257,The boy did not live.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,258,- Tell me. - What is there to tell?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,259,How did my son die?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,260,"He never lived, my princess."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,261,The women say...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,262,What do the women say?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,263,"- They say the child was... -  Monstrous, twisted."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,264,I pulled him out myself.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,265,"He was scaled like a lizard,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,266,"blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,267,When I touched him the skin fell from his bones.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,268,Inside... he was full of graveworms.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,269,I warned you that only death can pay for life.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,270,You knew the price.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,271,Where is Khal Drogo?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,272,Show him to me.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,273,Show me what I bought with my son's life.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,274,"As you command, lady."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,275,Come. I will take you to him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,276,- Time enough for that later... - I want to see him now.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,277,The khalasar is gone.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,278,A khal who cannot ride is no khal.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,279,The Dothraki follow only the strong.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,280,"I'm sorry, my Princess."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,281,Drogo!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,282,My sun and stars.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,283,Why is he out here alone?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,284,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,285,He lives.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,286,"You asked for life, you paid for life."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,287,This is not life. When will he be as he was?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,288,"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,289,When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,290,Leave us.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,291,I don't want you alone with this sorceress.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,292,I have nothing more to fear from this woman.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,293,Go.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,294,You knew what I was buying and you knew the price.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,295,It was wrong of them to burn my temple.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,296,- It angered the Great Shepherd. - This is not God's work.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,297,- My child was innocent. - Innocent?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,298,He would have been the stallion who mounts the world.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,299,Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,300,I spoke for you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,301,- I saved you. -  Saved me?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,302,"Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,303,"I saw my god's house burn,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,304,there where I had healed men and women beyond counting.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,305,In the streets I saw piles of heads...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,306,"the head of the baker who makes my bread,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,307,the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,308,So... tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,309,Your life.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,310,Why don't you take a look at your khal...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,311,Then you will see exactly what life is worth...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,312,when all the rest has gone.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,313,You can't!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,314,"Get out of my way, Sam."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,315,They'll put out the word.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,316,They'll send out ravens. People will come after you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,317,Do you know what happens to deserters?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,318,Better than you do.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,319,What are you going to do?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,320,I'm gonna find my brother
S01E10,Fire And Blood,321,and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,322,You can't leave us now. We need you here.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,323,- Move. - I won't let you go.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,324,- Move. - No.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,325,Hyah!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,326,Hand of the King?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,327,So it would seem.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,328,And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,329,"No, he said I couldn't take you with me to King's Landing."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,330,- He was very specific on that point. - He knew my name?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,331,What?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,332,"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,333,"I believe he used the word ""whore""."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,334,Are you ashamed of me?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,335,Are you afraid that I'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,336,I'm funny now?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,337,"I'm Shae, the funny whore."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,338,My father's probably the most powerful man in the country.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,339,Certainly the richest.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,340,He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,341,Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,342,He's always been a cunt.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,343,I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal
S01E10,Fire And Blood,344,from a girl like you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,345,"Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,346,Because the king needs a Hand and the Hand...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,347,I know what a Hand needs.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,348,Ghost?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,349,Hyah!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,350,Hyah! Hyah!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,351,Hyah!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,352,Samwell!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,353,"- Is he dead? - No, he's not dead."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,354,Did we get him?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,355,"Come on, help me get him up."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,356,Lucky you've got plenty of padding.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,357,We're taking you back to where you belong.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,358,- I belong with my brother. - But we're your brothers now.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,359,They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,360,They'll kill you if they know you came after me.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,361,- Go back. - Sam told us everything.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,362,- We're sorry about your father. - But it doesn't matter.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,363,You took the oath. You can't leave.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,364,- I have to. - You can't.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,365,- You said the words. - I don't care about...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,366,"""Hear my words and bear witness to my vow..."""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,367,"- To hell with all of you. - ""Night gathers and now my watch begins."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,368,"""It shall not end until my death."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,369,"""I shall live and die at my post."""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,370,"""I am the sword in the darkness..."""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,371,"""The watcher on the walls..."""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,372,"""The shield that guards the realms of men."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,373,"""I pledge my life and honour to the Night's Watch,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,374,"""for this night and all nights to come."""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,375,"Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,376,"If you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,377,You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,378,I need you to fight now.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,379,"I know you're very far away,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,380,"but come back to me, my sun and stars."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,381,When the sun...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,382,rises in the west...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,383,...and sets in the east...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,384,"...then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,385,Kings?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,386,"Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about kings."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,387,The thing you need to understand about kings is...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,388,"For the past 67 years, I've known..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,389,truly known... more kings than any man alive.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,390,"They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,391,Yes.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,392,And keep on serving them.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,393,Aerys Targaryen.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,394,Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,395,madness is the worst.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,396,He was a good man.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,397,Such a charmer.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,398,To watch him melt away before my eyes...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,399,consumed by dreams of fire and blood...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,400,Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal -
S01E10,Fire And Blood,401,"powerful man, great warrior -"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,402,"but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,403,are rather different things.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,404,They say that...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,405,"if a man goes through life with his battle visor down,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,406,he can often be blind to the enemies at his side.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,407,Now I serve his son...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,408,King Joffrey...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,409,may the gods bless his reign.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,410,He is a capable young man - strong military mind.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,411,Stern.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,412,But sternness in defence of the realm is no vice.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,413,"It's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,414,I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,415,Mmm.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,416,True greatness.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,417,So what's the thing?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,418,What thing?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,419,About kings.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,420,"You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings..."""
S01E10,Fire And Blood,421,What? Things? What?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,422,"When you started, you... Never mind."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,423,"Let me see you out, my dear."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,424,"- It's all right. No need. - Yes, yes."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,425,Till the next time.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,426,Right.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,427,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,428,Does the crown fit?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,429,"Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,430,the ones who sneered at you for years?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,431,It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,432,A man with great ambition and no morals -
S01E10,Fire And Blood,433,I wouldn't bet against you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,434,"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,435,I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,436,You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,437,"Oh, you can do better than that."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,438,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,439,- I've always wondered. - Have you?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,440,Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,441,I picture... a gash. Like a woman's. Is that about right?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,442,"I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,443,"Must be strange for you, even after all these years..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,444,"a man from another land,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,445,"despised by most,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,446,feared by all...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,447,Am I? That is good to know.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,448,Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,449,But you carry on...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,450,whispering in one king's ear and then the next.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,451,I admire you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,452,"And I admire you, Lord Baelish."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,453,A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,454,"- and women. - A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,455,So...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,456,here we stand...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,457,in mutual admiration and respect.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,458,Playing our roles.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,459,Serving a new king.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,460,Long may he reign.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,461,- My king. - My king.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,462,My lords. Shall we begin?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,463,"You're Arry now, hear me?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,464,Arry the orphan boy.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,465,"No one asks an orphan too many questions, cos nobody gives three shits."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,466,What's your name?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,467,Arry.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,468,"You've a long way to travel, and in bad company."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,469,I've 20 this time - men and boys all bound for the Wall.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,470,"Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,471,and I didn't find no little lordlings down there.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,472,This lot -
S01E10,Fire And Blood,473,half of them would turn you over to the king quick as spit for a pardon.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,474,"And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,475,"So keep to yourself - and when you piss, do it in the woods alone."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,476,"You stay with this lot, boy."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,477,And stay...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,478,or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,479,"Watch yourself, midget."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,480,"He's got a sword, this one."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,481,What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,482,- Maybe he's a little squire. - He ain't no squire. Look at him.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,483,He looks like a girl.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,484,I bet he stole that sword.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,485,Let's have a look.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,486,I could use me a sword like that.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,487,"- Take it off him. - Give it here, midget."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,488,Look at him. You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,489,I've seen him kick a boy to death.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,490,I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls
S01E10,Fire And Blood,491,and I kept kicking him until he was dead.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,492,I kicked him all to pieces.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,493,- You better give me that sword! - You want it?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,494,I'll give it to you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,495,I already killed one fat boy.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,496,I bet you never killed anyone.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,497,I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,498,I'm good at killing fat boys.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,499,I like killing fat boys.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,500,"Like picking on the little ones, do you?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,501,I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,502,"When I hit that steel, it sings."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,503,Are you gonna sing when I hit you?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,504,This is castle-forged steel.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,505,Where'd you steal it?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,506,- It was a gift. - It don't matter now.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,507,"Where we're going, they don't care what you've done."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,508,"They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,509,murderers.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,510,- Which are you? - Armourer's apprentice.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,511,"But my master got sick of me, so... here I am."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,512,"Come on, you sorry sons of whores!"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,513,It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,514,And winter is coming!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,515,Ham.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,516,How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,517,Bring me some beer at least.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,518,You look exhausted.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,519,Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,520,Don't look so terrified.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,521,"If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,522,only ghosts would guard the Wall.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,523,At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,524,"Honour made you leave,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,525,honour brought you back.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,526,My friends brought me back.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,527,I didn't say it was your honour.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,528,- They killed my father. - And you're gonna bring him back to life?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,529,No? Good.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,530,We've had enough of that sort of thing.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,531,"Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,532,At night they see fires blazing in the mountains
S01E10,Fire And Blood,533,from dusk until dawn.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,534,"A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,535,to what ends the gods only know.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,536,Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men
S01E10,Fire And Blood,537,discovered four blue-eyed corpses.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,538,"Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,539,Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,540,No.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,541,"When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,542,do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,543,- No. - Good.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,544,Because I want you and your wolf with us
S01E10,Fire And Blood,545,when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,546,Beyond the Wall?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,547,I'll not sit meekly by... and wait for the snows.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,548,I mean to find out what's happening.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,549,The Night's Watch will ride in force
S01E10,Fire And Blood,550,"against the wildlings, the white walkers and whatever else is out there."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,551,"And we will find Benjen Stark,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,552,alive or dead.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,553,I will command them myself.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,554,"So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,555,Move out!
S01E10,Fire And Blood,556,... are you a brother of the Night's Watch
S01E10,Fire And Blood,557,or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,558,"Is this your command, Khaleesi?"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,559,Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,560,Sell them. You can return to the free cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,561,They were not given to me to sell.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,562,"Khaleesi, my Queen..."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,563,"I vow to serve you, obey you,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,564,to die for you if need be...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,565,"but let him go, Khaleesi."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,566,I know what you intend. Do not.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,567,I must.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,568,You don't understand...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,569,Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,570,I won't watch you burn.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,571,Is that what you fear?
S01E10,Fire And Blood,572,You will be my khalasar.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,573,I see the faces of slaves.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,574,I free you.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,575,"Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,576,But if you stay...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,577,"it will be as brothers and sisters,"
S01E10,Fire And Blood,578,as husbands and wives.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,579,"Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre."
S01E10,Fire And Blood,580,You swore to obey me.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,581,I am Daenerys Stormborn...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,582,of House Targaryen...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,583,of the blood of old Valyria.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,584,I am the Dragon's Daughter.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,585,And I swear to you...
S01E10,Fire And Blood,586,that those who would harm you will die screaming.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,587,- You will not hear me scream. - I will.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,588,But it is not your screams I want.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,589,Only your life.
S01E10,Fire And Blood,590,Blood of my blood.
S02E01,The North Remembers,1,Well struck.
S02E01,The North Remembers,2,"Well struck, dog."
S02E01,The North Remembers,3,Did you like that?
S02E01,The North Remembers,4,"It was well struck, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,5,I already said it was well struck.
S02E01,The North Remembers,6,"Yes, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,7,"- Who's next? - Lothor Brune,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,8,freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.
S02E01,The North Remembers,9,Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
S02E01,The North Remembers,10,Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
S02E01,The North Remembers,11,Here I am.
S02E01,The North Remembers,12,Here I am.
S02E01,The North Remembers,13,"Sorry, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,14,My deepest apologies.
S02E01,The North Remembers,15,- Are you drunk? - No.
S02E01,The North Remembers,16,"No. No, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,17,- I had two cups of wine. - Two cups?
S02E01,The North Remembers,18,That's not much at all.
S02E01,The North Remembers,19,"Please, have another cup."
S02E01,The North Remembers,20,"Are you sure, Your Grace?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,21,Yes. To celebrate my name day.
S02E01,The North Remembers,22,Have two. Have as much as you like.
S02E01,The North Remembers,23,"I would be honoured, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,24,"Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day."
S02E01,The North Remembers,25,See that he drinks his fill.
S02E01,The North Remembers,26,You can't.
S02E01,The North Remembers,27,What did you say?
S02E01,The North Remembers,28,Did you say I can't?
S02E01,The North Remembers,29,I only meant
S02E01,The North Remembers,30,it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
S02E01,The North Remembers,31,What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
S02E01,The North Remembers,32,The girl is right.
S02E01,The North Remembers,33,"What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
S02E01,The North Remembers,34,Take him away.
S02E01,The North Remembers,35,"I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
S02E01,The North Remembers,36,He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,37,He'll make a much better fool than a knight.
S02E01,The North Remembers,38,He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
S02E01,The North Remembers,39,"Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,40,"From this day, you'll be my new fool."
S02E01,The North Remembers,41,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,42,"And you, my lady, thank you."
S02E01,The North Remembers,43,Beloved nephew.
S02E01,The North Remembers,44,We looked for you on the battlefield.
S02E01,The North Remembers,45,You were nowhere to be found.
S02E01,The North Remembers,46,"I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
S02E01,The North Remembers,47,What a fine job you've done.
S02E01,The North Remembers,48,Look at you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,49,More beautiful than ever.
S02E01,The North Remembers,50,And you!
S02E01,The North Remembers,51,"You're going to be bigger than the Hound,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,52,but much better looking.
S02E01,The North Remembers,53,This one doesn't like me.
S02E01,The North Remembers,54,Can't imagine why.
S02E01,The North Remembers,55,- We heard you were dead. - I'm glad you're not dead.
S02E01,The North Remembers,56,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,57,"especially now, with so much excitement in the world."
S02E01,The North Remembers,58,"My lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
S02E01,The North Remembers,59,Her loss?
S02E01,The North Remembers,60,Her father was a confessed traitor.
S02E01,The North Remembers,61,But still her father.
S02E01,The North Remembers,62,"Surely, having so recently lost your own beloved father, you can sympathise."
S02E01,The North Remembers,63,My father was a traitor.
S02E01,The North Remembers,64,"My mother and brother are traitors, too."
S02E01,The North Remembers,65,I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.
S02E01,The North Remembers,66,Of course you are.
S02E01,The North Remembers,67,"Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,68,"Wish I could stay and celebrate,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,69,but there is work to be done.
S02E01,The North Remembers,70,What work?
S02E01,The North Remembers,71,Why are you here?
S02E01,The North Remembers,72,"A raven arrived from the citadel this morning, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,73,"The conclave has met,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,74,"considered reports from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,75,and declared this great summer
S02E01,The North Remembers,76,done at last.
S02E01,The North Remembers,77,The longest summer in living memory.
S02E01,The North Remembers,78,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
S02E01,The North Remembers,79,A common superstition.
S02E01,The North Remembers,80,We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.
S02E01,The North Remembers,81,"If it lasts any longer,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,82,we'll have fewer peasants.
S02E01,The North Remembers,83,"The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war."
S02E01,The North Remembers,84,"We have nowhere to house them. And with winter coming, it'll only get worse."
S02E01,The North Remembers,85,"You command the city watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,86,"I do, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,87,And are you not a lord at my command?
S02E01,The North Remembers,88,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,89,Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants.
S02E01,The North Remembers,90,"They belong in the field, not our capital."
S02E01,The North Remembers,91,"Yes, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,92,Don't get up.
S02E01,The North Remembers,93,"More ravishing than ever, big sister."
S02E01,The North Remembers,94,War agrees with you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,95,Forgive the interruption. Carry on.
S02E01,The North Remembers,96,What are you doing here?
S02E01,The North Remembers,97,It's been a remarkable journey.
S02E01,The North Remembers,98,"I pissed off the edge of the Wall,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,99,"I slept in a sky cell,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,100,I fought with the hill tribes.
S02E01,The North Remembers,101,"So many adventures,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,102,so much to be thankful for.
S02E01,The North Remembers,103,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
S02E01,The North Remembers,104,"Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
S02E01,The North Remembers,105,Our father is Hand of the King.
S02E01,The North Remembers,106,"Yes, but in his absence..."
S02E01,The North Remembers,107,Your father has named Lord Tyrion
S02E01,The North Remembers,108,to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.
S02E01,The North Remembers,109,Out! All of you out!
S02E01,The North Remembers,110,I would like to know how you tricked Father into this.
S02E01,The North Remembers,111,"If I were capable of tricking Father, I'd be emperor of the world by now."
S02E01,The North Remembers,112,You brought this on yourself.
S02E01,The North Remembers,113,I've done nothing.
S02E01,The North Remembers,114,"Quite right, you did nothing"
S02E01,The North Remembers,115,when your son called for Ned Stark's head.
S02E01,The North Remembers,116,Now the entire North has risen up against us.
S02E01,The North Remembers,117,- I tried to stop it. - Did you? You failed.
S02E01,The North Remembers,118,That bit of theatre will haunt our family for a generation.
S02E01,The North Remembers,119,- Robb Stark is a child. - Who's won every battle he's fought.
S02E01,The North Remembers,120,Do you understand we're losing the war?
S02E01,The North Remembers,121,- What do you know about warfare? - Nothing.
S02E01,The North Remembers,122,But I know people.
S02E01,The North Remembers,123,And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
S02E01,The North Remembers,124,- Joffrey is king. - Joffrey is king.
S02E01,The North Remembers,125,You are here to advise him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,126,I'm only here to advise him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,127,"And if the king listens to what I say,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,128,the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.
S02E01,The North Remembers,129,How?
S02E01,The North Remembers,130,You love your children.
S02E01,The North Remembers,131,It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones.
S02E01,The North Remembers,132,The Starks love their children as well.
S02E01,The North Remembers,133,- And we have two of them. - One.
S02E01,The North Remembers,134,"- One? - Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
S02E01,The North Remembers,135,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,136,We had three Starks to trade.
S02E01,The North Remembers,137,You chopped one's head off and let another escape.
S02E01,The North Remembers,138,Father will be furious.
S02E01,The North Remembers,139,It must be odd for you
S02E01,The North Remembers,140,to be the disappointing child.
S02E01,The North Remembers,141,"My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother"
S02E01,The North Remembers,142,and all our Northern sons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,143,The walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter.
S02E01,The North Remembers,144,"The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,145,and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.
S02E01,The North Remembers,146,"When I was a boy,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,147,I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer.
S02E01,The North Remembers,148,Men worked back then.
S02E01,The North Remembers,149,"Today, my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children."
S02E01,The North Remembers,150,At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.
S02E01,The North Remembers,151,Gods forbid it rains.
S02E01,The North Remembers,152,"Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
S02E01,The North Remembers,153,Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast.
S02E01,The North Remembers,154,"Generally, yes,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,155,but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.
S02E01,The North Remembers,156,King Robb. And it's not his war.
S02E01,The North Remembers,157,He didn't choose it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,158,"Maybe not, my lord, but he called in his banners and took the men."
S02E01,The North Remembers,159,"Joffrey killed my father,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,160,your liege lord.
S02E01,The North Remembers,161,"Do you remember your vows, ser?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,162,Of course I remember!
S02E01,The North Remembers,163,"We can spare four masons for a week, my lord."
S02E01,The North Remembers,164,Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
S02E01,The North Remembers,165,I believe it will.
S02E01,The North Remembers,166,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,167,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
S02E01,The North Remembers,168,Nor did I.
S02E01,The North Remembers,169,But listening to people you'd rather not listen to
S02E01,The North Remembers,170,is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.
S02E01,The North Remembers,171,Lord Portan.
S02E01,The North Remembers,172,"My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother"
S02E01,The North Remembers,173,and all our Northern sons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,174,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.
S02E01,The North Remembers,175,Makes all your pain go away.
S02E01,The North Remembers,176,Don't have any pain.
S02E01,The North Remembers,177,Lucky for you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,178,That way.
S02E01,The North Remembers,179,You've been having those dreams again.
S02E01,The North Remembers,180,I don't dream.
S02E01,The North Remembers,181,Everyone dreams.
S02E01,The North Remembers,182,I don't.
S02E01,The North Remembers,183,Heard some of the men talking about the comet.
S02E01,The North Remembers,184,They say it's an omen.
S02E01,The North Remembers,185,They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
S02E01,The North Remembers,186,Did they?
S02E01,The North Remembers,187,I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.
S02E01,The North Remembers,188,Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.
S02E01,The North Remembers,189,Heard a stable boy say it's the colour of blood
S02E01,The North Remembers,190,to mark the death of your father.
S02E01,The North Remembers,191,The stars don't fall for men.
S02E01,The North Remembers,192,"Red comet means one thing, boy."
S02E01,The North Remembers,193,Dragons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,194,The dragons are all dead.
S02E01,The North Remembers,195,They've been dead for centuries.
S02E01,The North Remembers,196,Mmm.
S02E01,The North Remembers,197,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,198,He said they ate meat.
S02E01,The North Remembers,199,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
S02E01,The North Remembers,200,My brother didn't know anything about dragons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,201,He didn't know anything about anything.
S02E01,The North Remembers,202,Eh.
S02E01,The North Remembers,203,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
S02E01,The North Remembers,204,I remember.
S02E01,The North Remembers,205,I promised to protect them.
S02E01,The North Remembers,206,Promised them their enemies would die screaming.
S02E01,The North Remembers,207,How do I make starvation scream?
S02E01,The North Remembers,208,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
S02E01,The North Remembers,209,Does it ever end?
S02E01,The North Remembers,210,This is further east than I've ever been.
S02E01,The North Remembers,211,"But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the Red Waste."
S02E01,The North Remembers,212,And you're sure there's no other way?
S02E01,The North Remembers,213,"If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,214,the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,215,"If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,216,the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,217,No one will take my dragons.
S02E01,The North Remembers,218,"They are too weak to fight,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,219,as are your people.
S02E01,The North Remembers,220,You must be their strength.
S02E01,The North Remembers,221,As you are mine.
S02E01,The North Remembers,222,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses."
S02E01,The North Remembers,223,"You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
S02E01,The North Remembers,224,"What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,225,"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea."
S02E01,The North Remembers,226,"Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
S02E01,The North Remembers,227,Rakharo.
S02E01,The North Remembers,228,"You are my last hope, blood of my blood."
S02E01,The North Remembers,229,"I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
S02E01,The North Remembers,230,You never have.
S02E01,The North Remembers,231,This is bad time to start.
S02E01,The North Remembers,232,Having a rough time of it?
S02E01,The North Remembers,233,Nothing's killed me yet.
S02E01,The North Remembers,234,- Your arse killed the sledge. - You offered me a ride.
S02E01,The North Remembers,235,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
S02E01,The North Remembers,236,I was born in a place like this.
S02E01,The North Remembers,237,"Later, I fell on hard times."
S02E01,The North Remembers,238,Are those girls?
S02E01,The North Remembers,239,Craster's daughters.
S02E01,The North Remembers,240,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
S02E01,The North Remembers,241,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,242,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,243,He don't like people messing with his wives.
S02E01,The North Remembers,244,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters."
S02E01,The North Remembers,245,And on and on it goes.
S02E01,The North Remembers,246,- That's foul. - It's beyond foul.
S02E01,The North Remembers,247,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.
S02E01,The North Remembers,248,Craster's still here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,249,He must be doing something right.
S02E01,The North Remembers,250,What happens to the boys?
S02E01,The North Remembers,251,Hmm?
S02E01,The North Remembers,252,He marries his daughters.
S02E01,The North Remembers,253,What does he do with his sons?
S02E01,The North Remembers,254,He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
S02E01,The North Remembers,255,People make all sorts of plans.
S02E01,The North Remembers,256,I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.
S02E01,The North Remembers,257,Haven't missed him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,258,Always treated me like scum.
S02E01,The North Remembers,259,Haven't had any good wine for a long time.
S02E01,The North Remembers,260,"You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
S02E01,The North Remembers,261,We're not Southerners.
S02E01,The North Remembers,262,Who's this little girl?
S02E01,The North Remembers,263,You're prettier than half my daughters.
S02E01,The North Remembers,264,You got a nice wet twat between your legs?
S02E01,The North Remembers,265,What's your name?
S02E01,The North Remembers,266,"- Jon Snow. - Snow, eh?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,267,"Listen to me, bastard."
S02E01,The North Remembers,268,"All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners."
S02E01,The North Remembers,269,"But now you're in the North, the real North."
S02E01,The North Remembers,270,The lad meant no harm.
S02E01,The North Remembers,271,I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters...
S02E01,The North Remembers,272,"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word."
S02E01,The North Remembers,273,"Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
S02E01,The North Remembers,274,You bring any of that good wine with you?
S02E01,The North Remembers,275,We did.
S02E01,The North Remembers,276,We passed through six villages on the way here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,277,All six were abandoned.
S02E01,The North Remembers,278,Where have all the wildlings gone?
S02E01,The North Remembers,279,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
S02E01,The North Remembers,280,There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.
S02E01,The North Remembers,281,"- Bring it in here. - Yes, Commander."
S02E01,The North Remembers,282,You want to know where they've all gone?
S02E01,The North Remembers,283,"North, to join up with Mance Rayder."
S02E01,The North Remembers,284,Your old friend.
S02E01,The North Remembers,285,He's no friend of mine.
S02E01,The North Remembers,286,"- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers. - Aye."
S02E01,The North Remembers,287,But once he was just a poor black crow.
S02E01,The North Remembers,288,And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.
S02E01,The North Remembers,289,He's been calling himself that for years.
S02E01,The North Remembers,290,What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
S02E01,The North Remembers,291,That's a good-looking axe.
S02E01,The North Remembers,292,Fresh forged?
S02E01,The North Remembers,293,Give it here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,294,You'll have another one made at Castle Black.
S02E01,The North Remembers,295,Here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,296,That's some lovely steel.
S02E01,The North Remembers,297,You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?
S02E01,The North Remembers,298,Gathering an army.
S02E01,The North Remembers,299,"What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your Southern Kings."
S02E01,The North Remembers,300,And where does he plan marching this army?
S02E01,The North Remembers,301,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
S02E01,The North Remembers,302,These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.
S02E01,The North Remembers,303,The cold winds are rising.
S02E01,The North Remembers,304,Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.
S02E01,The North Remembers,305,"Wife,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,306,tell the Lord Crow how content we are.
S02E01,The North Remembers,307,This is our place.
S02E01,The North Remembers,308,Our husband keeps us safe.
S02E01,The North Remembers,309,Better to live free than die a slave.
S02E01,The North Remembers,310,"Don't it make you jealous, old man,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,311,to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?
S02E01,The North Remembers,312,We chose different paths.
S02E01,The North Remembers,313,"Aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it."
S02E01,The North Remembers,314,"You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,315,and eat me out of pigs.
S02E01,The North Remembers,316,A roof would be welcome.
S02E01,The North Remembers,317,It's been hard riding.
S02E01,The North Remembers,318,We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,319,"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,320,he loses the hand.
S02E01,The North Remembers,321,"And I see this one staring too long,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,322,I might just gouge his eyes out.
S02E01,The North Remembers,323,"Your roof, your rules."
S02E01,The North Remembers,324,Who am I?
S02E01,The North Remembers,325,- Who am I? - Lord Commander.
S02E01,The North Remembers,326,- And who are you? - Jon Snow.
S02E01,The North Remembers,327,Who are you?
S02E01,The North Remembers,328,Your steward.
S02E01,The North Remembers,329,You want to lead one day?
S02E01,The North Remembers,330,Then learn how to follow.
S02E01,The North Remembers,331,"Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness."
S02E01,The North Remembers,332,We offer you these false gods.
S02E01,The North Remembers,333,"Take them and cast your light upon us,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,334,for the night is dark and full of terrors.
S02E01,The North Remembers,335,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
S02E01,The North Remembers,336,"After the long summer,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,337,darkness will fall heavy on the world.
S02E01,The North Remembers,338,The stars will bleed.
S02E01,The North Remembers,339,We need to stop her.
S02E01,The North Remembers,340,The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas...
S02E01,The North Remembers,341,- Not now. ...and the dead shall rise in the North.
S02E01,The North Remembers,342,All you men were named in the light of the Seven!
S02E01,The North Remembers,343,Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?
S02E01,The North Remembers,344,Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
S02E01,The North Remembers,345,"You smell of fear,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,346,fear and piss and old bones.
S02E01,The North Remembers,347,Do you want to stop me?
S02E01,The North Remembers,348,Stop me.
S02E01,The North Remembers,349,"In the ancient books, it's written"
S02E01,The North Remembers,350,that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.
S02E01,The North Remembers,351,And that sword shall be Lightbringer.
S02E01,The North Remembers,352,"Stannis Baratheon,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,353,"Warrior of Light,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,354,your sword awaits you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,355,"Lord, cast your light upon us!"
S02E01,The North Remembers,356,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
S02E01,The North Remembers,357,For the night is dark and full of terror.
S02E01,The North Remembers,358,This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
S02E01,The North Remembers,359,Stannis is our king.
S02E01,The North Remembers,360,"We follow where he leads,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,361,- even if we don't like the path. - King.
S02E01,The North Remembers,362,"Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
S02E01,The North Remembers,363,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
S02E01,The North Remembers,364,"As do I,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,365,but loyal service means telling hard truths.
S02E01,The North Remembers,366,"He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,367,"but he trusts you, Davos."
S02E01,The North Remembers,368,If you tell him the truth...
S02E01,The North Remembers,369,What's the truth?
S02E01,The North Remembers,370,"""And I declare upon the honour of my house that my beloved brother Robert..."""
S02E01,The North Remembers,371,He wasn't my beloved brother.
S02E01,The North Remembers,372,I didn't love him. He didn't love me.
S02E01,The North Remembers,373,"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,374,A lie. Take it out.
S02E01,The North Remembers,375,"""That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,376,"""the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest"
S02E01,The North Remembers,377,"""between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister."
S02E01,The North Remembers,378,"- ""By right of birth..."" - Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer."
S02E01,The North Remembers,379,Call him what he is.
S02E01,The North Remembers,380,"""And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer."""
S02E01,The North Remembers,381,"""By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim..."""
S02E01,The North Remembers,382,"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer."
S02E01,The North Remembers,383,"Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
S02E01,The North Remembers,384,"""Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer."
S02E01,The North Remembers,385,"""By right of birth and blood,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,386,"""I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros."
S02E01,The North Remembers,387,"""Let all true men declare their loyalty."""
S02E01,The North Remembers,388,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me."
S02E01,The North Remembers,389,I'll not make the same mistake.
S02E01,The North Remembers,390,"Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,391,from the Arbor to the Wall.
S02E01,The North Remembers,392,The time has come to choose.
S02E01,The North Remembers,393,Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.
S02E01,The North Remembers,394,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy."
S02E01,The North Remembers,395,"If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother..."
S02E01,The North Remembers,396,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself king.
S02E01,The North Remembers,397,"Well, many have already declared for him,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,398,"Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
S02E01,The North Remembers,399,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.
S02E01,The North Remembers,400,The Lord of Light stands behind him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,401,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
S02E01,The North Remembers,402,"- He has no need for ships. - I'm sure he doesn't,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,403,but we do if we're going to war.
S02E01,The North Remembers,404,"If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
S02E01,The North Remembers,405,Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.
S02E01,The North Remembers,406,"I've always served thieves according to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos."
S02E01,The North Remembers,407,"Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves."
S02E01,The North Remembers,408,They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.
S02E01,The North Remembers,409,"I owe you an apology, my king."
S02E01,The North Remembers,410,My duty is to serve.
S02E01,The North Remembers,411,You have chosen the new god over the old gods.
S02E01,The North Remembers,412,May the Lord of Light watch over us all.
S02E01,The North Remembers,413,Shall we drink together?
S02E01,The North Remembers,414,Don't.
S02E01,The North Remembers,415,A cup of wine to honour the one true god.
S02E01,The North Remembers,416,"The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,417,but the fire burns them all away.
S02E01,The North Remembers,418,King in the North.
S02E01,The North Remembers,419,"I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,420,but you drag me along from camp to camp.
S02E01,The North Remembers,421,"Have you grown fond of me, Stark?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,422,Is that it?
S02E01,The North Remembers,423,I've never seen you with a girl.
S02E01,The North Remembers,424,"If I left you with one of my bannermen,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,425,your father would know within a fortnight
S02E01,The North Remembers,426,"and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,427,"""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams."
S02E01,The North Remembers,428,"""Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem."""
S02E01,The North Remembers,429,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
S02E01,The North Remembers,430,"Oh, I trust them with my life,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,431,just not with yours.
S02E01,The North Remembers,432,Smart boy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,433,What's wrong?
S02E01,The North Remembers,434,"Don't like being called ""boy""?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,435,Insulted?
S02E01,The North Remembers,436,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer."
S02E01,The North Remembers,437,You've been defeated by a boy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,438,You're held captive by a boy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,439,Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,440,Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros.
S02E01,The North Remembers,441,King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king
S02E01,The North Remembers,442,nor a true Baratheon.
S02E01,The North Remembers,443,He's your bastard son.
S02E01,The North Remembers,444,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king."
S02E01,The North Remembers,445,How convenient for him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,446,My father learned the truth.
S02E01,The North Remembers,447,That's why you had him executed.
S02E01,The North Remembers,448,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
S02E01,The North Remembers,449,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,450,"And you,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,451,you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
S02E01,The North Remembers,452,You have proof?
S02E01,The North Remembers,453,Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
S02E01,The North Remembers,454,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
S02E01,The North Remembers,455,You think my father's going to negotiate with you?
S02E01,The North Remembers,456,You don't know him very well.
S02E01,The North Remembers,457,"No, but he's starting to know me."
S02E01,The North Remembers,458,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
S02E01,The North Remembers,459,It's better than three defeats.
S02E01,The North Remembers,460,This city stinks.
S02E01,The North Remembers,461,Like dead bodies.
S02E01,The North Remembers,462,"A bit corpsey, yes."
S02E01,The North Remembers,463,And shit.
S02E01,The North Remembers,464,I thought you wanted to come here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,465,I love it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,466,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
S02E01,The North Remembers,467,And cum and garlic and rum.
S02E01,The North Remembers,468,You can smell cum from the balcony?
S02E01,The North Remembers,469,I love the stink. I love the noise.
S02E01,The North Remembers,470,Cities make me want to fuck.
S02E01,The North Remembers,471,And so did the country.
S02E01,The North Remembers,472,This is where I belong.
S02E01,The North Remembers,473,"Yes, well, you need to be careful."
S02E01,The North Remembers,474,No one can know you're here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,475,No one will know.
S02E01,The North Remembers,476,You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.
S02E01,The North Remembers,477,"They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,478,one or two great liars.
S02E01,The North Remembers,479,What about you?
S02E01,The North Remembers,480,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
S02E01,The North Remembers,481,Truth?
S02E01,The North Remembers,482,You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
S02E01,The North Remembers,483,Why do you think I am so little?
S02E01,The North Remembers,484,I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.
S02E01,The North Remembers,485,Ned Stark actually slept on this.
S02E01,The North Remembers,486,As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.
S02E01,The North Remembers,487,One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,488,Lord Baelish.
S02E01,The North Remembers,489,Your Grace.
S02E01,The North Remembers,490,I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.
S02E01,The North Remembers,491,"Of course, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,492,"Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,493,we can't seem to locate her.
S02E01,The North Remembers,494,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
S02E01,The North Remembers,495,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
S02E01,The North Remembers,496,Curious.
S02E01,The North Remembers,497,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,498,the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...
S02E01,The North Remembers,499,"Well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
S02E01,The North Remembers,500,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is."
S02E01,The North Remembers,501,He'll have an answer for you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,502,Whether you believe it...
S02E01,The North Remembers,503,"Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs."
S02E01,The North Remembers,504,Who knows what they want?
S02E01,The North Remembers,505,A mockingbird.
S02E01,The North Remembers,506,"- You created your own sigil, didn't you? - Yes."
S02E01,The North Remembers,507,"Appropriate, for a self-made man with so many songs to sing."
S02E01,The North Remembers,508,I'm glad you like it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,509,Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.
S02E01,The North Remembers,510,Others have to find their own way.
S02E01,The North Remembers,511,I heard a song once
S02E01,The North Remembers,512,about a boy of modest means
S02E01,The North Remembers,513,who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.
S02E01,The North Remembers,514,He loved the eldest daughter.
S02E01,The North Remembers,515,"Sadly, she had eyes for another."
S02E01,The North Remembers,516,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise."
S02E01,The North Remembers,517,"Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections."
S02E01,The North Remembers,518,"And when those affections become common knowledge,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,519,"well, that is an awkward situation indeed,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,520,especially in a prominent family.
S02E01,The North Remembers,521,"But prominent families often forget a simple truth,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,522,I've found.
S02E01,The North Remembers,523,And which truth is that?
S02E01,The North Remembers,524,Knowledge is power.
S02E01,The North Remembers,525,Seize him.
S02E01,The North Remembers,526,Cut his throat.
S02E01,The North Remembers,527,Stop. Wait.
S02E01,The North Remembers,528,I've changed my mind. Let him go.
S02E01,The North Remembers,529,Step back three paces.
S02E01,The North Remembers,530,Turn around.
S02E01,The North Remembers,531,Close your eyes.
S02E01,The North Remembers,532,Power is power.
S02E01,The North Remembers,533,Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores
S02E01,The North Remembers,534,to locate the Stark girl for me.
S02E01,The North Remembers,535,I would very much appreciate it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,536,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
S02E01,The North Remembers,537,"I am, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,538,I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms.
S02E01,The North Remembers,539,"First, your family must release my sisters."
S02E01,The North Remembers,540,"Second, my father's bones must be returned to us"
S02E01,The North Remembers,541,so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
S02E01,The North Remembers,542,And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.
S02E01,The North Remembers,543,Their families can honour them with proper funerals.
S02E01,The North Remembers,544,"- An honourable request, Your Grace. - Third..."
S02E01,The North Remembers,545,Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.
S02E01,The North Remembers,546,"From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
S02E01,The North Remembers,547,The King in the North.
S02E01,The North Remembers,548,- King in the North. - King in the North.
S02E01,The North Remembers,549,Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.
S02E01,The North Remembers,550,"If he disregards this command,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,551,"he shall suffer the same fate as my father,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,552,only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.
S02E01,The North Remembers,553,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
S02E01,The North Remembers,554,These are my terms.
S02E01,The North Remembers,555,"If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,556,"If not,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,557,I will litter the South with Lannister dead.
S02E01,The North Remembers,558,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,559,"Oh, is he?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,560,"You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton."
S02E01,The North Remembers,561,That will be all for tonight.
S02E01,The North Remembers,562,"A word, Your Grace?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,563,"You don't have to call me ""Your Grace"" when no one's around."
S02E01,The North Remembers,564,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,565,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,566,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,567,Of course they are.
S02E01,The North Remembers,568,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,569,but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.
S02E01,The North Remembers,570,And we can't take King's Landing without ships.
S02E01,The North Remembers,571,My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.
S02E01,The North Remembers,572,Men who fought my father.
S02E01,The North Remembers,573,Men who fought King Robert to free themselves
S02E01,The North Remembers,574,"from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now."
S02E01,The North Remembers,575,I'm his only living son.
S02E01,The North Remembers,576,He'll listen to me. I know he will.
S02E01,The North Remembers,577,I'm not a Stark. I know that.
S02E01,The North Remembers,578,But your father raised me to be an honourable man.
S02E01,The North Remembers,579,We can avenge him together.
S02E01,The North Remembers,580,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
S02E01,The North Remembers,581,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
S02E01,The North Remembers,582,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.
S02E01,The North Remembers,583,Shall we rally them to fight for us?
S02E01,The North Remembers,584,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,585,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,586,Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
S02E01,The North Remembers,587,Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.
S02E01,The North Remembers,588,"Before me, it was Father."
S02E01,The North Remembers,589,You married one rebel and mothered another.
S02E01,The North Remembers,590,"I mothered more than just rebels,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,591,a fact you seem to have forgotten.
S02E01,The North Remembers,592,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
S02E01,The North Remembers,593,You want to leave Sansa in the queen's hands?
S02E01,The North Remembers,594,And Arya...
S02E01,The North Remembers,595,"I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for, if not for them?"
S02E01,The North Remembers,596,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
S02E01,The North Remembers,597,It's time for me to go home.
S02E01,The North Remembers,598,I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
S02E01,The North Remembers,599,You can't go to Winterfell.
S02E01,The North Remembers,600,I beg your pardon?
S02E01,The North Remembers,601,I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys
S02E01,The North Remembers,602,because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
S02E01,The North Remembers,603,Why in the name of all the gods...
S02E01,The North Remembers,604,Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.
S02E01,The North Remembers,605,"He's rallied an army of 100,000."
S02E01,The North Remembers,606,You know him. You know his family.
S02E01,The North Remembers,607,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.
S02E01,The North Remembers,608,You have a hundred other lords...
S02E01,The North Remembers,609,Which of these lords do I trust more than you?
S02E01,The North Remembers,610,"If Renly sides with us,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,611,we'll outnumber them two to one.
S02E01,The North Remembers,612,"When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace."
S02E01,The North Remembers,613,We'll get the girls back.
S02E01,The North Remembers,614,"Then we'll all go home, for good."
S02E01,The North Remembers,615,I will ride at first light.
S02E01,The North Remembers,616,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
S02E01,The North Remembers,617,You've done so well.
S02E01,The North Remembers,618,Your father would be proud.
S02E01,The North Remembers,619,- Give Lord Renly my regards. - King Renly.
S02E01,The North Remembers,620,There's a king in every corner now.
S02E01,The North Remembers,621,What is all this?
S02E01,The North Remembers,622,Returning this room to its proper appearance.
S02E01,The North Remembers,623,"Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors."
S02E01,The North Remembers,624,That is a seat for a conqueror.
S02E01,The North Remembers,625,"It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
S02E01,The North Remembers,626,We can't find Arya Stark.
S02E01,The North Remembers,627,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
S02E01,The North Remembers,628,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her."
S02E01,The North Remembers,629,They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.
S02E01,The North Remembers,630,I think they might. They're weak.
S02E01,The North Remembers,631,They put too much value on their women.
S02E01,The North Remembers,632,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.
S02E01,The North Remembers,633,Send out as many men as we can.
S02E01,The North Remembers,634,I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...
S02E01,The North Remembers,635,"The king does not ask, he commands."
S02E01,The North Remembers,636,And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle
S02E01,The North Remembers,637,is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
S02E01,The North Remembers,638,His life is in danger.
S02E01,The North Remembers,639,We're at war.
S02E01,The North Remembers,640,All our lives are in danger.
S02E01,The North Remembers,641,I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.
S02E01,The North Remembers,642,And you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,643,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
S02E01,The North Remembers,644,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
S02E01,The North Remembers,645,Of course it is.
S02E01,The North Remembers,646,No one believes this foul gossip.
S02E01,The North Remembers,647,Someone believes it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,648,Father had other children?
S02E01,The North Remembers,649,Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
S02E01,The North Remembers,650,What are you asking?
S02E01,The North Remembers,651,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you.
S02E01,The North Remembers,652,How many bastards does he have running...
S02E01,The North Remembers,653,What you just did is punishable by death.
S02E01,The North Remembers,654,You will never do it again.
S02E01,The North Remembers,655,Never.
S02E01,The North Remembers,656,"That will be all, Mother."
S02E01,The North Remembers,657,"No, no, no, no."
S02E01,The North Remembers,658,Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
S02E01,The North Remembers,659,Ease into it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,660,"Slowly, with passion."
S02E01,The North Remembers,661,"Oh, yeah."
S02E01,The North Remembers,662,Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.
S02E01,The North Remembers,663,Both of you are working tonight.
S02E01,The North Remembers,664,"We do things differently here, Daisy."
S02E01,The North Remembers,665,This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
S02E01,The North Remembers,666,- Haystack Hall. - Wherever you're from.
S02E01,The North Remembers,667,Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders.
S02E01,The North Remembers,668,Lord Olsen.
S02E01,The North Remembers,669,Taste is everything here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,670,Littlefinger's a fancy man.
S02E01,The North Remembers,671,Don't call him Littlefinger.
S02E01,The North Remembers,672,He doesn't like it.
S02E01,The North Remembers,673,Lord Baelish.
S02E01,The North Remembers,674,She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue
S02E01,The North Remembers,675,so that people will think she's exotic.
S02E01,The North Remembers,676,She grew up just down the road in Flea Bottom.
S02E01,The North Remembers,677,She's beautiful.
S02E01,The North Remembers,678,"She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot."
S02E01,The North Remembers,679,Lord Commander.
S02E01,The North Remembers,680,Good to see you again.
S02E01,The North Remembers,681,"You do realise this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,"
S02E01,The North Remembers,682,the King's Master of Coin.
S02E01,The North Remembers,683,Coin which goes in many pockets.
S02E01,The North Remembers,684,- Orders. - Whose orders?
S02E01,The North Remembers,685,Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
S02E01,The North Remembers,686,"No, you can't. No! Please!"
S02E01,The North Remembers,687,No! Not my Barra!
S02E01,The North Remembers,688,- Please. Please. - Enough. Get it done.
S02E01,The North Remembers,689,"- Kill the bastard. - No, no!"
S02E01,The North Remembers,690,- Please. - Give it here.
S02E01,The North Remembers,691,"No, please."
S02E01,The North Remembers,692,Spread out. Search every house.
S02E01,The North Remembers,693,Every room. Look in every room.
S02E01,The North Remembers,694,Gendry! His name is Gendry.
S02E01,The North Remembers,695,Where is the bastard?
S02E01,The North Remembers,696,"The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
S02E01,The North Remembers,697,Where?
S02E01,The North Remembers,698,"They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north."
S02E01,The North Remembers,699,- How will we know him? - He's got a bull's head helmet.
S02E01,The North Remembers,700,- He made it himself. - Find him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,1,Gotta be ready before nightfall.
S02E02,The Night Lands,2,Now keep it moving.
S02E02,The Night Lands,3,Put a watch on the ridge and the tree lines.
S02E02,The Night Lands,4,Boy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,5,Lovely boy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,6,What do you want?
S02E02,The Night Lands,7,A man has a thirst.
S02E02,The Night Lands,8,A man does not drink for a day and a night.
S02E02,The Night Lands,9,A boy could make a friend.
S02E02,The Night Lands,10,I have friends.
S02E02,The Night Lands,11,Give us beer before I skin you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,12,A man does not choose his companions.
S02E02,The Night Lands,13,"These two, they have no courtesy."
S02E02,The Night Lands,14,A man must ask forgiveness.
S02E02,The Night Lands,15,You're called Arry?
S02E02,The Night Lands,16,"This man has the honour to be Jaqen H'ghar,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,17,once of the Free City of Lorath...
S02E02,The Night Lands,18,"Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!"
S02E02,The Night Lands,19,You should have asked nicely.
S02E02,The Night Lands,20,Aah!
S02E02,The Night Lands,21,Come closer...
S02E02,The Night Lands,22,and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole
S02E02,The Night Lands,23,and fuck you bloody.
S02E02,The Night Lands,24,That boy has more courage than sense.
S02E02,The Night Lands,25,Come here!
S02E02,The Night Lands,26,Yoren said none of us were to go near those three.
S02E02,The Night Lands,27,Come here!
S02E02,The Night Lands,28,They don't scare me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,29,Hmm? Then you're stupid.
S02E02,The Night Lands,30,They scare me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,31,What are gold cloaks doing so far from King's Landing?
S02E02,The Night Lands,32,What are you doing?
S02E02,The Night Lands,33,They're looking for me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,34,You in command here?
S02E02,The Night Lands,35,You're a long way from home.
S02E02,The Night Lands,36,I asked you a question.
S02E02,The Night Lands,37,"Aye, you did."
S02E02,The Night Lands,38,You asked without manners
S02E02,The Night Lands,39,and I chose not to answer.
S02E02,The Night Lands,40,I have a royal warrant
S02E02,The Night Lands,41,for one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
S02E02,The Night Lands,42,"Well, the thing is..."
S02E02,The Night Lands,43,these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now.
S02E02,The Night Lands,44,That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
S02E02,The Night Lands,45,Does it?
S02E02,The Night Lands,46,"It's a funny thing,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,47,people worry so much about their throats
S02E02,The Night Lands,48,that they forget about what's down low.
S02E02,The Night Lands,49,"Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast."
S02E02,The Night Lands,50,I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.
S02E02,The Night Lands,51,Or... I could nick this artery in your leg.
S02E02,The Night Lands,52,"And once it's nicked,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,53,there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,54,We'll just keep that.
S02E02,The Night Lands,55,Good steel is always needed on the Wall.
S02E02,The Night Lands,56,"Seems you have a choice,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,57,"you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,58,or you can go back to your city and tell your masters
S02E02,The Night Lands,59,you didn't find what you were looking for.
S02E02,The Night Lands,60,We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
S02E02,The Night Lands,61,He carries a bull's head helmet.
S02E02,The Night Lands,62,Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward.
S02E02,The Night Lands,63,We'll be back with more men
S02E02,The Night Lands,64,and I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,65,My lord.
S02E02,The Night Lands,66,"You make me wait a long time,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,67,but your friend keeps me company.
S02E02,The Night Lands,68,We were just speaking of your bravery
S02E02,The Night Lands,69,in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
S02E02,The Night Lands,70,It was quite a battle.
S02E02,The Night Lands,71,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
S02E02,The Night Lands,72,The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
S02E02,The Night Lands,73,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
S02E02,The Night Lands,74,To find so lovely a creature working in your father's kitchens...
S02E02,The Night Lands,75,It almost beggars belief.
S02E02,The Night Lands,76,Strange things do happen.
S02E02,The Night Lands,77,You should taste her fish pie.
S02E02,The Night Lands,78,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
S02E02,The Night Lands,79,- How can you tell? - I can always tell.
S02E02,The Night Lands,80,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us.
S02E02,The Night Lands,81,We'll make a fisherman of him yet.
S02E02,The Night Lands,82,I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.
S02E02,The Night Lands,83,Friends are such an important part of life.
S02E02,The Night Lands,84,Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come.
S02E02,The Night Lands,85,"But rest easy, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,86,I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
S02E02,The Night Lands,87,Your discretion is legendary...
S02E02,The Night Lands,88,Where your friends are concerned.
S02E02,The Night Lands,89,How unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest.
S02E02,The Night Lands,90,I will leave you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,91,"Welcome to King's Landing, my dear."
S02E02,The Night Lands,92,This city is made brighter by your presence.
S02E02,The Night Lands,93,"We have a council meeting, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,94,I don't like threats.
S02E02,The Night Lands,95,Who threatened you?
S02E02,The Night Lands,96,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
S02E02,The Night Lands,97,Ned Stark was a man of honour.
S02E02,The Night Lands,98,And I am not.
S02E02,The Night Lands,99,Threaten me again and I'll have you thrown into the sea.
S02E02,The Night Lands,100,You might be disappointed in the results.
S02E02,The Night Lands,101,"Storms come and go,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,102,"the big fish eat the little fish,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,103,and I keep on paddling.
S02E02,The Night Lands,104,"Come, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,105,We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
S02E02,The Night Lands,106,"""From this time until the end of time,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,107,"""we are not part of your realm,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,108,"""but a free and independent Kingdom of the North."""
S02E02,The Night Lands,109,"He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
S02E02,The Night Lands,110,You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.
S02E02,The Night Lands,111,"We can give him his father's bones back, at least,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,112,as a gesture of good faith.
S02E02,The Night Lands,113,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,114,"I will, Your Grace."
S02E02,The Night Lands,115,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest?
S02E02,The Night Lands,116,I did.
S02E02,The Night Lands,117,"They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
S02E02,The Night Lands,118,"If you speak with him,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,119,tell him he's not been forgotten.
S02E02,The Night Lands,120,"- I will, Your Grace. - Safe travels, cousin."
S02E02,The Night Lands,121,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,122,If that's everything...
S02E02,The Night Lands,123,A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
S02E02,The Night Lands,124,Trouble with the wildlings.
S02E02,The Night Lands,125,"That's why they're called ""wildlings."""
S02E02,The Night Lands,126,Somewhat less wild these days.
S02E02,The Night Lands,127,Seems they've stopped killing each other
S02E02,The Night Lands,128,and started following this king-beyond-the-Wall.
S02E02,The Night Lands,129,Another king? How many is that now?
S02E02,The Night Lands,130,Five?  I've lost count.
S02E02,The Night Lands,131,The Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man the Wall.
S02E02,The Night Lands,132,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
S02E02,The Night Lands,133,"""The cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them."""
S02E02,The Night Lands,134,The northerners are a superstitious people.
S02E02,The Night Lands,135,"According to the Commander,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,136,one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers.
S02E02,The Night Lands,137,Mormont doesn't lie.
S02E02,The Night Lands,138,How do you kill a dead man?
S02E02,The Night Lands,139,Apparently you burn him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,140,One trip to the Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks.
S02E02,The Night Lands,141,"I don't know what I believe,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,142,but here's a fact for you:
S02E02,The Night Lands,143,the Night's Watch is the only thing
S02E02,The Night Lands,144,that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.
S02E02,The Night Lands,145,I have every confidence that the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
S02E02,The Night Lands,146,"And I said, ""If the gods wanted us to have dignity,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,147,"""they wouldn't make us fart when we died."""
S02E02,The Night Lands,148,We fart when we die?
S02E02,The Night Lands,149,"My blessed mother,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,150,I was holding her hand when she left this world.
S02E02,The Night Lands,151,"She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
S02E02,The Night Lands,152,Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives.
S02E02,The Night Lands,153,Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
S02E02,The Night Lands,154,We were having a serious discussion.
S02E02,The Night Lands,155,Would you look at that?
S02E02,The Night Lands,156,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
S02E02,The Night Lands,157,I prefer watching them come towards me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,158,"I'm sure that's nice, too."
S02E02,The Night Lands,159,"Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up."
S02E02,The Night Lands,160,We were wrestling together from the time we were six years old.
S02E02,The Night Lands,161,And then we got older and the wrestling...
S02E02,The Night Lands,162,changed.
S02E02,The Night Lands,163,You were with her?
S02E02,The Night Lands,164,How many times?
S02E02,The Night Lands,165,"Well, as many times as I could."
S02E02,The Night Lands,166,I wish I grew up on a farm.
S02E02,The Night Lands,167,We need more potatoes. Get another sack from the sledge.
S02E02,The Night Lands,168,"Get the turnips, too."
S02E02,The Night Lands,169,"No. Ghost, no."
S02E02,The Night Lands,170,No!
S02E02,The Night Lands,171,"Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!"
S02E02,The Night Lands,172,You all right?
S02E02,The Night Lands,173,- Did he frighten you? - You shouldn't touch me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,174,Oh.
S02E02,The Night Lands,175,"Oh, right."
S02E02,The Night Lands,176,I'm sorry.
S02E02,The Night Lands,177,I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.
S02E02,The Night Lands,178,You're very brave.
S02E02,The Night Lands,179,What are you doing?
S02E02,The Night Lands,180,This is Gilly.
S02E02,The Night Lands,181,She's one of Craster's daughters.
S02E02,The Night Lands,182,"Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,183,Sam said you could help.
S02E02,The Night Lands,184,"I'm sorry, but Sam knows we're not supposed..."
S02E02,The Night Lands,185,She's pregnant.
S02E02,The Night Lands,186,We have to take her with us when we leave.
S02E02,The Night Lands,187,What?
S02E02,The Night Lands,188,- What would that... - I know it sounds a bit mad.
S02E02,The Night Lands,189,"No, it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
S02E02,The Night Lands,190,- The Lord Commander ordered us to... - We are sworn to protect.
S02E02,The Night Lands,191,"- Sam, we can't take... - Please, sir, please."
S02E02,The Night Lands,192,I can still run if I have to.
S02E02,The Night Lands,193,- It's just not possible. - I'm going to have a baby.
S02E02,The Night Lands,194,If it's a boy...
S02E02,The Night Lands,195,"If it's a boy, what?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,196,You want us to risk our lives for you and you won't even tell us why?
S02E02,The Night Lands,197,- Why'd you do that? - Do what? Ask her a question?
S02E02,The Night Lands,198,- You were cruel. - Cruel?
S02E02,The Night Lands,199,"Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,200,"- I didn't touch her. - No, you just want to steal her."
S02E02,The Night Lands,201,What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
S02E02,The Night Lands,202,"I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat."
S02E02,The Night Lands,203,We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory.
S02E02,The Night Lands,204,We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,205,"And even if he would, what would we do with her?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,206,"Who's going to deliver a baby, you?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,207,I could try.
S02E02,The Night Lands,208,What? I've read about it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,209,A bit.
S02E02,The Night Lands,210,"I'm sorry, Sam."
S02E02,The Night Lands,211,We can't help her.
S02E02,The Night Lands,212,Khaleesi.
S02E02,The Night Lands,213,- You don't need to see this. - He is blood of my blood.
S02E02,The Night Lands,214,"- Who did this? - Khal Pono, perhaps."
S02E02,The Night Lands,215,Khal Jhaqo.
S02E02,The Night Lands,216,They don't like the idea of a woman leading a khalasar.
S02E02,The Night Lands,217,They will like it far less when I am done with them.
S02E02,The Night Lands,218,They killed his soul!
S02E02,The Night Lands,219,Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
S02E02,The Night Lands,220,They did!
S02E02,The Night Lands,221,They butchered him like an animal.
S02E02,The Night Lands,222,They did not burn his body.
S02E02,The Night Lands,223,He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
S02E02,The Night Lands,224,Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
S02E02,The Night Lands,225,"And I promise you,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,226,Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
S02E02,The Night Lands,227,"Is it as you remember, my lord?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,228,It looks smaller.
S02E02,The Night Lands,229,Everything looks bigger when you're a child.
S02E02,The Night Lands,230,I remember my father's cabin felt like a palace when I was little.
S02E02,The Night Lands,231,Now look at it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,232,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
S02E02,The Night Lands,233,Who will?
S02E02,The Night Lands,234,Anyone who matters.
S02E02,The Night Lands,235,This is a big day for them.
S02E02,The Night Lands,236,They haven't had much to get excited about since I left.
S02E02,The Night Lands,237,"It's a hard place, the Iron Islands."
S02E02,The Night Lands,238,Always has been.
S02E02,The Night Lands,239,It's cold and it's wet.
S02E02,The Night Lands,240,"Oh, I love the cold and wet."
S02E02,The Night Lands,241,They say hard places breed hard men.
S02E02,The Night Lands,242,And hard men rule the world.
S02E02,The Night Lands,243,Then you'll be king before long.
S02E02,The Night Lands,244,Try smiling with your lips closed.
S02E02,The Night Lands,245,Better.
S02E02,The Night Lands,246,My father doesn't trust you Iron Islanders.
S02E02,The Night Lands,247,I don't blame him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,248,He says that you're all reavers and rapers
S02E02,The Night Lands,249,"and that no matter how many women you have,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,250,you'll never be sat...
S02E02,The Night Lands,251,Quit talking about your father.
S02E02,The Night Lands,252,But he's right about us.
S02E02,The Night Lands,253,"Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding."
S02E02,The Night Lands,254,That's not enough for us.
S02E02,The Night Lands,255,"That's why we take salt wives, the women we capture."
S02E02,The Night Lands,256,Capture me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,257,Take me with you when you go ashore.
S02E02,The Night Lands,258,- Make me your salt wife. - Your place is on this ship.
S02E02,The Night Lands,259,Not after you leave.
S02E02,The Night Lands,260,Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
S02E02,The Night Lands,261,I haven't paid you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,262,"Oh, yeah."
S02E02,The Night Lands,263,I paid good money...
S02E02,The Night Lands,264,I'm not going to stand for this.
S02E02,The Night Lands,265,I barely touched her.
S02E02,The Night Lands,266,"Now, you charge twice as much as every other brothel"
S02E02,The Night Lands,267,"and this is what I get, crying."
S02E02,The Night Lands,268,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
S02E02,The Night Lands,269,Please accept my sincerest apologies.
S02E02,The Night Lands,270,Aremca will take good care of you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,271,"I'm sorry, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,272,Did he hurt you?
S02E02,The Night Lands,273,"No, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,274,It's Mhaegen.
S02E02,The Night Lands,275,Who?
S02E02,The Night Lands,276,She works for you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,277,She's the one...
S02E02,The Night Lands,278,"The gold cloaks,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,279,"- they killed her baby. - Ah, yes."
S02E02,The Night Lands,280,That was...
S02E02,The Night Lands,281,poorly handled.
S02E02,The Night Lands,282,Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.
S02E02,The Night Lands,283,I can't stop thinking about it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,284,I can't sleep.
S02E02,The Night Lands,285,Her poor little baby.
S02E02,The Night Lands,286,"You know, you remind me of another girl,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,287,a lovely thing I once acquired from a Lysene pleasure house.
S02E02,The Night Lands,288,"Beautiful, like yourself,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,289,"and intelligent, like yourself."
S02E02,The Night Lands,290,But she wasn't happy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,291,She cried often.
S02E02,The Night Lands,292,"I asked her why,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,293,but we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have.
S02E02,The Night Lands,294,"Yes, it was quite sad."
S02E02,The Night Lands,295,"Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses are expensive,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,296,extremely expensive.
S02E02,The Night Lands,297,And this one wasn't making me any money.
S02E02,The Night Lands,298,I hate bad investments.
S02E02,The Night Lands,299,"Really, I do."
S02E02,The Night Lands,300,They haunt me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,301,"I had no idea how to make her happy,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,302,no idea how to mitigate my losses.
S02E02,The Night Lands,303,"A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money"
S02E02,The Night Lands,304,to let him transform
S02E02,The Night Lands,305,"this lovely, sad girl."
S02E02,The Night Lands,306,To use her in ways
S02E02,The Night Lands,307,that would never occur to most men.
S02E02,The Night Lands,308,But you know what occurs to most men.
S02E02,The Night Lands,309,"I would not say he succeeded in making her happy,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,310,but my losses were definitely mitigated.
S02E02,The Night Lands,311,Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.
S02E02,The Night Lands,312,I'll see you tomorrow.
S02E02,The Night Lands,313,And you'll be happy?
S02E02,The Night Lands,314,That makes me happy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,315,More wine?
S02E02,The Night Lands,316,"- Damn it, boy! - Apologies, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,317,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
S02E02,The Night Lands,318,That's your new squire?
S02E02,The Night Lands,319,I could've found you a proper lad.
S02E02,The Night Lands,320,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
S02E02,The Night Lands,321,That's a good red. Dornish?
S02E02,The Night Lands,322,"You know your wines, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,323,That I do.
S02E02,The Night Lands,324,"A fine dinner, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,325,"Call me Tyrion, please."
S02E02,The Night Lands,326,"I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,327,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
S02E02,The Night Lands,328,Wars have been started for less.
S02E02,The Night Lands,329,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
S02E02,The Night Lands,330,Mmm.
S02E02,The Night Lands,331,Nasty business.
S02E02,The Night Lands,332,"- Had to be done. - Yes, of course."
S02E02,The Night Lands,333,The City Watch must keep the peace.
S02E02,The Night Lands,334,"Only, I hadn't realised peace depended on killing babies."
S02E02,The Night Lands,335,- Orders are orders. - Quite right.
S02E02,The Night Lands,336,Especially the Queen's orders.
S02E02,The Night Lands,337,I never said they were the Queen's orders.
S02E02,The Night Lands,338,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,339,She's always been a jealous woman.
S02E02,The Night Lands,340,You know your sister better than I do.
S02E02,The Night Lands,341,You've heard the awful rumours about my brother and sister?
S02E02,The Night Lands,342,I don't listen to filth.
S02E02,The Night Lands,343,"That's good of you, but you have heard them."
S02E02,The Night Lands,344,I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards
S02E02,The Night Lands,345,to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.
S02E02,The Night Lands,346,Joffrey is my king. The rest doesn't interest me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,347,I appreciate your loyalty.
S02E02,The Night Lands,348,"Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men"
S02E02,The Night Lands,349,"in the throne room, did you give the order?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,350,I did.
S02E02,The Night Lands,351,And I would again.
S02E02,The Night Lands,352,The man was a traitor.
S02E02,The Night Lands,353,He tried to buy my loyalty.
S02E02,The Night Lands,354,The fool.
S02E02,The Night Lands,355,He had no idea you were already bought.
S02E02,The Night Lands,356,Are you drunk?
S02E02,The Night Lands,357,I'll not have my honour questioned by an imp!
S02E02,The Night Lands,358,"I'm not questioning your honour, Lord Janos."
S02E02,The Night Lands,359,I'm denying its existence.
S02E02,The Night Lands,360,"If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf..."
S02E02,The Night Lands,361,Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.
S02E02,The Night Lands,362,"And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,363,unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.
S02E02,The Night Lands,364,I intend to serve as Hand of the King
S02E02,The Night Lands,365,until my father returns from the war.
S02E02,The Night Lands,366,"And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,367,"well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
S02E02,The Night Lands,368,What are you...
S02E02,The Night Lands,369,My friends at court will not allow this!
S02E02,The Night Lands,370,- The Queen herself has granted... - The Queen Regent.
S02E02,The Night Lands,371,And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.
S02E02,The Night Lands,372,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
S02E02,The Night Lands,373,"No, we shan't."
S02E02,The Night Lands,374,There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.
S02E02,The Night Lands,375,"From there, I'm afraid, it's rather a long walk to Castle Black."
S02E02,The Night Lands,376,I hope you enjoy the Wall.
S02E02,The Night Lands,377,I found it surprisingly beautiful...
S02E02,The Night Lands,378,"in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
S02E02,The Night Lands,379,The lads will escort you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,380,"The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
S02E02,The Night Lands,381,These men are under my command!
S02E02,The Night Lands,382,I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
S02E02,The Night Lands,383,"His name is Bronn,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,384,and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
S02E02,The Night Lands,385,Boys.
S02E02,The Night Lands,386,"I have friends at court,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,387,powerful friends!
S02E02,The Night Lands,388,The king himself made me a lord!
S02E02,The Night Lands,389,To the new commander.
S02E02,The Night Lands,390,"If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,391,"still at her mother's breast,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,392,would you do it without question?
S02E02,The Night Lands,393,Without question? No.
S02E02,The Night Lands,394,"I'd ask, ""How much?"""
S02E02,The Night Lands,395,"If they come back, I say we yield."
S02E02,The Night Lands,396,Gendry's the one they want.
S02E02,The Night Lands,397,Don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.
S02E02,The Night Lands,398,I ain't afraid of no battles.
S02E02,The Night Lands,399,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
S02E02,The Night Lands,400,I've seen lots of battles.
S02E02,The Night Lands,401,- I saw... - Liar.
S02E02,The Night Lands,402,I saw a man kill another man
S02E02,The Night Lands,403,just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
S02E02,The Night Lands,404,Stabbed him right in the neck.
S02E02,The Night Lands,405,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
S02E02,The Night Lands,406,- They had armour on. - So?
S02E02,The Night Lands,407,"So, if they've got armour on, it's a battle."
S02E02,The Night Lands,408,"No, it isn't."
S02E02,The Night Lands,409,What does a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
S02E02,The Night Lands,410,Gendry's an armourer's apprentice.
S02E02,The Night Lands,411,"Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes a fight into a battle."
S02E02,The Night Lands,412,It's when they've got armour on.
S02E02,The Night Lands,413,Who told you that?
S02E02,The Night Lands,414,A knight.
S02E02,The Night Lands,415,How'd you know he was a knight?
S02E02,The Night Lands,416,"Well, it was 'cause he'd got armour on."
S02E02,The Night Lands,417,You don't have to be a knight to have armour.
S02E02,The Night Lands,418,Any idiot can buy armour.
S02E02,The Night Lands,419,How do you know?
S02E02,The Night Lands,420,'Cause I sold armour.
S02E02,The Night Lands,421,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
S02E02,The Night Lands,422,- No idea. - You're a liar.
S02E02,The Night Lands,423,"You know, you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you."
S02E02,The Night Lands,424,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.
S02E02,The Night Lands,425,I don't care what any of them want.
S02E02,The Night Lands,426,No good's ever come of their questions.
S02E02,The Night Lands,427,No good's ever come?
S02E02,The Night Lands,428,Who asked questions before?
S02E02,The Night Lands,429,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my arse?
S02E02,The Night Lands,430,Who asked questions?
S02E02,The Night Lands,431,The Hand of the King.
S02E02,The Night Lands,432,Hands of the King.
S02E02,The Night Lands,433,"Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,434,and then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died.
S02E02,The Night Lands,435,Lord Stark?
S02E02,The Night Lands,436,See? Asking me questions is bad luck.
S02E02,The Night Lands,437,You'll probably be dead soon.
S02E02,The Night Lands,438,- What did they ask about? - My mum.
S02E02,The Night Lands,439,"- Who's your mum? - Just my mum,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,440,"worked in a tavern, died when I was little."
S02E02,The Night Lands,441,And who was your father?
S02E02,The Night Lands,442,"Could've been one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know."
S02E02,The Night Lands,443,What about you anyway?
S02E02,The Night Lands,444,You thought they were after you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,445,Why?
S02E02,The Night Lands,446,Did you kill someone or is it just because you're a girl?
S02E02,The Night Lands,447,"- I'm not a girl. - Yes, you are."
S02E02,The Night Lands,448,Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
S02E02,The Night Lands,449,Stupider.
S02E02,The Night Lands,450,"The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
S02E02,The Night Lands,451,"- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl. - I am not!"
S02E02,The Night Lands,452,"Yeah? Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then."
S02E02,The Night Lands,453,I don't need to take a piss.
S02E02,The Night Lands,454,Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.
S02E02,The Night Lands,455,No one can know.
S02E02,The Night Lands,456,"Well, they won't. Not from me."
S02E02,The Night Lands,457,My name's not Arry.
S02E02,The Night Lands,458,"It's Arya, of House Stark."
S02E02,The Night Lands,459,Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
S02E02,The Night Lands,460,"He was your father, the Hand, the traitor."
S02E02,The Night Lands,461,He was never a traitor.
S02E02,The Night Lands,462,Joffrey is a liar.
S02E02,The Night Lands,463,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
S02E02,The Night Lands,464,"No. I mean, yes."
S02E02,The Night Lands,465,My mother was a lady and my sister...
S02E02,The Night Lands,466,"Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter, and you lived in a castle and you..."
S02E02,The Night Lands,467,"Look, all that about cocks, I should never have said..."
S02E02,The Night Lands,468,And I've been pissing in front of you and everything.
S02E02,The Night Lands,469,"I should be calling you ""my lady."""
S02E02,The Night Lands,470,"- Do not call me ""my lady."" - As my lady commands."
S02E02,The Night Lands,471,"Well, that was unladylike."
S02E02,The Night Lands,472,Oh!
S02E02,The Night Lands,473,What's she carrying?
S02E02,The Night Lands,474,"Myrish oranges,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,475,wine from the Arbor...
S02E02,The Night Lands,476,and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.
S02E02,The Night Lands,477,The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,478,Me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,479,I don't like wine.
S02E02,The Night Lands,480,Woman's drink.
S02E02,The Night Lands,481,I need to get to Pyke.
S02E02,The Night Lands,482,I'll find you a horse.
S02E02,The Night Lands,483,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
S02E02,The Night Lands,484,I bet you can.
S02E02,The Night Lands,485,Have you been at sea long?
S02E02,The Night Lands,486,Or were there just no women where you came from?
S02E02,The Night Lands,487,- None like you. - You don't know what I'm like.
S02E02,The Night Lands,488,Maybe you don't know what you're like.
S02E02,The Night Lands,489,Maybe you need someone to teach you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,490,Do you know who I am?
S02E02,The Night Lands,491,"You think I offer free rides to every man in jewellery,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,492,Lord Greyjoy?
S02E02,The Night Lands,493,Have my things sent up to the castle.
S02E02,The Night Lands,494,You should give me the reins.
S02E02,The Night Lands,495,I'm a better rider than you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,496,I've been on horseback for the past nine years.
S02E02,The Night Lands,497,Nine years?
S02E02,The Night Lands,498,Do you still know your way around a ship?
S02E02,The Night Lands,499,Have these hands ever touched a rope?
S02E02,The Night Lands,500,Don't you worry about my hands.
S02E02,The Night Lands,501,The sea is in my blood.
S02E02,The Night Lands,502,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
S02E02,The Night Lands,503,"I have a proposal for my father,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,504,"one that will make him king again,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,505,and me after him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,506,You may get to stay in a castle tonight if you're lucky.
S02E02,The Night Lands,507,Is that an offer from my future king?
S02E02,The Night Lands,508,An order from your future king.
S02E02,The Night Lands,509,You can tell your grandchildren about this night.
S02E02,The Night Lands,510,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
S02E02,The Night Lands,511,Father.
S02E02,The Night Lands,512,"Nine years, is it?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,513,They took a frightened boy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,514,What have they given back?
S02E02,The Night Lands,515,A man.
S02E02,The Night Lands,516,- Your blood and your heir. - We shall see.
S02E02,The Night Lands,517,Stark had you longer than I did.
S02E02,The Night Lands,518,Lord Stark is gone.
S02E02,The Night Lands,519,And how do you feel about that?
S02E02,The Night Lands,520,What's done is done.
S02E02,The Night Lands,521,I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
S02E02,The Night Lands,522,Who gave you those clothes?
S02E02,The Night Lands,523,Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
S02E02,The Night Lands,524,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
S02E02,The Night Lands,525,You will.
S02E02,The Night Lands,526,"That bauble round your neck,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,527,"did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,528,I asked a question.
S02E02,The Night Lands,529,Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made
S02E02,The Night Lands,530,or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?
S02E02,The Night Lands,531,Iron or gold?
S02E02,The Night Lands,532,Gold.
S02E02,The Night Lands,533,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.
S02E02,The Night Lands,534,"My fears have come true,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,535,the Starks have made you theirs.
S02E02,The Night Lands,536,- My blood is salt and iron. - Yet the Stark boy sends you to me
S02E02,The Night Lands,537,like a trained raven clutching his message.
S02E02,The Night Lands,538,The offer he makes is one I proposed.
S02E02,The Night Lands,539,"- He heeds your counsel? - I've lived with him,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,540,"hunted with him, fought at his side."
S02E02,The Night Lands,541,He thinks of me as a brother.
S02E02,The Night Lands,542,"No, not here, not in my hearing."
S02E02,The Night Lands,543,"You will not name him brother,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,544,this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.
S02E02,The Night Lands,545,Or have you forgotten your own blood?
S02E02,The Night Lands,546,I forget nothing.
S02E02,The Night Lands,547,I remember my brothers.
S02E02,The Night Lands,548,And I remember when my father was a king.
S02E02,The Night Lands,549,I see.
S02E02,The Night Lands,550,I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him
S02E02,The Night Lands,551,and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again.
S02E02,The Night Lands,552,"- I will lead the attack myself. - Oh, you will?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,553,"I'm your son, your only living heir."
S02E02,The Night Lands,554,Who else?
S02E02,The Night Lands,555,I told you to wait outside.
S02E02,The Night Lands,556,How did you get past the guards?
S02E02,The Night Lands,557,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
S02E02,The Night Lands,558,My dear.
S02E02,The Night Lands,559,Yara?
S02E02,The Night Lands,560,"So good to see you, brother."
S02E02,The Night Lands,561,This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.
S02E02,The Night Lands,562,- She can't lead an attack! - And why not?
S02E02,The Night Lands,563,You're a woman!
S02E02,The Night Lands,564,"- You're the one in skirts. - This isn't Winterfell, boy."
S02E02,The Night Lands,565,Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship
S02E02,The Night Lands,566,after your new father killed him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,567,- What's dead may never die. ...dead may never die.
S02E02,The Night Lands,568,The only nights she's spent off these islands have been spent on the sea.
S02E02,The Night Lands,569,She's commanded men.
S02E02,The Night Lands,570,She's killed men.
S02E02,The Night Lands,571,She knows who she is.
S02E02,The Night Lands,572,No man gives me a crown.
S02E02,The Night Lands,573,I pay the iron price.
S02E02,The Night Lands,574,"I will take my crown,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,575,for that is who I am.
S02E02,The Night Lands,576,That is who we have always been.
S02E02,The Night Lands,577,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
S02E02,The Night Lands,578,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
S02E02,The Night Lands,579,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
S02E02,The Night Lands,580,"All these kings fighting for the throne,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,581,and this Stannis has the smallest army.
S02E02,The Night Lands,582,Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?
S02E02,The Night Lands,583,Because you're a smart gambler.
S02E02,The Night Lands,584,Stannis has proved himself in war twice.
S02E02,The Night Lands,585,His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield.
S02E02,The Night Lands,586,Neither has the false King Joffrey.
S02E02,The Night Lands,587,And yet they both have larger armies.
S02E02,The Night Lands,588,Stannis has just begun the fight.
S02E02,The Night Lands,589,His bannermen will rally to his cause.
S02E02,The Night Lands,590,There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honourable than Stannis Baratheon
S02E02,The Night Lands,591,or more worthy of loyalty.
S02E02,The Night Lands,592,What is the world coming to
S02E02,The Night Lands,593,when smugglers must vouch for the honour of kings?
S02E02,The Night Lands,594,"- Mind your words, pirate. - Matthos."
S02E02,The Night Lands,595,You think I'm insulted?
S02E02,The Night Lands,596,I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.
S02E02,The Night Lands,597,I don't sail for promises.
S02E02,The Night Lands,598,Of course you do.
S02E02,The Night Lands,599,"Every time you leave harbour, you're leaving on a promise,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,600,"a promise that somewhere on the sea,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,601,somebody's got some gold and you can take it from him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,602,- That's a promise that always comes true. - As is mine.
S02E02,The Night Lands,603,"You're not a young man, Salladhor."
S02E02,The Night Lands,604,"And correct me if I'm wrong, most pirates don't grow old."
S02E02,The Night Lands,605,Only the clever ones.
S02E02,The Night Lands,606,You want to spend your last few years on the sea
S02E02,The Night Lands,607,"stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Myrenese silk merchants, then go."
S02E02,The Night Lands,608,They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.
S02E02,The Night Lands,609,What I'm offering you is hard.
S02E02,The Night Lands,610,Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros.
S02E02,The Night Lands,611,"You'll be the richest man in Lys, and the most famous."
S02E02,The Night Lands,612,They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.
S02E02,The Night Lands,613,"""Salladhor Saan"" is a good name for songs."
S02E02,The Night Lands,614,"- It is. - One thing, I want the queen."
S02E02,The Night Lands,615,"- The queen? - Cersei, I want her."
S02E02,The Night Lands,616,"I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships."
S02E02,The Night Lands,617,"And if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,618,I will fuck this blonde queen and I'll fuck her well.
S02E02,The Night Lands,619,This war isn't about you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,620,We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
S02E02,The Night Lands,621,I'm not going to rape her. I'm going to fuck her.
S02E02,The Night Lands,622,As if she would just let you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,623,You don't know how persuasive I am.
S02E02,The Night Lands,624,I've never tried to fuck you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,625,"Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,626,the one true god...
S02E02,The Night Lands,627,"I've been all over the world, my boy,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,628,"and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true gods."
S02E02,The Night Lands,629,They all think they found the right one.
S02E02,The Night Lands,630,"The one true god is what's between a woman's legs,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,631,"and better yet, a queen's legs."
S02E02,The Night Lands,632,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
S02E02,The Night Lands,633,He's young yet.
S02E02,The Night Lands,634,I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory.
S02E02,The Night Lands,635,I cannot promise you the queen.
S02E02,The Night Lands,636,You believe your king can win?
S02E02,The Night Lands,637,He is the one true king.
S02E02,The Night Lands,638,You Westerosi are funny people.
S02E02,The Night Lands,639,A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,640,"I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth."
S02E02,The Night Lands,641,You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.
S02E02,The Night Lands,642,Make me rich.
S02E02,The Night Lands,643,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
S02E02,The Night Lands,644,When will the king have us sail?
S02E02,The Night Lands,645,As soon as his god wills it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,646,"He's my god, too, and yours,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,647,but you are too blind to see.
S02E02,The Night Lands,648,"- Let me teach you how to read. - Oh, you and your mother."
S02E02,The Night Lands,649,It won't take long. You already know the letters.
S02E02,The Night Lands,650,The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
S02E02,The Night Lands,651,"I wish I had a god, truly."
S02E02,The Night Lands,652,"I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every god there is,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,653,"pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home."
S02E02,The Night Lands,654,- None of it works. - But you always came home.
S02E02,The Night Lands,655,I wasn't praying.
S02E02,The Night Lands,656,But I was.
S02E02,The Night Lands,657,"Every night that you were at sea,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,658,I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,659,You want me to have a god?
S02E02,The Night Lands,660,Fine. King Stannis is my god.
S02E02,The Night Lands,661,He raised me up and blessed me with his trust.
S02E02,The Night Lands,662,He gave you a future I could never have imagined.
S02E02,The Night Lands,663,You know how to read. You'll be a knight someday.
S02E02,The Night Lands,664,You think a fire god commanded all that?
S02E02,The Night Lands,665,"It was Stannis, only Stannis."
S02E02,The Night Lands,666,"Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
S02E02,The Night Lands,667,Don't tell him that.
S02E02,The Night Lands,668,Lord Janos Slynt was commander of the City Watch.
S02E02,The Night Lands,669,You had no right to exile him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,670,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
S02E02,The Night Lands,671,You're serving as the King's Hand till Father gets here.
S02E02,The Night Lands,672,I am Queen Regent.
S02E02,The Night Lands,673,"Listen to me, Queen Regent."
S02E02,The Night Lands,674,You're losing the people.
S02E02,The Night Lands,675,- Do you hear me? -  The people.
S02E02,The Night Lands,676,You think I care?
S02E02,The Night Lands,677,You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.
S02E02,The Night Lands,678,Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,679,"And your gold-plated thugs just gave them their rallying cry,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,680,"""The Queen slaughters babies."""
S02E02,The Night Lands,681,You don't even have the decency to deny it.
S02E02,The Night Lands,682,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,683,Joffrey didn't even tell you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,684,Did he tell you?
S02E02,The Night Lands,685,I imagine that would be even worse.
S02E02,The Night Lands,686,He did what needed to be done.
S02E02,The Night Lands,687,You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule?
S02E02,The Night Lands,688,"This is what ruling is, lying on a bed of weeds,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,689,"ripping them out by the root, one by one,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,690,before they strangle you in your sleep.
S02E02,The Night Lands,691,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that."
S02E02,The Night Lands,692,I don't care what you think!
S02E02,The Night Lands,693,You've never taken it seriously.
S02E02,The Night Lands,694,"You haven't, Jaime hasn't."
S02E02,The Night Lands,695,It's all fallen on me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,696,"As has Jaime, repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
S02E02,The Night Lands,697,You're funny.
S02E02,The Night Lands,698,You've always been funny...
S02E02,The Night Lands,699,"but none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they?"
S02E02,The Night Lands,700,You remember?
S02E02,The Night Lands,701,Back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her
S02E02,The Night Lands,702,and she bled to death?
S02E02,The Night Lands,703,"She was my mother, too."
S02E02,The Night Lands,704,Mother gone...
S02E02,The Night Lands,705,for the sake of you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,706,There's no bigger joke in the world than that.
S02E02,The Night Lands,707,- Your Grace. - Your Grace.
S02E02,The Night Lands,708,How did you fare with your pirate?
S02E02,The Night Lands,709,"Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships."
S02E02,The Night Lands,710,His men know how to fight.
S02E02,The Night Lands,711,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
S02E02,The Night Lands,712,It does seem the wiser choice.
S02E02,The Night Lands,713,There won't be a choice this time.
S02E02,The Night Lands,714,Do you trust him?
S02E02,The Night Lands,715,Salladhor Saan is an old friend. I've known him 30 years.
S02E02,The Night Lands,716,I've never trusted him.
S02E02,The Night Lands,717,"Now, once he gets the smell of gold he never stops."
S02E02,The Night Lands,718,"Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share."
S02E02,The Night Lands,719,Leave us.
S02E02,The Night Lands,720,"At once, Your Grace."
S02E02,The Night Lands,721,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
S02E02,The Night Lands,722,Come.
S02E02,The Night Lands,723,What did you say to him?
S02E02,The Night Lands,724,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
S02E02,The Night Lands,725,- Why? - Because it is true.
S02E02,The Night Lands,726,"You're troubled, my king."
S02E02,The Night Lands,727,Yeah.
S02E02,The Night Lands,728,These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.
S02E02,The Night Lands,729,"Tell your lord to burn them, then."
S02E02,The Night Lands,730,I tell him nothing.
S02E02,The Night Lands,731,I pray for his commands and I obey.
S02E02,The Night Lands,732,"My little brother has 100,000 men, according to the scouts,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,733,men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
S02E02,The Night Lands,734,You must have faith.
S02E02,The Night Lands,735,Faith?
S02E02,The Night Lands,736,"In a real war, the side with the greater number wins,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,737,nine times out of ten.
S02E02,The Night Lands,738,Then we must be the 10th.
S02E02,The Night Lands,739,I cannot defeat my brother in the field.
S02E02,The Night Lands,740,And I can't take King's Landing without the men he's stolen.
S02E02,The Night Lands,741,I have seen the path to victory in the flames.
S02E02,The Night Lands,742,"But first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
S02E02,The Night Lands,743,"I've said the words, damn you."
S02E02,The Night Lands,744,I burned the idols.
S02E02,The Night Lands,745,You must give all of yourself.
S02E02,The Night Lands,746,I have a wife.
S02E02,The Night Lands,747,I took a vow.
S02E02,The Night Lands,748,"She's sickly, weak..."
S02E02,The Night Lands,749,Shut away in a tower.
S02E02,The Night Lands,750,She disgusts you.
S02E02,The Night Lands,751,"And she's given you nothing,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,752,"no sons, only stillborns,"
S02E02,The Night Lands,753,only death.
S02E02,The Night Lands,754,"I will give you a son, my king."
S02E02,The Night Lands,755,A son?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,1,"Out, all of you."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,2,This bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,3,I want you and your men
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,4,gone.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,5,And you will make this right.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,6,Wait outside.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,7,- Lord Commander... - Now!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,8,- Lord Commander... - Leave us.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,9,What did you do?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,10,I followed him.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,11,"He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,12,What business is that of yours?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,13,"No, you don't understand."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,14,"He's killing them, all the boys."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,15,You know.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,16,Wildlings serve crueller gods than you or I.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,17,Those boys are Craster's offerings.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,18,Offerings?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,19,He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,20,"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,21,"between life and death for our rangers,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,22,your uncle among them.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,23,We have other wars to fight out there.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,24,"Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,25,I...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,26,I saw it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,27,I saw
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,28,something take that child.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,29,"Yeah. Whatever it was,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,30,I daresay you'll see it again.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,31,"Now, ready my horse."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,32,We leave at dawn.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,33,Don't lose it again.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,34,Gilly.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,35,You're leaving.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,36,I... I wanted to give you something.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,37,It belonged to my mother.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,38,- I can't take it. - Please.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,39,I want you to.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,40,My mother used it for sewing.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,41,She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,42,and I'd read to her.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,43,My father put a stop to it when he found out.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,44,It's the only thing I have of hers.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,45,She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,46,You...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,47,You shouldn't give it away.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,48,I'm not giving it away.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,49,I'm giving it to you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,50,Keep it safe for me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,51,Till I come back.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,52,Hodor.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,53,Hodor.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,54,"Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,55,Every night it's the same.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,56,I'm walking
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,57,"and running, but..."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,58,I'm not... I'm not me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,59,"I'm running through the godswood,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,60,"sniffing the dirt,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,61,"tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,62,howling.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,63,Old Nan used to tell me stories
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,64,about magical people who could live
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,65,"inside stags, birds,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,66,wolves.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,67,"That's exactly what they are, Bran,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,68,- stories. - So she was lying?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,69,"- They don't exist? - Well, they may have done."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,70,"But they're gone from the world,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,71,along with much else.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,72,"These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,73,"No, my dreams are different."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,74,Mine are true.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,75,I dreamt of my father dying.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,76,And Rickon had the same dream.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,77,What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,78,Hmm?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,79,Right.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,80,This link is made of Valyrian steel.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,81,Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,82,It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,83,And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,84,I was no different.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,85,I was young.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,86,And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,87,to lift him out of his dull life into a special one?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,88,"But in the end, for all my efforts,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,89,I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,90,Come on.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,91,All right.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,92,Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,93,But not any more.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,94,The dragons are gone.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,95,The giants are dead.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,96,And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,97,Loras! Highgarden!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,98,Get him!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,99,Oh!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,100,Yield! I yield.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,101,Well fought. Approach.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,102,Rise. Remove your helm.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,103,"You are all your father promised and more, my lady."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,104,"I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,105,but never quite in that fashion.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,106,"Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,107,"That he did, my queen."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,108,But there can only be one champion.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,109,"Brienne of Tarth,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,110,you may ask anything of me you desire.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,111,"If it is within my power, it is yours."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,112,"Your Grace,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,113,I ask the honour of a place in your Kingsguard.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,114,What?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,115,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,116,and keep you safe from all harm.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,117,Done.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,118,"Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,119,"Your Grace, I have the honour to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,120,"sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,121,Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,122,Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,123,"May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,124,"You are very welcome here, Lady Stark."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,125,I'm so sorry for your loss.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,126,You are most kind.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,127,"My lady,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,128,I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,129,"When I take King's Landing,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,130,I'll bring you Joffrey's head.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,131,"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,132,Your Grace.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,133,And you should kneel when you approach the king.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,134,There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honoured guest.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,135,Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,136,I do not sit on my son's war councils.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,137,"And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,138,"If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,139,not hide behind his mother's skirts.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,140,"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,141,"Don't worry, my lady."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,142,Our war is just beginning.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,143,- Your Grace. - Gerard.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,144,"- How's your foot? - Better, Your Grace."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,145,They don't know their own size is all.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,146,Good man.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,147,"I have 100,000 men at my command."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,148,All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,149,And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,150,"It's a game to you, isn't it?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,151,- I pity them. - Why?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,152,Because it won't last.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,153,Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,154,"Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,155,"- She's tired from her journey. - At once, Your Grace."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,156,- Shall I return after? - That won't be necessary.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,157,I would pray awhile. Alone.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,158,"If you'll follow me, my lady."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,159,"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,160,I fought for my king.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,161,Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,162,Die for him if I must.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,163,"And, if it please you, Brienne's enough."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,164,I'm no lady.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,165,What are you doing here?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,166,I live here.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,167,"Are you angry with me, brother?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,168,You lying bitch.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,169,It's not my fault you didn't recognise me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,170,Recognise you? How could I?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,171,The last time I saw you...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,172,you looked like a fat little boy.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,173,"You were a fat little boy, too,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,174,but I recognised you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,175,Why didn't you tell me?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,176,I wanted to see who you were first.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,177,And I did.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,178,The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,179,- Father. - Father.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,180,The wolf pup has gone south
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,181,with the entirety of the Northern army at his back.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,182,"While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,183,the North is ripe for the taking.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,184,"The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,185,all along the northern coast.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,186,"We'll spread our dominion across the green lands,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,187,securing the Neck and everything above.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,188,"Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,189,"Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,190,"The rest shall be ours,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,191,"forest, field, and hall."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,192,"Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,193,to attack Deepwood Motte.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,194,I've always wanted a castle.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,195,And what's my role in all this?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,196,You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,197,A ship?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,198,You give her 30 and I get one?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,199,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,200,I'm to fight fishermen?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,201,Be careful of their nets.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,202,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,203,- He won't give up the North so easily. - They won't even know we're there
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,204,"- until it's too late. - What do you know of it, woman?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,205,I'm a proven warrior.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,206,"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,207,at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,208,I'm not protecting anyone.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,209,I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,210,Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,211,Rise up against them and they could destroy us.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,212,"But if we pledge fealty to them,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,213,they'll give us Casterly Rock.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,214,What are our words?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,215,Our words?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,216,- We do not sow. - We do not sow.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,217,We are ironborn.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,218,We're not subjects. We're not slaves.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,219,We do not plough the fields or toil in the mine.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,220,We take what is ours.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,221,Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,222,You act as if I volunteered to go.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,223,"You gave me away, if you remember."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,224,The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,225,After he crushed you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,226,Did you take what was yours then?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,227,You gave me away!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,228,Your boy!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,229,Your last boy!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,230,You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want any more.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,231,And now you curse me because I've come home.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,232,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,233,I have no other family.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,234,Don't you?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,235,"Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,236,Our ships sail with or without you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,237,You won't let me leave this room.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,238,- You won't let me... -  Keep your voice down.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,239,Why? You think your father can hear me?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,240,He's 300 miles away!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,241,I don't intend for you to stay here.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,242,I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,243,"Again, only temporary."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,244,Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,245,But you wouldn't be a cook.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,246,You'd pose as a scullion.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,247,Scullion? What is a scullion?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,248,Kitchen wench.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,249,"- A kitchen wench? - Yes, but..."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,250,Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,251,Your lion wants to see you alive.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,252,We've come to a dangerous place.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,253,My sister wants to hurt me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,254,She'll look for any weakness she can find.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,255,She can't know about you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,256,I'm the weakness?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,257,"It's a compliment, my lady."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,258,How is being a weakness a compliment?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,259,Language can be a bit tricky here.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,260,Oh.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,261,I'm too stupid to understand.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,262,The stupid foreign girl.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,263,I am not a kitchen wench.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,264,When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,265,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,266,Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,267,and another for the feast.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,268,"But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,269,The Princess just spoke to you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,270,"Pardon, Your Grace."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,271,"I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,272,I'm counting the days until the fighting is done
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,273,and I can pledge my love to the king in sight of the gods.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,274,Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,275,He might.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,276,Would you like that?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,277,No. I don't think so.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,278,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,279,"Won't you, little dove?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,280,Come in.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,281,Who are you?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,282,"I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,283,I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,284,- You're not from here. - No.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,285,What are you doing?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,286,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,287,I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,288,What things?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,289,"Change my linens, wash my clothing,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,290,"scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,291,- No. - You said to brush...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,292,Not now.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,293,Your chamber pot is empty.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,294,Clean the table.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,295,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,296,- Yes. - For whom?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,297,- Lady Zuriff. - Lady Zuriff?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,298,Lady Zuriff.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,299,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,300,She wasn't in this city.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,301,"I don't know how they did things in that city,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,302,"but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,303,not the other way around.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,304,And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,305,and teach you how to do your job.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,306,Do you want me to leave?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,307,Just brush my hair.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,308,Oh!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,309,Thank the gods.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,310,I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,311,"I've encountered this problem before, my lord."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,312,The stresses of power often have this
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,313,insalubrious effect.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,314,"Two drops with water, daily."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,315,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,316,of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,317,"- Please. - Thank you, my lord."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,318,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,319,"Why, yes, of course, my lord."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,320,These are perilous times.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,321,And the crown must forge new alliances.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,322,And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,323,"Matrimony, huh?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,324,Yes.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,325,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,326,We can't have her meddling in affairs
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,327,that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,328,"Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,329,I shall be silent as the grave.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,330,I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,331,"Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,332,ensuring their loyalty
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,333,"and their army, should we need it."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,334,Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,335,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,336,Ooh.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,337,"""The Queen mustn't know."""
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,338,I love conversations that begin this way.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,339,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,340,to Theon Greyjoy.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,341,Theon Greyjoy?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,342,"Forgive me, my lord, but how?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,343,He grew up a ward of Winterfell.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,344,- He fights for Robb Stark. - Precisely.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,345,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,346,Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,347,and we can have his father's ships.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,348,"But remember, you must tell no one."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,349,Tell no one what?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,350,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,351,Lysa is not fond of me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,352,But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,353,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,354,And you offer her son a princess?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,355,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,356,"an encumbrance, don't you think?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,357,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,358,Who better?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,359,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,360,What's in it for me?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,361,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,362,the adoration of the king for bringing the Vale back into the fold...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,363,and Harrenhal.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,364,Harrenhal is cursed.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,365,Never took you for a superstitious man.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,366,"By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,367,I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,368,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,369,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,370,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,371,Until you snatched it away.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,372,I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,373,I didn't need Janos Slynt.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,374,"It's settled, then?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,375,Good.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,376,Oh. And remember...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,377,The Queen mustn't know.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,378,That must hurt.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,379,What?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,380,What is it?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,381,A member of the Kingsguard?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,382,As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,383,Brienne is a very capable warrior.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,384,And she's devoted to me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,385,You're jealous.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,386,Jealous?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,387,Of Brienne the Beauty?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,388,Don't make me laugh.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,389,"- I'll make it up to you. - No, Your Grace."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,390,Not tonight.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,391,There's another Tyrell who requires your attention.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,392,You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,393,Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,394,Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,395,And Margaery's a virgin?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,396,Officially.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,397,Shall I bring her to you?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,398,"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,399,As is your right. You are a king.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,400,You look very beautiful.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,401,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,402,- It's a lovely gown. - You think so?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,403,I can't decide how I like it better.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,404,"This way,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,405,or this way.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,406,You certainly don't need it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,407,"Although, some say the beauty most desired"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,408,is the beauty concealed.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,409,Must be the wine.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,410,"Here, let me."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,411,I'm sorry.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,412,Do you want my brother to come in and help?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,413,- What? - He could get you started.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,414,I know he wouldn't mind.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,415,Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,416,I don't know what you're talking about.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,417,There's no need for us to play games.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,418,Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,419,Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,420,And the best way to stop them
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,421,is to put your baby
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,422,in my belly.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,423,We can try again later.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,424,"You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,425,however else you like.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,426,Whatever you need to do.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,427,You are a king.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,428,You monster.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,429,Myrcella is my only daughter.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,430,Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,431,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,432,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,433,Dorne is the safest place for her.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,434,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,435,That's why we need to seduce them.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,436,We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,437,- She'll be a hostage. - A guest.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,438,You won't get away with this.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,439,You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,440,"Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,441,"- It's done, Cersei. - No."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,442,- You cannot stop it. - No!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,443,Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,444,"Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,445,Make no mistake.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,446,They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,447,Get out! Get out!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,448,"Theon of the House Greyjoy,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,449,you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,450,- I would. - Kneel.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,451,"Let Theon, your servant,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,452,be born again from the sea as you were.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,453,Bless him with salt.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,454,Bless him with stone.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,455,Bless him with steel.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,456,What is dead may never die.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,457,What is dead may never die.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,458,But rises again harder and stronger.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,459,Stand.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,460,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,461,"If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,462,"she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,463,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,464,"And Harrenhal,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,465,I suppose that's off the table as well.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,466,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,467,Leave me out of your next deception.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,468,That's a shame.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,469,You were to be the centrepiece of my next deception.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,470,My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,471,I would see him released. That's where you come in.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,472,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,473,"No, he won't. But his mother might."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,474,How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,475,"- Find him? - Oh, aye."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,476,And he has company.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,477,Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,478,"No, you don't."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,479,"No, I don't."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,480,What is the meaning of this?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,481,"No, please, please."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,482,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,483,I am your loyal servant.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,484,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,485,No! Never!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,486,It's a falsehood. I swear it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,487,It wasn't me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,488,"Ah, Varys."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,489,It was Varys the Spider.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,490,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,491,I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,492,I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,493,No one but you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,494,The eunuch has spies everywhere.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,495,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,496,"- No, no, no. - There are no goats, halfman."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,497,"Well, make do."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,498,How long have you been spying for my sister?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,499,"All I did, I did for House Lannister."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,500,"Always. Your lord father, ask him."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,501,I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,502,- I don't like his beard. - What?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,503,What? No. No.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,504,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,505,Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,506,"Lord Arryn, he knew."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,507,He knew the truth about the Queen.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,508,"And... he planned to act, to tell King Robert."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,509,So you poisoned him?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,510,No. Never.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,511,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,512,Lannister... I always served Lannister.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,513,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,514,"No. No, no, no. No, please."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,515,Don't! You can't do this to me!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,516,For your trouble.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,517,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,518,is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,519,Good. One of my better ideas.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,520,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,521,"Well played, My Lord Hand."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,522,But should I be worried?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,523,"Janos Slynt, Pycelle..."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,524,The Small Council grows smaller every day.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,525,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,526,I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,527,"Power is a curious thing, my lord."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,528,Are you fond of riddles?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,529,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,530,Three great men sit in a room.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,531,"A king, a priest and a rich man."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,532,Between them stands a common sellsword.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,533,Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,534,"Who lives, who dies?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,535,Depends on the sellsword.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,536,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favour with the gods.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,537,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,538,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,539,"When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,540,Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,541,I've decided I don't like riddles.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,542,Power resides where men believe it resides.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,543,"It's a trick, a shadow on the wall."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,544,And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,545,You should be sleeping.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,546,Tomorrow's a long march.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,547,"Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,548,I can't sleep.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,549,I don't like the taste.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,550,"You don't drink it for the flavour, to be honest."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,551,What?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,552,How do you sleep?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,553,"Same as most men, I think."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,554,"But you've seen things,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,555,horrible things.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,556,Aye.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,557,"I've seen some pretty things, too,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,558,but not nearly so many.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,559,How do you sleep when you...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,560,When you have those things in your head?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,561,You didn't see that.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,562,I made damn sure.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,563,I close my eyes and I see them up there.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,564,All of them
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,565,standing there.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,566,"Joffrey,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,567,the Queen and...
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,568,and my sister.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,569,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,570,You know that?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,571,I must have been
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,572,a couple of years older than you.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,573,I saw my brother stabbed through the heart
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,574,right on our doorstep.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,575,He weren't much of a villain what skewered him.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,576,"Willem, the lad's name was."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,577,He ran off before anyone could spit.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,578,"And I just stood there,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,579,watching my brother die.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,580,Here's the funny part.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,581,I can't picture my brother's face any more.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,582,"But Willem,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,583,"oh, he was a nice-looking boy."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,584,"He had good white teeth, blue eyes,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,585,one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,586,"I would think about him when I was working,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,587,"when I was drinking, when I was having a shit."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,588,It got to the point
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,589,where I would say his name every night before I went to bed.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,590,Willem. Willem.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,591,Willem.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,592,A prayer almost.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,593,"Well, one day,"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,594,Willem came riding back into town.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,595,I buried an axe so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,596,Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,597,"That'll help you sleep, eh?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,598,Ho!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,599,"Get up, you lazy sons of whores!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,600,Arm yourselves.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,601,- Get up. - Get up.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,602,"Keep out of sight, both of you."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,603,"- No, I'm not afraid. - I can fight."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,604,Keep out of sight.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,605,"If things go wrong, you run."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,606,Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,607,"Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,608,"Outside, now!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,609,"Come on, move, move!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,610,Gold cloaks!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,611,Everyone out!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,612,"Hey, you! Open the damn cage!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,613,"Where's the bastard, crow?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,614,Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,615,"Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,616,These men from the capital requested our assistance.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,617,Drop your weapons in the name of the king.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,618,"Now, which king would that be?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,619,This is your last chance.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,620,"In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,621,I don't think I will.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,622,So be it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,623,I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,624,"Boy, come here. Boy!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,625,"- Sweet boy, help us. - Come back here!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,626,"Help us, boy!"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,627,A man can fight! Free us!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,628,"Quick, give it to me."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,629,Give me the axe. Give me that.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,630,Put them on the wagon!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,631,There's more here. Come on.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,632,What do we have here?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,633,No!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,634,That's a fine little blade.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,635,Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,636,I yield! I yield!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,637,Round up any survivors.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,638,We'll take them back to Harrenhal.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,639,You heard him. You're coming with us.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,640,I yield!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,641,Help!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,642,Help me!
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,643,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,644,Look at it.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,645,Can you walk?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,646,No. You got to carry me.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,647,All right.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,648,"""Carry him,"" he says."
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,649,We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,650,Give him up
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,651,or I'll start taking eyeballs.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,652,You want Gendry?
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,653,You already got him.
S02E03,What Is Dead May Never Die,654,He loved that helmet.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,1,It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,2,- He's the strongest. - Bulls are bigger than lions.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,3,Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,4,"If the bull had fangs and claws, I would."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,5,"Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,6,If he ever gets out.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,7,Loras Tyrell?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,8,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the queen.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,9,I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,10,How good could he be?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,11,"He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,12,The horses seem a little spooked to you?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,13,They're horses.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,14,They get spooked by their own shadows.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,15,Do you hear that?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,16,No.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,17,There's something out there.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,18,Oh.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,19,"Oh, you're a right little prick."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,20,You should see your face.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,21,I swear you pissed yourself.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,22,"""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,23,There is something out there.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,24,"Yeah, don't even try me."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,25,- Rennick. - Do you think I'm an idiot?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,26,Rennick!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,27,- King in the North! - The King in the North!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,28,Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,29,They're dead. Take everything they've got.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,30,We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,31,Barely enough food to feed our own.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,32,"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,33,"Of course, Your Grace."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,34,The officers will be useful.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,35,Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,36,I doubt it.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,37,"Well, we'll learn soon enough."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,38,"In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,39,"""A flayed man none."""
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,40,My father outlawed flaying in the North.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,41,- We're not in the North. - We're not torturing them.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,42,"The high road's very pretty,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,43,but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,44,The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,45,I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,46,"No, don't! Don't! Please!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,47,The rot's set in.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,48,"No, don't! No, don't!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,49,"- Shh. - Please, don't!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,50,It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,51,The rot will spread. If we don't take the foot now...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,52,"No, you can't!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,53,"Ser! Please, ser."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,54,- I can't lose... - You'll die if she doesn't.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,55,"I don't want to be a cripple, please."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,56,Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,57,"Your men are not my men, my lord."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,58,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,59,- No! You can't! - Bite on it.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,60,"It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,61,- What's your name? - Talisa.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,62,Your last name?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,63,You want to know what side my family fights on?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,64,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,65,That boy lost his foot on your orders.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,66,They killed my father.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,67,- That boy did? - The family he fights for.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,68,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,69,He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,70,He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,71,I have no hatred for the lad.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,72,That should help his foot grow back.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,73,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,74,I understand. The country would be at peace
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,75,and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,76,- You're going to kill Joffrey? - If the gods give me strength.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,77,- And then what? - I don't know.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,78,We'll go back to Winterfell.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,79,I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,80,So who will?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,81,I don't know.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,82,"You're fighting to overthrow a king,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,83,and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,84,First we have to win the war.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,85,You never told me where you're from.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,86,- Volantis. - Volantis? You're far from home.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,87,The boy was lucky you were here.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,88,He was unlucky that you were.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,89,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,90,"Your Grace,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,91,"whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,92,"You know that. I beg you, please..."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,93,"Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,94,"Using some vile sorcery,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,95,your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,96,Thousands of good men were butchered.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,97,"After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,98,Killing you would send your brother a message.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,99,But my mother insists on keeping you alive.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,100,Stand.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,101,So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,102,Meryn.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,103,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,104,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,105,Unburden her.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,106,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,107,What is the meaning of this?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,108,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,109,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,110,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,111,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,112,She is to be your queen.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,113,Have you no regard for her honour?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,114,- I'm punishing her. - For what crimes?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,115,"She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,116,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,117,The Mad King did as he liked.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,118,Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,119,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,120,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,121,"Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,122,That was a threat. See the difference?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,123,I apologise for my nephew's behaviour.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,124,Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,125,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,126,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,127,The little king's backed up.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,128,Clogged from balls to brains.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,129,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,130,There's no cure for being a cunt.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,131,But the boy's at that age.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,132,And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,133,Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,134,"What are you doing here, dog?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,135,Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,136,And?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,137,What is it?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,138,"Look inside, Your Grace."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,139,Your Grace.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,140,"- Happy nameday, Your Grace. - My nameday has passed."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,141,We won't tell if you won't.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,142,No.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,143,Her.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,144,Touch her.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,145,Could you hit her?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,146,My uncle sent you?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,147,"Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,148,Hmm.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,149,Use this.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,150,Harder.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,151,I said harder.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,152,He'd want me to get his money's worth.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,153,"Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,154,"Please, Your Grace."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,155,"Your Grace, if your uncle finds out..."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,156,"Oh, I want him to find out."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,157,You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,158,"and show him what you've done,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,159,or the same thing will happen to you.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,160,Begin.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,161,Harder!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,162,"Well, if it isn't my favourite whoremonger."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,163,Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,164,Your Grace.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,165,"Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,166,"Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,167,I'm a practical man.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,168,Just not a loyal one.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,169,And who would you have me be loyal to?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,170,Your brother's corpse?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,171,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,172,I don't like your face.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,173,I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,174,I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,175,"So tell me, why are you here?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,176,You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,177,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,178,many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,179,Now I understand.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,180,You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,181,"When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,182,And your head.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,183,I would give priority to my head.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,184,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,185,I did not come here today seeking your affection.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,186,"When you march on King's Landing,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,187,you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,188,open gates.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,189,Your Grace.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,190,Lord Baelish.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,191,All of these tents look the same to me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,192,- Would you be so kind... - It would be my pleasure.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,193,It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,194,Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,195,"And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,196,"""Your tent""?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,197,"Not ""Our tent""?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,198,"The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,199,"Pressures of command, no doubt."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,200,Four kings vying for the throne.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,201,"I am not tutored in warfare,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,202,but basic arithmetic favours the side with the greater numbers.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,203,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,204,I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,205,The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,206,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,207,You seem quite interested in our marriage.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,208,Your marriage is quite interesting.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,209,"Not only to me, but to the realm."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,210,"The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,211,"You've never married, have you?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,212,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,213,That is sad.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,214,Though perhaps it's for the best.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,215,"The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,216,so allow me to explain.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,217,"My husband is my king, and my king is my husband."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,218,"Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,219,This isn't your horse.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,220,It was given to me by the Thirteen.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,221,The Elders of Qarth.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,222,Qarth?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,223,"Three days to the east, on the sea."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,224,Will they let us in?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,225,They said they would be honoured to receive the Mother of Dragons.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,226,What do you know of this place?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,227,Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,228,"Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveller,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,229,the garden grows.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,230,"- Go on! - You, keep moving!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,231,Bring her about!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,232,What kind of fire melts stone?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,233,Dragon fire.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,234,There's dragons here?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,235,"No, all the dragons are dead."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,236,What's that smell?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,237,Dead people.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,238,Move.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,239,"Please, please, no, no!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,240,No.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,241,He's dead.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,242,He was my son.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,243,My sister was three days ago.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,244,"My husband, the day before that."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,245,They take someone every day?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,246,Does anyone live?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,247,Joffrey.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,248,Cersei.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,249,Ilyn Payne.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,250,The Hound.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,251,Joffrey.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,252,Cersei.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,253,Ilyn Payne.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,254,The Hound.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,255,Joffrey. Cersei.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,256,Ilyn Payne. The Hound.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,257,How dare you?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,258,You may have heard false reports.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,259,- You betrayed Ned. - Betrayed?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,260,I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,261,I begged him to seize the moment.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,262,I trusted you. My husband trusted you.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,263,And you repaid our faith with treachery.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,264,"- No, my lady. - Get out!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,265,"Cat, I've..."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,266,I've loved you since I was a boy.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,267,It seems to me that fate has given us this chance...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,268,Have you lost your mind? Get out!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,269,Do you want to see your girls again?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,270,"Sansa, more beautiful than ever?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,271,"And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,272,"You have Arya, too?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,273,Both girls are healthy and safe.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,274,For now.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,275,But you know the queen and you know Joffrey.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,276,I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,277,What do you want?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,278,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,279,Of course they will.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,280,Jaime Lannister for two girls?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,281,Robb will never agree to those terms.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,282,I'm not bringing these terms to him.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,283,I'm bringing them to you.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,284,You think I keep secrets from my son?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,285,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,286,but he's not a mother.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,287,"Consider it, Cat."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,288,You may not get another chance.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,289,- I've brought you a gift. - I don't want your gifts.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,290,A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,291,He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,292,is offered in good faith.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,293,Good faith?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,294,What's this?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,295,Your husband was an honourable man.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,296,He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,297,- You may not believe... - Get out.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,298,"Get up, you dogs!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,299,"That's him, the one who picks."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,300,The Mountain.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,301,What are you doing?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,302,He told me he stares at him every day.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,303,That's why he doesn't get picked.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,304,You.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,305,"Move, boy!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,306,Move!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,307,Is there gold and silver in the village?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,308,- I don't know. - Gems?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,309,I didn't see any.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,310,- Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,311,- Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know. Please.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,312,- Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,313,Which of the villagers aided them?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,314,- I don't know. - Who?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,315,I...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,316,- Who? - I never saw.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,317,- Who? - I never saw.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,318,"Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to..."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,319,- Who? - I didn't see anyone help him.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,320,Take it off! Take it off!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,321,"- Who helped him? - Ganes, the butcher,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,322,- and his son. - That's better.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,323,"- You've been very helpful. - No, stop, please!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,324,"What are you doing? Please, stop!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,325,"Please, stop! No! No!"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,326,I told you everything! No!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,327,No!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,328,Joffrey.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,329,Cersei.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,330,Ilyn Payne. The Hound.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,331,"Please, Polliver. Some food."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,332,Just a crust of bread.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,333,Polliver.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,334,The Mountain.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,335,"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,336,"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,337,- Can that truly be you? - Who else might it be?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,338,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,339,- Whose banner is that? - My own.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,340,"I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,341,Why is your stag on fire?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,342,The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,343,"Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,344,"Mmm, brother,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,345,now I understand why you found religion in your old age.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,346,"Watch yourself, Renly."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,347,"No, no, I'm relieved."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,348,I never really believed you were a fanatic.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,349,"Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,350,but not a godly man.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,351,You should kneel before your brother.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,352,"He's the Lord's chosen,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,353,born amidst salt and smoke.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,354,Born amidst salt and smoke?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,355,- Is he a ham? - That's twice I've warned you.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,356,Listen to yourselves.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,357,"If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,358,and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,359,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,360,Your husband was a supporter of my claim.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,361,Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,362,And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,363,We share a common enemy.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,364,The Iron Throne is mine by right.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,365,All those that deny that are my foes.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,366,"The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,367,Old men deny it with their death rattle
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,368,and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,369,No one wants you for their king.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,370,"You never wanted any friends, brother."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,371,But a man without friends is a man without power.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,372,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,373,"Strike your banners, come to me before dawn,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,374,and I will grant you your old seat in the Council.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,375,I'll even name you my heir
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,376,until a son is born to me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,377,Otherwise I shall destroy you.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,378,"Look across those fields, brother."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,379,Can you see all those banners?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,380,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,381,No.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,382,The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,383,"We shall see, Renly."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,384,"Come the dawn, we shall see."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,385,"Look to your sins, Lord Renly."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,386,The night is dark and full of terrors.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,387,Would you believe I loved him once?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,388,I thought we were welcome.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,389,"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,390,"you might do the same, Khaleesi."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,391,Horde?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,392,My name is Daenerys...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,393,Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,394,"You know me, my lord?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,395,"Only by reputation, Khaleesi."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,396,"And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,397,They call you the Mother of Dragons.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,398,And what should I call you?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,399,"Oh, my name is quite long"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,400,and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,401,I am simply a trader of spices.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,402,"But we are the Thirteen,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,403,"charged with the governance and protection of Qarth,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,404,the greatest city that ever was or will be.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,405,- The beauty of Quarth is legendary... - Qarth.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,406,Qarth.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,407,Might we see the dragons?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,408,"My friend,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,409,we have travelled very far.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,410,"We have no food, no water."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,411,"Once I see my people fed, I would be honoured..."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,412,"Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,413,but no man alive has seen a living dragon.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,414,Some of my more sceptical friends
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,415,refuse to believe your children
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,416,even exist.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,417,All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,418,I am not a liar.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,419,"Oh, I don't think you are."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,420,"But as I've never met you before,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,421,my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,422,"Where I come from,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,423,"guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,424,Then perhaps you should return to where you come from.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,425,We wish you well.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,426,What are you doing?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,427,You promised to receive me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,428,We have received you.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,429,"Here we are, and here you are."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,430,"If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,431,Which we shall deeply regret.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,432,But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,433,by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,434,"Khaleesi, please be careful."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,435,Thirteen!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,436,"When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,437,and destroy those who have wronged me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,438,We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,439,Turn us away and we will burn you first.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,440,Ah.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,441,You are a true Targaryen.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,442,"Only, as you said a moment ago,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,443,"if we don't let you into the city, you will all die."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,444,And so...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,445,Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,446,that ever was or will be.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,447,"The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,448,The Thirteen have spoken.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,449,"I am one of the Thirteen,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,450,and I am still speaking.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,451,The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,452,and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,453,She is the Mother of Dragons.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,454,Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,455,I believe we can allow a few Dothraki
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,456,through our gates without dooming our city.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,457,"After all, here I am,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,458,"a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,459,Our decision is final.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,460,Very well.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,461,I invoke soumai.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,462,"I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,463,Be it on your head.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,464,"Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,465,You.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,466,Is there gold or silver in the village?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,467,- I'm not from the village. - Where is the Brotherhood?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,468,I don't know what that is.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,469,You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,470,What's this?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,471,"We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,472,Evidently not.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,473,Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,474,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,475,This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,476,"After we interrogate 'em, we usually just..."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,477,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,478,able young bodies and skilled labourers?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,479,"You, do you have a trade?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,480,"Smith, my lord."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,481,What are you looking at? Kneel!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,482,"Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,483,He'll do no such thing.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,484,"This one's a girl, you idiot,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,485,dressed as a boy.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,486,"- Why? - Safer to travel, my lord."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,487,Smart.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,488,More than I can say for this lot.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,489,Get these prisoners to work.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,490,Bring the girl.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,491,I need a new cupbearer.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,492,My lord.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,493,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,494,"Her Grace, the Queen Regent,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,495,commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,496,- Here's your warrant. - So it is.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,497,Will you take a cup with me?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,498,I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,499,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,500,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,501,I would have thought she'd come herself.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,502,Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,503,"I don't care what you make of it,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,504,so long as you release your prisoner immediately.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,505,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,506,As I said several times.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,507,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,508,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,509,"Cersei must have great trust in you,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,510,allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,511,The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,512,She often works from dusk till dawn.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,513,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,514,Ah.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,515,Lavender oil.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,516,"She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,517,I am a knight!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,518,"An anointed knight, yes."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,519,"Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,520,What? Nothing to say?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,521,"No more warnings for me, ser?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,522,You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,523,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,524,when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,525,It's not my fault!
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,526,Did she take you against your will?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,527,"Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,528,"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the king's squire,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,529,he told me to obey her in everything.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,530,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,531,I only meant I did as I was bid.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,532,"Hated every moment of it,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,533,is that what you'll have me believe?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,534,"A high place in court, a knighthood,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,535,my sister's legs spreading open for you at night.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,536,"Oh, yes, it must have been terrible."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,537,Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,538,"- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you. - Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,539,"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the queen."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,540,"I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,541,"- No, I think not. - My lord?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,542,You heard me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,543,My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,544,Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,545,Pleasure her whenever she requires.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,546,"No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,547,"I want to know what Cersei is doing,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,548,"where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,549,And you will tell me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,550,"Yes, my lord, I will."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,551,"I swear it, as you command."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,552,"Oh, rise, rise."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,553,Let us drink to our understanding.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,554,"Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,555,"Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,556,"Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,557,that I want no more conflict between us
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,558,"and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,559,But her demands?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,560,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,561,"- You will? - Yes, I'll release him in the morning."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,562,"Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,563,"I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,564,"but that would not, strictly speaking, be true."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,565,Stay within one table length.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,566,Your Grace.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,567,Do your knucklebones bring you luck?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,568,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,569,And it's four less fingernails to clean.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,570,- Fewer. - Pardon?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,571,Four fewer fingernails to clean.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,572,Never understood why you had to wear them.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,573,It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,574,It reminds me of your justice.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,575,It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,576,You were a hero and a smuggler.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,577,"A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,578,A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,579,- Does he listen? - To me?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,580,"Gods, no."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,581,But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,582,She has a name.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,583,I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,584,I've lived within the law for 17...
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,585,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,586,"Any shore, any night."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,587,What am I bringing ashore?
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,588,The red woman.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,589,No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,590,"I am true to Your Grace and always will be,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,591,"but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,592,Cleaner ways don't win wars.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,593,"Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,594,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,595,You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,596,"Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,597,"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,598,"If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,599,A man is good or he is evil.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,600,"- And which are you? - Oh, good."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,601,"I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,602,"Well, that must be very nice for you."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,603,- Do you love your wife? - I do.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,604,Yet you have known other women.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,605,Don't talk about my wife.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,606,I'm not. I'm talking about other women.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,607,"Like me, Ser Davos."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,608,You want me.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,609,You want to see what's beneath this robe.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,610,And you will.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,611,Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,612,"Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,613,"They are servants of light, the children of fire."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,614,"And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,615,These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,616,They can't bar our passage.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,617,Gods protect us.
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,618,"There's only one god, Ser Davos,"
S02E04,Garden Of Bones,619,and he only protects those who serve him.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,1,- You swear it? - By the mother.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,2,My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,3,Then I see no reason for hostility between us.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,4,Your son can go on calling himself King in the North.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,5,"The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,6,provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,7,And the wording of this oath?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,8,The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,9,"Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,10,And in return for my son's loyalty?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,11,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,12,"When that's done,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,13,"Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,14,as they have done many times before.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,15,"Our two houses have always been close,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,16,which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,17,Negotiate a peace with your brother.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,18,Negotiate with Stannis?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,19,You heard him out there.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,20,I'd have better luck debating the wind.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,21,Please bring my terms to your son.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,22,I believe we are natural allies.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,23,I hope he feels the same.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,24,Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,25,No!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,26,No.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,27,Follow me!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,28,"- You'll die for this. - No, wait, it wasn't her!"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,29,We've got to leave.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,30,They'll hang you for this.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,31,Now.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,32,I won't leave him.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,33,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,34,"Over there, go!"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,35,Not that way.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,36,We need to go home.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,37,"- Loras. - My lord, my lady."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,38,Get out.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,39,Stannis will be here in an hour.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,40,"When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,41,Your former companions will fight for the privilege
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,42,of selling you to their new king.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,43,And you want that privilege for yourself.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,44,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,45,not Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,46,There's no time for this.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,47,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,48,I'm not running from Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,49,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,50,I don't believe that.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,51,You don't believe that.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,52,Who gained the most from our king's death?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,53,Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,54,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,55,You can't stay here.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,56,"He would have been a true king,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,57,a good king.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,58,"Tell me, Ser Loras,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,59,what do you desire most in this world?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,60,Revenge.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,61,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,62,"but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,63,not today.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,64,You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,65,"If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,66,You can't avenge him from the grave.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,67,Bring the horses.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,68,Please.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,69,He was very handsome.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,70,"He was, Your Grace."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,71,"""Your Grace."""
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,72,Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,73,"And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,74,Do you want to be a queen?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,75,No.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,76,I want to be the queen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,77,Killed? By whom?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,78,Accounts differ.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,79,Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,80,Really? Who'd have thought?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,81,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,82,while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,83,after negotiations went sour.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,84,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,85,It's not what Varys says.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,86,"He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,87,which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,88,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,89,And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,90,"Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,91,"Aren't there other things you should be doing,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,92,like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,93,She'll be safer in Dorne.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,94,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,95,It so happens that I am.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,96,"Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,97,So clever.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,98,Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,99,Schemes and plots are the same thing.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,100,They are going to attack us.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,101,We need to be ready.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,102,No need to concern yourself over it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,103,The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,104,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,105,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,106,The answer will be the same.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,107,It's important that we talk about this.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,108,It's the king's royal prerogative
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,109,to withhold sensitive information from his councillors.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,110,It's wildfire.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,111,Wildfire?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,112,"You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,113,- No. - That's a lie right there.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,114,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,115,"Tell me,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,116,"if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,117,do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,118,"When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,119,I'm telling you the truth.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,120,The smart money would be on more likely.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,121,She's making wildfire.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,122,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,123,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,124,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,125,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,126,They are planning to launch it from the city walls
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,127,into Stannis' ships and armies.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,128,Please.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,129,When did she tell you this?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,130,I heard her talking with the pyromancer.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,131,"And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,132,I swear to you.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,133,Swear to me on what?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,134,On my life.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,135,But I don't care about your life.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,136,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,137,"I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,138,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,139,Just get out.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,140,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,141,to please kill you if anything should happen to me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,142,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,143,It will be my pleasure.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,144,Your Grace.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,145,What is it?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,146,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,147,I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,148,Fools love a fool.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,149,"I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,150,I need to speak to you
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,151,- about what I saw in that cave. - I thought I made it clear to you
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,152,there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,153,"Your Grace, I..."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,154,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,155,And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,156,You've come to lecture me on truth?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,157,I've come to tell you that what I saw...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,158,All my brother's bannermen have come to my side.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,159,"Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,160,They won't be able to resist us now.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,161,Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,162,"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron..."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,163,I'll hear no more about it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,164,"Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,165,When do we sail for King's Landing?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,166,As soon as I've consolidated my troops.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,167,We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,168,"Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,169,we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,170,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,171,That's not your concern.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,172,"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,173,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,174,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,175,"Oh, truth again."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,176,"All right, what's the truth?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,177,The hard truth?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,178,She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,179,Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,180,What do you believe?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,181,You won those bannermen from Renly.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,182,Don't lose them to her.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,183,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,184,And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,185,"Your Grace, I'm honoured, but my time on the sea"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,186,"was spent evading ships, not attacking them."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,187,The other lords won't be happy.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,188,Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,189,I don't hang them for treason.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,190,"Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,191,I've got it! I've got it!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,192,"So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,193,"Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,194,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,195,What do we have?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,196,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,197,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,198,Good thing. I'd be out of a job.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,199,What about your father?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,200,He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,201,He's very busy.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,202,Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,203,"We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,204,not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,205,- Corruption. - Yes!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,206,"We are swollen, bloated, foul."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,207,Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,208,and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,209,"Yes, a rotten king."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,210,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,211,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,212,The king is a lost cause.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,213,It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,214,"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,215,to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,216,You have to admire his imagination.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,217,He's talking about you.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,218,What? Demon monkey?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,219,People think you're pulling the king's strings.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,220,They blame you for the city's ills.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,221,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,222,You don't need to convince me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,223,Demon monkey.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,224,"Yeah, come on."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,225,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,226,I'm your commander. Welcome.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,227,Stop.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,228,Stop!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,229,Your captain commands you to stop!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,230,"Where are we headed, Captain?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,231,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,232,"There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,233,And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,234,I do.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,235,Your captain.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,236,"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,237,Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,238,Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,239,I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,240,All I need is a ship.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,241,"You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,242,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,243,"And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,244,Stop. We yield.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,245,Congratulations on your first command.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,246,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,247,"Oh, I'm not here for you."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,248,I was just on my way to Red Harbor.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,249,I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,250,Too narrow.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,251,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,252,That would never happen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,253,My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,254,"This lot, though..."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,255,Enjoy the Stony Shore.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,256,"Come on, I'll take you out."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,257,Who are you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,258,"Dagmer, your first mate."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,259,Why aren't you with the rest of them?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,260,Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,261,That would be good for a laugh.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,262,They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,263,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,264,You're not.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,265,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,266,They're all Iron Islanders.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,267,Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,268,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,269,"The seat of the House of Tallhart,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,270,a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,271,"- What, you don't think we could take it? - No, we could."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,272,We could never hold it for more than a few days.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,273,"As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,274,the Starks would send their men to take it back.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,275,And then...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,276,Take me to my ship.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,277,The Starks have overextended their lines.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,278,"Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,279,keeping their men and horses fed.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,280,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,281,The cold won't beat them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,282,Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,283,They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,284,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,285,they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,286,"This is war, no one's content."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,287,We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,288,"He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,289,"And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,290,You've been waiting for him to fail.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,291,"He is not going to fail, not without our help."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,292,So how do we stop him?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,293,"We've worked through the night, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,294,Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,295,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,296,"And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,297,"Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,298,My wife's in Lannisport.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,299,"Well, then you'd better start riding."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,300,"Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,301,"If your name wasn't Lannister,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,302,you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,303,"Not wine, water."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,304,We'll be here for some time.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,305,Girl.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,306,Where are you from?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,307,"Maidenpool, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,308,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,309,"House Mooton, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,310,And what is their sigil?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,311,A red salmon.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,312,I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,313,"You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,314,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,315,"Barrowton, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,316,House Dustin.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,317,Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,318,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,319,They call him the Young Wolf.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,320,And?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,321,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,322,They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,323,They say he can't be killed.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,324,And do you believe them?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,325,"No, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,326,Anyone can be killed.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,327,Fetch that water.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,328,A girl says nothing.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,329,A girl keeps her mouth closed.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,330,"No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,331,A boy becomes a girl.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,332,I was always a girl.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,333,And I was always aware.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,334,But the girl keeps secrets.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,335,It is not for a man to spoil them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,336,You're one of them now.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,337,I should have let you burn.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,338,And you fetch water for one of them now.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,339,Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,340,- I didn't have a choice. - You did.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,341,I did.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,342,And here we are.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,343,A man pays his debts.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,344,A man owes three.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,345,Three what?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,346,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,347,And only death may pay for life.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,348,You saved me and the two I was with.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,349,You stole three deaths from the Red God.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,350,We have to give them back.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,351,Speak three names
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,352,and the man will do the rest.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,353,"Three lives I will give you,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,354,"no more, no less,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,355,and we're done.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,356,I can name anyone
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,357,and you'll kill him?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,358,A man has said.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,359,The one who tortures everyone.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,360,A man needs a name.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,361,I don't know his name.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,362,They call him the Tickler.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,363,That is enough.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,364,"Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,365,He's not here yet.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,366,"He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,367,When will he come?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,368,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,369,My uncle told me stories about him.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,370,Most of them are true.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,371,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,372,The whole winter.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,373,He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,374,Had to wait for the thaw.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,375,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,376,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,377,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,378,Gilly would love it here.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,379,There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,380,About time you did something.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,381,At least you'll keep warm.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,382,The Fist of the First Men.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,383,Think of how old this place is.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,384,"Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,385,before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,386,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,387,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,388,all through the long night.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,389,"What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,390,Stupid.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,391,Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,392,I think they were afraid.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,393,I think they came here to get away from something.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,394,And I don't think it worked.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,395,Wildlings?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,396,One blast is for rangers returning.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,397,Wildlings is two blasts.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,398,"So you got to stand there waiting,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,399,wondering.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,400,"One blast for friends,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,401,two for foes.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,402,And three for White Walkers.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,403,"It's been a thousand years,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,404,but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,405,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,406,- Well... - I read it in a book.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,407,Look.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,408,It's Qhorin Halfhand.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,409,"Aye, we'll live another day."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,410,Hurrah.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,411,"Take care, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,412,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,413,"""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."""
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,414,"Oh, I have not conducted this experiment."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,415,It could well be true.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,416,"The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,417,"and, of course, flesh."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,418,"The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,419,"After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,420,My companion takes issue.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,421,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,422,making grand claims about jars full of pig shit.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,423,- No offence meant. - Our order does not deal in pig shit.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,424,The substance is fire given form.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,425,And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,426,To do what?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,427,The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,428,How much do you have?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,429,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,430,"then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,431,but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,432,"My lord, this man is insulting."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,433,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,434,but things can get a bit messy.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,435,"'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,436,"Men die, men shit themselves, men run,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,437,"which means pots falling,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,438,"which means fire inside the walls,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,439,which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,440,My friend remains unconvinced.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,441,He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,442,"Well, he's not living any more."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,443,"And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,444,"Men win wars, not magic tricks."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,445,"We have been working tirelessly, day and night,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,446,ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,447,"Our present count stands at 7,811."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,448,Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,449,This is a shit idea.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,450,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my adviser, Wisdom Hallyne."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,451,The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,452,You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,453,You'll be making it for me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,454,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,455,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,456,"Yes, Khaleesi."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,457,He loves you.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,458,I rewove this part of the top.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,459,And I fixed the heel on this one.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,460,"Thank you, my friend."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,461,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,462,They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,463,It is known.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,464,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,465,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,466,May he ride forever through the night lands.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,467,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,468,Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,469,You would look like a real princess in Xaro's...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,470,She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,471,"You should wear it, Khaleesi."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,472,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,473,And you must visit the night market.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,474,The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,475,It sounds wonderful.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,476,The Meereenis think they have a night market.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,477,I will take you there myself.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,478,Please excuse me for a moment.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,479,What are they doing?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,480,Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,481,Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,482,"They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,483,Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,484,Or melt it. Very simple.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,485,We are his guests!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,486,You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,487,"Of course not, Khaleesi!"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,488,We will wait until we leave.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,489,Not even when we leave.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,490,Why not?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,491,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,492,I will hear no more.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,493,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,494,was steal things better men have built.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,495,It's not the only thing.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,496,They're quite good at killing the better men.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,497,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,498,Mother of Dragons.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,499,"On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,500,A demonstration?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,501,Take this gem.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,502,Look at it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,503,Into its depths.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,504,So many facets.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,505,Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,506,Often more than once.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,507,"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,508,it would be an honour to host you at the House of the Undying.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,509,"You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,510,My apologies.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,511,Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,512,It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,513,Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,514,What is the House of the Undying?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,515,It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,516,and drink shade of the evening.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,517,It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,518,"So soft, they actually believe their parlour tricks are magic."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,519,You watch over her.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,520,Do I know you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,521,I know you.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,522,Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,523,Who are you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,524,I'm no one.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,525,But she is the Mother of Dragons.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,526,"She needs true protectors, now more than ever."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,527,They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,528,"And when they see, they shall lust,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,529,for dragons are fire made flesh.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,530,And fire is power.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,531,It looked like Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,532,To me it just looked like...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,533,A shadow in the shape of a man.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,534,In the shape of Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,535,We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,536,"Will you stay there long, my lady?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,537,Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,538,"After that, I will leave for Winterfell."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,539,My two youngest need me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,540,I've been away from them for far too long.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,541,I never knew my mother.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,542,I'm sorry.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,543,My own mother died on the birthing bed
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,544,when I was very young.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,545,It's a bloody business.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,546,What comes after is even harder.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,547,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,548,"will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,549,You mean to kill Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,550,I swore a vow.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,551,But Stannis has a great army around him.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,552,His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,553,I'm as good as any of them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,554,I should never have fled.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,555,Renly's death was no fault of yours.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,556,You served him bravely.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,557,I only held him that once
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,558,as he was dying.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,559,"He's gone, Brienne."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,560,You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,561,Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,562,"I do not know your son, my lady."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,563,"But I could serve you, if you would have me."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,564,You have courage.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,565,"Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,566,a woman's kind of courage.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,567,"And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,568,Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,569,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,570,"Then I am yours, my lady."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,571,"I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,572,I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,573,I vow that you shall always have a place in my home
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,574,and at my table
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,575,and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonour.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,576,I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,577,"And it's not just thieves, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,578,"There's wolves in them hills now,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,579,more than I ever seen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,580,They come down in the night and they kill my sheep.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,581,"My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,582,"They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,583,I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,584,I can't keep watch all day and all night.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,585,We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,586,to help watch over your flock
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,587,if you can give them room and board.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,588,My wife always prayed for more children.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,589,"We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,590,And may the gods bless you and yours.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,591,Stop it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,592,"If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,593,- Good. - Hodor.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,594,- Hodor. - Ah! Lord Stark.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,595,Torrhen's Square is under siege.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,596,Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,597,How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,598,Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,599,Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,600,We have to help them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,601,"Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,602,Do you need so many?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,603,"If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,604,"Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,605,"Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,606,"So, what does it mean?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,607,Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,608,I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,609,"Must not mean anything, then."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,610,You're lying.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,611,"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,612,- You know what it means. - I never said I didn't.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,613,You didn't give me an honest answer.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,614,That's not the same as being a liar.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,615,"Well, it's not far off."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,616,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,617,"In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,618,Now who's a liar?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,619,What did you see in your dream?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,620,Something bad?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,621,"Tell me, boy."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,622,I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,623,I saw waves crashing against the gates
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,624,and the water came flowing over the walls...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,625,It flooded the castle.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,626,"Drowned men were floating here,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,627,in the yard.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,628,Ser Rodrik was one of them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,629,The sea is hundreds of miles away.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,630,I know.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,631,- It's just a stupid dream. - I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,632,Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,633,Osha.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,634,"The three-eyed raven,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,635,what do they say about it north of the Wall?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,636,They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,637,- There. - Where?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,638,On that mountain.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,639,I don't see very well.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,640,A fire.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,641,There's a fire.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,642,The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,643,"When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,644,Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honour.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,645,How many wildlings have joined him?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,646,"From what we can tell, all of them."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,647,Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,648,They're almost ready to make their move.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,649,- Where? - Somewhere safe.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,650,Somewhere south.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,651,Can't just march into their midst.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,652,And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,653,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,654,Mance was one of us once.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,655,Now he's one of them.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,656,He's going to teach them our way of doing things.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,657,They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,658,"They're gonna be more organised than before, more disciplined,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,659,more like us.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,660,"So we need to be more like them, do things their way."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,661,"Sneak in, kill Mance,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,662,and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,663,- And to do that... - We need to get rid of those lookouts.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,664,It's not a job for 400 men.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,665,I need to move fast and silent.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,666,"Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,667,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,668,"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,669,"You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,670,I've fought and killed a wight.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,671,How many rangers can say that?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,672,He's the one?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,673,Aye. You killed a wight.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,674,You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,675,Craster?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,676,"In the boy's defence, that's a tough old goat."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,677,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,678,It would be no trouble.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,679,"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,680,Go on.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,681,"So, tell me,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,682,how long has your manservant been in love with you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,683,He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,684,"He's my adviser,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,685,my friend.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,686,Unlikely.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,687,I can almost always tell what a man wants.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,688,And what about what a woman wants?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,689,Much more complicated.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,690,"You, for example, what do you want?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,691,To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,692,Why?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,693,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,694,and find them a safe home.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,695,You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,696,I want them because they're mine by right.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,697,The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,698,"Ah, a conqueror."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,699,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,700,"No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,701,except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,702,So you wanted more than you had and you took it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,703,"You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,704,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,705,"At the gates of the city, you bled for me."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,706,Why?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,707,I will show you why.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,708,The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,709,The hardest steel does not make a mark.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,710,I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,711,I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,712,They all went home empty-handed.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,713,The only thing that can open this door
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,714,is this key.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,715,And behind the door?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,716,And it can all be mine?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,717,All? Let us say half.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,718,"More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies..."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,719,Enough to go home.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,720,All I have to do?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,721,Is marry me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,722,That was a romantic proposal.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,723,"I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,724,I come from nothing.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,725,My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,726,"But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,727,and our children will be princes and princesses.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,728,See?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,729,I have more ambition than you thought.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,730,"The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,731,Robert Baratheon is dead.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,732,If you cross the sea with an army you bought...
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,733,The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,734,Four false kings destroying the country.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,735,"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,736,The usurper is dead.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,737,"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,738,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,739,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,740,or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,741,Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,742,They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,743,"Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,744,"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,745,we'd all be dead by now.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,746,"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have,"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,747,- but you must... - Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,748,- I only want... - What do you want?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,749,Tell me.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,750,- To see you on the Iron Throne. - Why?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,751,You have a good claim.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,752,A title. A birthright.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,753,But you have something more than that.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,754,"You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,755,"You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,756,Someone who can rule and should rule.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,757,Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,758,There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,759,"So what would you have me do, as my adviser?"
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,760,Make your own way.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,761,Find your own ship. You only need one.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,762,"The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,763,And how do I get the ship?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,764,I'll find it for you.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,765,A sound ship with a good captain.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,766,I look forward to meeting him.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,767,Khaleesi.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,768,You should stand sideface.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,769,Sideface?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,770,Sideways.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,771,Why?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,772,Smaller target.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,773,Am I fighting someone?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,774,You're practising for a fight.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,775,You should practise right.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,776,Guards!
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,777,Did you see anything?
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,778,Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,779,Go up the battlement.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,780,Move away.
S02E05,The Ghost Of Harrenhal,781,Stand back. He's dead.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,1,I've taken your castle.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,2,- Theon? - It's Prince Theon now.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,3,Get up. You have to get dressed.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,4,I've taken Winterfell.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,5,I took it. I'm occupying it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,6,I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,7,- Why? - To take the castle.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,8,- You went with Robb. - And he sent me back to Pyke.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,9,I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,10,- Where's Hodor? - I don't know.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,11,Find the halfwit.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,12,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,13,- Why? - So you and I can go down and tell them
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,14,- how you've yielded Winterfell to me. - I won't.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,15,"Yes, you will."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,16,I won't. I'll never yield.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,17,We'll fight you and throw you out.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,18,The castle is mine.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,19,But these people are still yours.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,20,"You'll yield to keep them safe,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,21,to keep them alive.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,22,That's what a good lord would do.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,23,Think carefully about what you want to say.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,24,Theon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,25,Did you hate us the whole time?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,26,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,27,Louder.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,28,Say Prince Theon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,29,I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,30,You all know me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,31,"Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,32,"Farlen, you be silent."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,33,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,34,He has more sense than you do.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,35,All of you should do as he commands.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,36,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,37,and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,38,He claims the North as well by right of conquest.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,39,- You are all his subjects. - Bugger that.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,40,I serve the Starks.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,41,- If you think you can hold the North with it... - Shut up!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,42,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,43,- I will be as good to you as he ever was. - Steady.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,44,"Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,45,"Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,46,informing my father of my victory here.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,47,And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,48,Inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,49,"You are a maester of the Citadel,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,50,"sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,51,I am.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,52,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,53,Send the ravens.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,54,My lord.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,55,My Lord Greyjoy.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,56,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,57,What do you want?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,58,I was brought here a captive.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,59,You were here the day I was taken.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,60,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,61,Let me serve you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,62,Serve me how?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,63,"I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,64,It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,65,Put a spear in my hand again.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,66,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,67,Get up.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,68,Step aside.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,69,Why?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,70,"It's your dream, little lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,71,The ocean has come to swallow this place.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,72,I ain't letting it drown me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,73,You'll all go about your tasks as usual.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,74,- And in a few days' time... - Greyjoy!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,75,We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,76,Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,77,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,78,It grieves me you've less honour than a back alley whore.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,79,You were raised here under this roof.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,80,- These people are your people. - They are not my people.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,81,King Robb thought of you as a brother.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,82,My brothers are dead.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,83,"They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,84,"Aye, they died fighting a war your father started."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,85,Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,86,"Among them, but not one of them."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,87,"I was his hostage, taken from my home."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,88,If he were alive to see this...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,89,He's not. He's dead.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,90,The Seven Kingdoms are at war.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,91,And Winterfell is mine.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,92,I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,93,"You've served this house faithfully, old man."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,94,But keep talking and I'll...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,95,Take him to the cells. Lock him up...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,96,My prince.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,97,You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,98,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,99,"No, he has to pay the iron price."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,100,They'll never respect you while he lives.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,101,"Ser Rodrik,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,102,I sentence you to death!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,103,No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,104,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,105,I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,106,He disrespected me in front of my men.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,107,"That was his decision, not mine."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,108,He is worth more to you alive than dead.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,109,The Starks will pay.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,110,"Please, Theon, think what you do."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,111,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,112,Come.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,113,No!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,114,- No! - Theon!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,115,Rodrik!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,116,He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,117,- I'm begging you. - Coward.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,118,Stop.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,119,Stop! Stop right now!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,120,"You don't give commands any more, little lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,121,"- Please, stop this. Please stop him. - Hush now, child."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,122,I'm off to see your father.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,123,You said no harm would come!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,124,"You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,125,"Any last words, old man?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,126,"Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,127,Now you are truly lost.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,128,"Theon, please don't. Do something!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,129,"I'll do anything, please!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,130,"No, please stop it!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,131,"Ghost, stay with us."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,132,Ghost!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,133,There goes your pet.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,134,He's not a pet.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,135,"No, you're right, he's not."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,136,You can't tame a wild thing.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,137,You can't trust a wild thing.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,138,- Ghost is different. - So you think.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,139,"Wild creatures have their own rules,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,140,their own reasons.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,141,And you'll never know them.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,142,Now the wildlings we're looking for
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,143,sleep during the day and hunt at night.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,144,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,145,I said you can't.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,146,They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,147,and do their killing when it's dark.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,148,We could do the same.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,149,"No, we couldn't."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,150,This is their country.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,151,"They know where to walk, where not to walk."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,152,I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,153,My father always said I'm of the North.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,154,"- I wasn't joking. - Look around, boy."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,155,This look like home to you?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,156,"You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,157,You understand me?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,158,"No, you don't."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,159,We're at war.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,160,We've always been at war.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,161,It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,162,"We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,163,The Watch has given you a great gift.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,164,"You only have one thing to give in return,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,165,your life.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,166,- I'll gladly give my life. - I don't want you to be glad about it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,167,I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,168,"And know this, boy."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,169,Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,170,They'll never know what you've done.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,171,They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,172,But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,173,north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,174,"Now, do you understand me?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,175,I do.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,176,You're even dumber than you look.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,177,"It's just words, boy,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,178,to keep us a little warmer in the night.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,179,Make us feel like we've got a purpose.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,180,Come on.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,181,We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,182,- Can you read? - My lord?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,183,Can you read?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,184,This letter detailing our infantry movements
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,185,was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,186,It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,187,"My apologies, my lord. I must have..."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,188,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,189,It's the one on this...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,190,My cupbearer can read better than you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,191,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,192,"My lord, I..."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,193,To the Starks of Winterfell!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,194,"Who have 20,000 men and my son!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,195,I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,196,I see I overestimated you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,197,"If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll..."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,198,Leave us.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,199,"Put the book away, girl."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,200,Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,201,Lord Petyr Baelish.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,202,Mmm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,203,Give us the room.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,204,Clear all this.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,205,- Lord Tywin. - Baelish.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,206,- Wine? - Thank you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,207,What news from the capital?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,208,I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,209,"Ah, the late King Renly."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,210,Rather a short reign.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,211,"Murdered by a woman, I hear."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,212,So they say.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,213,There has been talk of other forces at work.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,214,Dark forces.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,215,Here.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,216,Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,217,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,218,You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,219,"Yes, a crisis is an opportunity."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,220,What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,221,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,222,"Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,223,"- feeding horses and soldiers. - Yes, yes, yes."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,224,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,225,Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,226,And Margaery...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,227,Wants to be queen.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,228,"Yes, she does."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,229,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,230,- Against my grandson. - They did.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,231,And perhaps that treason should be punished
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,232,"one day,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,233,after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,234,More wine for Lord Baelish.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,235,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,236,I believe that an advantageous agreement...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,237,The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,238,They have.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,239,"Pardon, my lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,240,It's only wine.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,241,You would ride there yourself?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,242,"Tonight, with your leave."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,243,I'll have an answer by nightfall.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,244,"That'll be all, girl."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,245,And what else?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,246,"On your son Tyrion's directive,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,247,I met with Catelyn Stark.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,248,Why?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,249,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,250,Hmm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,251,- A girl. - A wildling.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,252,We could question her.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,253,You could.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,254,She won't answer.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,255,I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,256,- What's your name? - Ygritte.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,257,She was reaching for this axe when you got to her.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,258,"Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,259,I gave you my name.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,260,I'm Jon Snow.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,261,You ought to burn them you killed.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,262,We'd need a big fire for that.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,263,"Tell me, Ygritte."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,264,Why do you want us to build a big fire?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,265,Are there some more friends in the area?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,266,Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,267,Our boy here's already killed one dead man.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,268,He can do it again if he has to.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,269,What waits beyond the pass?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,270,- The free folk. - How many?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,271,Hundreds and thousands.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,272,"More than you've ever seen, crow."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,273,Why come to the mountains?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,274,What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,275,Do you mean to march on the Wall?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,276,"Do you know who I am, girl?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,277,Qhorin Halfhand.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,278,Tell me true.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,279,"If your people captured me,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,280,would they take me prisoner?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,281,They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,282,"If not, they'd kill you slow."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,283,We have no food for her.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,284,Can't spare a man to watch her.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,285,Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,286,- It needs to be done. Want me to do it? - No.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,287,"No, I'll do it."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,288,"Come, brothers."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,289,We'll leave him to it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,290,We'll meet you at the top.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,291,Don't take too long.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,292,We're deep in their country now.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,293,"You never killed a woman before, did you?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,294,You don't need to do it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,295,Mance would take you. I know he would.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,296,There's secret ways.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,297,The crows would never catch us.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,298,I'm as much a crow as they are.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,299,Will you burn me?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,300,After?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,301,Can't.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,302,Someone might see the smoke.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,303,"Strike hard and true,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,304,"Jon Snow,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,305,or I'll come back and haunt you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,306,That's cold.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,307,Go on.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,308,Be quick about it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,309,Do it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,310,"Bastard, do it!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,311,You can't do it. We both know it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,312,"The sun's going down, Jon Snow."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,313,And your friends are nowhere close.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,314,I'll find them.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,315,Call for them. Go on.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,316,Call loudly.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,317,May the Seven guide the princess on her journey.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,318,May the Mother give her health.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,319,May the crone give her wisdom.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,320,May the warrior give her courage.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,321,One day I pray you love someone.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,322,"I pray you love her so much,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,323,"when you close your eyes, you see her face."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,324,I want that for you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,325,"I want you to know what it's like to love someone,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,326,to truly love someone.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,327,Before I take her from you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,328,You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,329,Princes don't cry.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,330,"- I saw you cry. - Did you say something, my lady?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,331,My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,332,So?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,333,It seems a normal thing.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,334,Is your little brother a prince?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,335,No.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,336,"Not really relevant then, is it?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,337,"Come, dog."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,338,Hail Joffrey!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,339,Hail to the King.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,340,"Seven blessings on you, Your Grace."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,341,Murderer! Bastard!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,342,All hail the king.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,343,He's no king. He's a bastard!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,344,"Please, Your Grace, we're hungry."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,345,Freak.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,346,Get the prince back to the Keep now.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,347,"Yes, my lord. Come, quickly."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,348,"Please, Your Grace, give us some food!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,349,"Bread, Your Grace, please!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,350,Who threw that?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,351,I want the man who threw that.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,352,Find who did that and bring him to me!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,353,- Hold on! - Hold them back!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,354,Just kill them! Kill them all!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,355,- Move. Move! - Pull back!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,356,Tear him to pieces!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,357,What are you doing? I want these people executed!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,358,And they want the same for you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,359,Where's Sansa?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,360,- Through the door. - Come on.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,361,Push hard.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,362,Protect the king!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,363,- Get back! - Fall back!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,364,Keep him safe!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,365,Brotherfucker!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,366,- Watch out. - Hold them back.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,367,Hey.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,368,Traitors!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,369,"- I'll have all their heads. - You blind, bloody fool."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,370,You can't insult me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,371,"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,372,but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,373,"- You can't... - I can, I am."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,374,They attacked me!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,375,"They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,376,"They're starving, you fool."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,377,All because of a war you started.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,378,You're talking to a king!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,379,And now I've struck a king.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,380,Did my hand fall from my wrist?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,381,Where is the Stark girl?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,382,Let them have her.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,383,"If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,384,"You owe him quite a bit, you know."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,385,Where are you going?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,386,"You ever been fucked, little girl?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,387,Come here.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,388,Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,389,I take my orders from the king.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,390,- Where? - This way.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,391,Please!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,392,No! No!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,393,Please!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,394,"You're all right now, little bird. You're all right."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,395,We'll get you. We'll get you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,396,This way.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,397,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,398,The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,399,"- See to that cut. - Well done, Clegane."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,400,I didn't do it for you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,401,He shouldn't make me wait.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,402,The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,403,He makes everyone wait.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,404,"Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,405,if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,406,I already have a husband.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,407,"Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,408,You are far too young to be a widow forever
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,409,and far too beautiful.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,410,And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,411,I have travelled very far in my life
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,412,"and met many women,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,413,but none that are immune to flattery.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,414,The Mother of Dragons!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,415,Here he comes.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,416,Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,417,Terrible dreams.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,418,I could not sleep until the sun was shining
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,419,and the birds were singing.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,420,Look what a beauty you are
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,421,now the Red Waste has been washed off you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,422,I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,423,The silver hair of a true Targaryen.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,424,"Xaro Xhoan Daxos,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,425,she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,426,"Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,427,"who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,428,married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,429,Every lady alive was lovelier
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,430,and higher born than my grandfather.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,431,"Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,432,I'll have them flogged in the square.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,433,"Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,434,but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,435,"Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,436,"So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,437,My birthright.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,438,The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,439,I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,440,I cannot give you what I do not have.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,441,I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,442,I'm asking you for ships.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,443,I need to cross the Narrow Sea.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,444,I need my ships as well.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,445,"I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,446,Whatever you grant me now will be repaid
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,447,three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,448,Retake?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,449,Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,450,"My father sat there, before he was murdered."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,451,"But if you did not sit on it yourself,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,452,"would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,453,I didn't come here to argue grammar.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,454,Of course not. You came to take my ships.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,455,"So let me explain my position, little princess."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,456,"Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,457,I make my living by trade.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,458,And I judge every trade on its merits.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,459,You ask for ships.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,460,You say I shall be repaid triple.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,461,I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,462,"But before you repay your debts,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,463,you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,464,- Do you have an army? - Not yet.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,465,You do not have an army.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,466,Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,467,There are many there that support my claim.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,468,When were you there last?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,469,I left when I was a baby.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,470,"So, in truth, you have no allies."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,471,The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,472,Ah.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,473,"Forgive me, little princess,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,474,but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,475,Now if you'll pardon me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,476,"Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,477,"Yes, we've met. A shrewd man."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,478,"For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,479,He believed... The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,480,How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,481,But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,482,"into a great fire, they would hatch."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,483,"When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,484,"But when the fire burned out,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,485,"I was unhurt,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,486,the Mother of Dragons.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,487,Do you understand?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,488,I'm no ordinary woman.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,489,My dreams come true.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,490,I admire your passion.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,491,"But in business, I trust in logic, not passion."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,492,"I'm sorry, little princess."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,493,I am not your little princess.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,494,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,495,and I will take what is mine.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,496,"With fire and blood, I will take it."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,497,"Yes, my lady, but not with my ships."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,498,Who taught you to read?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,499,"My father, my lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,500,Hmm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,501,I taught my son Jaime to read.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,502,"The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,503,He couldn't make sense of the letters.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,504,He reversed them in his head.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,505,The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,506,and that we simply must accept it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,507,Ha!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,508,"After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,509,"He hated me for it, for a time."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,510,For a long time.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,511,But he learned.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,512,Hmm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,513,Where is your father? Is he alive?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,514,Who was he?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,515,A stonemason.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,516,A stonemason who could read?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,517,Hmm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,518,He taught himself.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,519,Quite a man.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,520,What killed him?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,521,Loyalty.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,522,"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,523,Did...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,524,"Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,525,No.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,526,But you've already begun.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,527,"Did you know your father, my lord?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,528,I did.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,529,I grew up with him.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,530,I watched him grow old.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,531,He loved us.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,532,"He was a good man,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,533,but a weak man.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,534,A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,535,I'm cold.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,536,"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,537,Mmm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,538,"Where are you going, girl?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,539,"The armoury, my lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,540,- Why? - Lord Tywin sent me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,541,What might this be?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,542,Lord Tywin gave it to me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,543,What for?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,544,To take to the armoury.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,545,Why would he do that?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,546,Let's go and ask him.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,547,Move!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,548,Get out of the way!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,549,Amory Lorch.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,550,A girl has named a second name.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,551,A man will do what must be done.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,552,Now!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,553,A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,554,A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,555,But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,556,It has to be now.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,557,Guard!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,558,- Your Grace. - Your Grace.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,559,"My honour, Your Grace."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,560,Your Grace.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,561,- Your Grace. - Quent.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,562,Lady Talisa.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,563,Your Grace.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,564,I'm not sure I'm a lady.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,565,Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,566,It's hard to keep all the rules straight.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,567,"But if I remember my lessons,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,568,a woman of noble birth is always called a lady.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,569,Unless she's a queen or a princess.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,570,I could find someone who knows.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,571,Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,572,Because it's obvious.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,573,"What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,574,"and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,575,I'd call you a liar.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,576,Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,577,I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,578,"Better at amputations, I'm afraid."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,579,Quite a pretty spot.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,580,Will we be here long?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,581,I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,582,I'm not a spy.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,583,"Of course, a spy would deny being a spy."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,584,You're right. You've found me out.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,585,"I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. ""The young wolf is on the move."""
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,586,Perhaps you'd join me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,587,"If you've got time, of course, for, well..."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,588,Robb.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,589,Mother.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,590,"Mother, this is Lady Talisa."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,591,She's been helping with the wounded.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,592,She's been very helpful.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,593,- Lady Talisa. - Lady Stark.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,594,Lady Talisa...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,595,- Maegyr. - Maegyr?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,596,"Forgive me, I do not know this name."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,597,An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,598,"Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,599,I've missed you.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,600,"Yes, you look positively forlorn."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,601,"You surprised me, that's all."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,602,I didn't think I'd see you today.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,603,I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,604,I know.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,605,You have inherited your father's responsibilities.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,606,I'm afraid they come at a cost.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,607,- You are promised to another. - I know.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,608,A debt that must be paid.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,609,- I haven't forgotten. - Your Grace. My lady.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,610,News from Winterfell.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,611,Your brothers desert you?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,612,I can tell you which way to go.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,613,We'll stop here.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,614,Too dark to go any farther today.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,615,Here? There's no shelter here.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,616,There's no shelter anywhere.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,617,There is... if you know where to look.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,618,The cold could kill us both.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,619,- If you light a fire... - No fire.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,620,- But a fire is... - No fire.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,621,Have it your way.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,622,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,623,Bet you freeze to death before I do.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,624,Bet your life.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,625,Think they're out looking for you?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,626,- Yes. - Think they'll find you?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,627,Yes.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,628,You're brave.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,629,"Stupid,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,630,but brave.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,631,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,632,Stop moving.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,633,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,634,Stop it!
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,635,- You're still moving. - Was I?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,636,I didn't notice that time.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,637,This cannot be true.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,638,"We've had ravens from White Harbour,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,639,Barrowton and the Dreadfort.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,640,I'm afraid it is true.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,641,Why? Why would Theon...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,642,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,643,- My brothers? - We've heard nothing of them.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,644,But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,645,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,646,I must go north at once.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,647,"There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,648,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,649,- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't... - You are a king.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,650,And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,651,Let me go and talk to Theon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,652,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,653,Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,654,Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,655,He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,656,We have the Lannisters on the run.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,657,"If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,658,My boy would be honoured to bring you Prince Theon's head.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,659,Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,660,"And Theon, I want him brought to me alive."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,661,I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,662,And then I'll take his head myself.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,663,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,664,I'm no liar.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,665,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,666,I done what I had to do to stay alive.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,667,I hate the Starks as well as you do.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,668,"Let me serve you, my lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,669,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,670,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,671,"- I'm a prince now, and you'd do well... - There are other ways to serve, my prince."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,672,Like what?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,673,"We know things, the free people."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,674,You know things?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,675,Like what?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,676,How to eat dirt?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,677,Other things.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,678,Savage things.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,679,Wait outside.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,680,I always wondered what you had under there.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,681,It comes at a price.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,682,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,683,I already had that.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,684,"What do you want then,"
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,685,other than your miserable life?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,686,What all free people want.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,687,My freedom.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,688,"Well, you shall have it, then."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,689,But only if you serve me well.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,690,- Ow! - Shh.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,691,- It's not deep. - I thought they were going to kill me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,692,"They thought so, too."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,693,"He hated me, the man who hit me."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,694,I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,695,"He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,696,- Of course he did. - Why? Why would a stranger...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,697,You are everything he will never have.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,698,Your horse eats better than his children.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,699,It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,700,I would have given them bread if I had it.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,701,I hate the king more than any of them.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,702,Don't say these things.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,703,If the wrong people hear you...
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,704,But you're not the wrong people.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,705,Don't trust anybody.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,706,Life is safer that way.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,707,And where are you going?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,708,I have something for you from Prince Theon.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,709,- What? - Me.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,710,He says I'm to make the rounds.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,711,And keep you warm.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,712,The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,713,The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,714,Why offend his best customer?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,715,And the Copper King offers me a single ship
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,716,on the condition that I lie with him for a night.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,717,Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,718,"When I came to this city, I had nothing."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,719,Truly nothing.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,720,I slept by the docks.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,721,"And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,722,"If not, I dreamed of food."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,723,"Today, I am the richest man in Qarth."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,724,Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honourable?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,725,"I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,726,"And here I am, with no regrets."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,727,Bar the gates. Ring the bells.
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,728,"Slowly, Khaleesi."
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,729,Where are they?
S02E06,The Old Gods And The New,730,Where are my dragons?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,1,A cripple?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,2,You let a cripple escape?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,3,"The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,4,The giant must have took him.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,5,The giant?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,6,Hodor?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,7,"Oh, that's all right, then."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,8,You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,9,"And Rickon, too? The little one?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,10,"Gone, along with the wildling woman."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,11,The one you were fucking.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,12,Right.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,13,Get the horses and the hounds.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,14,"Come on, find the scent."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,15,Where they going?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,16,Halt!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,17,Enjoying your first hunt?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,18,"So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,19,"With hunting, there's blood at the end."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,20,They're little boys.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,21,I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,22,So I kept my word. I never ran away.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,23,"If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,24,"Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,25,Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,26,They have no value to me missing.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,27,Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,28,Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,29,She'll get here long before they do.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,30,"And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell against 10,000."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,31,We have a scent!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,32,The hounds have the scent.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,33,"Come, Maester, don't look so grim."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,34,It's all just a game.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,35,We should have took more food.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,36,We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,37,Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,38,"And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,39,- The boy can't survive on walnuts. - I'm fine.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,40,We've been walking since before sunrise.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,41,- Even Hodor will tire. - Hodor.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,42,"- Even you, sweet giant. -  Hodor."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,43,"Wait, I know that farm."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,44,I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,45,Jack and Billy.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,46,- They'll give us some food. - We can't risk it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,47,"If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,48,Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,49,"You've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,50,They'll be after us with hounds.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,51,"We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,52,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,53,What's the matter?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,54,Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,55,Let's move.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,56,It is the first time.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,57,"How old are you, boy?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,58,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,59,You're a boy who's never been with a girl.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,60,Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,61,Don't call them that.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,62,"What, stones?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,63,Or bone?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,64,Neither.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,65,Both.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,66,Move!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,67,I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,68,"Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,69,As if I'd feel sorry for them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,70,Are there no girl crows?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,71,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,72,So the lads just do it with each other?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,73,No.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,74,- Never? - Never.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,75,We swore an oath.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,76,You have sheep at the Wall?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,77,"With your hands, then?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,78,No wonder you're all so miserable.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,79,- Would you please shut up? - Would you please shut up?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,80,"You think you're better than me, crow."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,81,- I'm a free woman. - You're a free woman?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,82,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,83,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,84,And you think you're free?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,85,You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,86,It was my choice to say the words.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,87,- So you don't like girls? - Of course I like girls.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,88,But you chose never to touch them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,89,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,90,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,91,Invade your lands?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,92,Wildlings raid our lands all the time.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,93,"Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,94,They're not your lands!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,95,We've been here the whole time.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,96,You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,97,My father was Ned Stark.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,98,I have the blood of the First Men.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,99,"My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,100,So why are you fighting us?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,101,Go on.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,102,Now I want you to tell me what happened.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,103,"Come on, this way."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,104,"Come on, speak up. Speak up."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,105,Wolfsbane.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,106,A rare substance.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,107,This is no common assassin.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,108,We hanged 20 men last night.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,109,I don't care if you hanged 100.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,110,A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,111,We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,112,Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,113,We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,114,We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,115,"I want them dead, every one."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,116,Killing them isn't the problem.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,117,It's finding them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,118,"Have you gone soft, Clegane?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,119,I always thought you had a talent for violence.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,120,"Burn the villages, burn the farms."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,121,Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,122,Mmm.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,123,Is that mutton?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,124,"Yes, my lord."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,125,Don't like mutton.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,126,- I'll bring something else. - Leave it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,127,- Are you hungry? - No.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,128,Of course you are.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,129,Eat.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,130,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,131,It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,132,Sit.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,133,Eat.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,134,You're small for your age.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,135,I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,136,I eat a lot.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,137,I just don't grow.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,138,Mmm.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,139,This will be my last war.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,140,Win or lose.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,141,Have you ever lost before?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,142,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,143,But this is the one I'll be remembered for.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,144,"The War of Five Kings, they're calling it."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,145,My legacy will be determined in the coming months.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,146,Do you know what legacy means?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,147,It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,148,It's what remains of you when you're gone.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,149,Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,150,The greatest fortress ever built.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,151,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,152,The Great Hall had 35 hearths.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,153,Thirty-five. Can you imagine?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,154,Look at it now.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,155,A blasted ruin.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,156,Do you know what happened?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,157,Dragons?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,158,Yes.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,159,Dragons happened.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,160,Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,161,"A million men could have marched on these walls,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,162,and a million men would have been repelled.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,163,But an attack from the air with dragon fire... Mmm-mmm.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,164,Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,165,Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,166,That's why every child alive still knows his name
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,167,300 years after his death.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,168,Aegon and his sisters.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,169,Mmm?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,170,It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,171,"It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,172,Correct.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,173,"A student of history, are you?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,174,Rhaenys rode Meraxes.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,175,Visenya rode Vhagar.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,176,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,177,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,178,She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,179,Hmm.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,180,"She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,181,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,182,Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,183,Most girls are idiots.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,184,You remind me of my daughter.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,185,Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,186,From my father.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,187,He was a well-read stonemason.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,188,Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,189,"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,190,"Careful now, girl."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,191,"I enjoy you, but be careful."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,192,Take that back to the kitchen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,193,Eat what you want.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,194,"And, girl."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,195,"""M'lord."""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,196,"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,197,"not ""my lord."""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,198,"If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,199,"My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,200,She taught me how to speak proper... Properly.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,201,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,202,Yes.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,203,Go on.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,204,"I beg pardon, ser."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,205,I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,206,- You were so brave. - Brave?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,207,A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,208,Does it give you joy to scare people?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,209,"No, it gives me joy to kill people."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,210,Spare me. You can't tell me
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,211,Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,212,It was his duty. He never liked it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,213,Is that what he told you?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,214,He lied.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,215,Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,216,Why are you always so hateful?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,217,You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,218,and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,219,I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,220,You are one of the Thirteen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,221,"If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,222,- They mean nothing to me on their own. - Nothing?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,223,They're more valuable than anything in the world.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,224,Shall we look inside my vault
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,225,and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,226,We will get them back.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,227,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,228,I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,229,A man is what others say he is and no more.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,230,"If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,231,I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,232,But it did happen under your roof.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,233,"Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,234,I don't care where you've been.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,235,You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,236,"We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,237,We're free.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,238,"If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,239,we'd shove a spear up his arse.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,240,We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,241,No.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,242,"No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,243,We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,244,"He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,245,"You could be free, too."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,246,You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,247,Wake up when you want to wake up.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,248,"I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,249,Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,250,You're a pretty lad.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,251,The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,252,Walk.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,253,I could teach you how to do it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,254,I know how to do it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,255,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,256,And what did she say?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,257,"She admired your spirit, Your Grace."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,258,And what then?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,259,She...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,260,"If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,261,we'd all hang.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,262,"She tore the paper in half, Your Grace."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,263,You've acted with honour.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,264,I thank you for it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,265,"Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,266,"Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,267,The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,268,Too many prisoners.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,269,Is there room for Ser Alton?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,270,Does he need to lie down?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,271,Have the men build him a new pen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,272,Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,273,Have your boy watch over them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,274,Torrhen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,275,That will be all.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,276,Your Grace.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,277,A minute of your time?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,278,I've been treating your wounded men.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,279,"And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,280,They're not my enemies.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,281,That's what I tell my bannermen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,282,I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,283,"Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,284,But some are not.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,285,I need silk for stitching.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,286,"I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,287,You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,288,I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,289,- If you need help finding these... - I know where to find them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,290,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,291,"Continue, my lady."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,292,You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,293,Yes.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,294,The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,295,I expect he will.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,296,If I could write a list.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,297,Come with me to the Crag.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,298,I don't think that will be...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,299,Let the maester show you his stores.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,300,"I want the wounded men to be treated well,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,301,all the wounded men.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,302,"- Children, come inside, quick. - Come on."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,303,Hurry up!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,304,"Can't find anything, ser."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,305,- They've lost the scent. - Try again.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,306,We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,307,"We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,308,I'm looking at spending the rest of my life
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,309,being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,310,"Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,311,The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,312,I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,313,"And once I've got them, the pampered little shits..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,314,It's better to be cruel than weak.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,315,Prince Theon.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,316,"- Where are they? - Who, m'lord?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,317,The Stark boys. Where are they?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,318,I don't know. I seen no one.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,319,Think harder.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,320,"I swear, m'lord. I don't know."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,321,"My lord, over here."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,322,I think I've found what we're looking for.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,323,Send the old man home.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,324,Go back to Winterfell.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,325,Take him back.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,326,"Theon, don't do this."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,327,- You came back. - As soon as I heard.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,328,Do you know anything?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,329,- Irri is dead. - I know.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,330,- She was a good... - She's dead.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,331,She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,332,Doreah?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,333,We can't find her.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,334,"She must be dead, too."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,335,I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,336,I should have been here.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,337,You went to find me a ship.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,338,My place is by your side.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,339,I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,340,"""These people""?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,341,They are not to be trusted.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,342,And who is to be trusted?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,343,Who are my people?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,344,The Targaryens?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,345,"I only knew one, my brother,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,346,and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,347,The Dothraki?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,348,Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,349,Your people are in Westeros.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,350,The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,351,- They will soon enough. - And then what?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,352,They'll pray for my return?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,353,They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,354,That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,355,You are not your brother.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,356,"Trust me, Khaleesi."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,357,There it is.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,358,"""Trust me."""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,359,"And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,360,Only you?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,361,I don't need trust any longer.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,362,I don't want it and I don't have room for it.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,363,- You are too young to be so... - And you are too familiar.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,364,"Forgive me, Khaleesi."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,365,No one can survive in this world without help. No one.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,366,"Let me help you, please."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,367,Tell me how.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,368,Find my dragons.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,369,How long till we get back to your crows?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,370,We're close.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,371,"What, a day? A half-day?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,372,"You don't know, do you?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,373,- Do you even know where they are? - We're close.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,374,What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,375,Nothing happened between you and me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,376,"""I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,377,"""we were only close together for warmth."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,378,"""And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,379,"""I can show you the bruise on me tailbone."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,380,"""And before I knew what was where, his... his..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,381,"""Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,382,"""And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did!"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,383,"""And he spread me legs and ruined."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,384,"""The shame of it."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,385,"""Now I can never marry a perfumed lord."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,386,"""What will me poor savage father say?"""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,387,Turn back around.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,388,"""And I thought that we were done, but he said,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,389,"""'Turn back around.""'"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,390,"I'll tell you what, Jon Snow."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,391,"Since it's gonna be your word against mine,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,392,"and since you can't talk about it without blushing,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,393,we may as well just...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,394,"What, right here in the muck?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,395,I'll keep you warm enough.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,396,Are you that afraid of it?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,397,That's enough.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,398,It's nice
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,399,and wet
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,400,and warm.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,401,Enough!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,402,It don't have teeth.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,403,All right!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,404,All right.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,405,"Gods, you're dull."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,406,Should have took me while you had the chance.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,407,"No, no!"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,408,"No. Oh, no."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,409,It's all right. Give me that.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,410,"If the queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,411,Help me flip it over.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,412,- Where are you going? - To tell Her Grace.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,413,You'll say nothing to anyone.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,414,Do you understand?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,415,Your mother might have prepared you.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,416,"You flowered, my dear. No more."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,417,"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,418,In what way?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,419,I thought it would be less...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,420,Less messy.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,421,Wait until you birth a child.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,422,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,423,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,424,"A prospect that once delighted you,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,425,"bringing little princes and princesses into the world,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,426,the greatest honour for a queen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,427,Joffrey has always been difficult.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,428,"Even his birth, I laboured a day and a half to bring him into this world."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,429,You cannot imagine the pain.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,430,"I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,431,His Grace was not with you?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,432,Robert was hunting.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,433,That was his custom.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,434,"Whenever my time was near,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,435,my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,436,"And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,437,and I would present him with a baby.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,438,"Not that I wanted him there, mind you."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,439,"I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,440,"When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,441,he smiled
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,442,and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,443,Joffrey will show you no such devotion.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,444,"You may never love the king,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,445,but you will love his children.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,446,I love His Grace with all my heart.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,447,That's so very touching to hear.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,448,Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,449,"The more people you love, the weaker you are."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,450,You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,451,"You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,452,Love no one but your children.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,453,"On that front, a mother has no choice."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,454,"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,455,"You can try,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,456,little dove.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,457,Who did you say your mother was again?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,458,Cinda Lannister.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,459,Is she the fat one?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,460,"Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,461,"No, no. There's only one fat Lannister."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,462,"If she was your mother, you'd know it."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,463,"I squired for you once, you know."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,464,When?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,465,"The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,466,I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,467,You did.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,468,Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,469,He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,470,Bryan.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,471,Poor lad.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,472,"That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,473,I remember you.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,474,You'd never squired for anyone before.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,475,"That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,476,My father was furious.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,477,Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,478,"You didn't, though."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,479,You really remember?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,480,You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,481,"Most of my squires,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,482,"they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,483,- When I think back to that day... - Shh!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,484,You were saying?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,485,I...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,486,Never mind. It's embarrassing.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,487,More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,488,"I remember everything about that day,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,489,"your helmet, your horse,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,490,"the rake lines in the dirt along the list,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,491,"where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,492,and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,493,I'll remember it all until I die.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,494,That was the best day of my life.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,495,And I remember being on the field after it was over.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,496,All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,497,And I couldn't leave.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,498,I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,499,you could barely even see the bride.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,500,"And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,501,when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,502,I understand completely.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,503,How could you?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,504,"Sorry, I... I didn't mean to doubt you. It's just that I..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,505,I was 16 once.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,506,I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,507,Which knight was it?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,508,Barristan Selmy.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,509,The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,510,What was he like?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,511,He was...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,512,A painter.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,513,A painter who only used red.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,514,"I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,515,"And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,516,"I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,517,It's hard to put into words.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,518,It's like
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,519,"stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,520,and finding out that the dream
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,521,is more real than your life.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,522,Leaving that battlefield was
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,523,like being dragged off to prison.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,524,- Did you squire for him again? - No.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,525,I didn't have your gift.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,526,He couldn't take a step without stepping on me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,527,"I was awful, a complete liability."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,528,Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,529,It's a good thing I am who I am.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,530,I'd have been useless at anything else.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,531,I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,532,"Shocking, I know."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,533,Some men are.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,534,"Ned Stark,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,535,I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,536,"Not me, though."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,537,My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,538,And have you thought about...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,539,Of course. Every day.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,540,And?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,541,"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,542,The Starks are very careful.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,543,"But there is a way, I think."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,544,It wasn't possible until now.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,545,What is it?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,546,"- It's actually quite simple. - Well, let me help you."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,547,You'll only have to do one thing.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,548,Tell me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,549,You'll have to die.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,550,Jorah the Andal.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,551,This man must sail past old Valyria.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,552,All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,553,I didn't come here for lessons.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,554,"No, you came for the dragons."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,555,You have them?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,556,Where are they?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,557,Draw your sword.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,558,See what your steel is worth.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,559,You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,560,You love her.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,561,Where are the dragons?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,562,"Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,563,Will you betray her again?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,564,Never.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,565,The thief you seek
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,566,is with her now.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,567,I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,568,No one is calling you a thief.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,569,Who is she to accuse us?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,570,"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,571,Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,572,"Without me, the dragons will die."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,573,It will be for the best.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,574,"Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,575,"If I knew where they were, I would not tell you."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,576,"You are cruel, my friend."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,577,The Mother of Dragons is in the right.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,578,She must be reunited with her babies.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,579,"- I will help you, Khaleesi. - How?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,580,I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,581,You have my dragons?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,582,"When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,583,He procured them for me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,584,But there is no King of Qarth.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,585,There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,586,"You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,587,but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,588,I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,589,Your ambition is an inspiration.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,590,"But like all upstarts, you overreach."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,591,Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,592,do not make you a king.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,593,An upstart and a charlatan?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,594,Empires have been built by less.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,595,"Those on the margins often come to control the centre,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,596,"and those in the centre make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,597,The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,598,"She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,599,forever.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,600,A mother should be with her children.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,601,"Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,602,Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,603,Come see them.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,604,- Lady Stark! - No farther.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,605,"Keep your hands off me, woman."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,606,"Don't enter without an invitation, man."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,607,Forgive me. Lady Stark.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,608,- What is it? - They caught the Kingslayer.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,609,Kingslayer!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,610,- Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him! - Hang him!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,611,You'll die today.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,612,Justice for the Karstark.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,613,Gut him!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,614,Get back! I want his head!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,615,Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,616,"Lord Karstark,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,617,this man is our prisoner.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,618,This monster killed my son.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,619,And crippled mine.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,620,"He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,621,I will have his head. And if you try and stop me...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,622,You will strike me down?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,623,"Have you forgotten me, ser?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,624,"I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,625,I am the mother of your king!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,626,- And where is our king now? - You know very well.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,627,He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,628,"Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,629,- He brought that foreign bitch with him. - How dare you!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,630,- Threatening my lady is an act of treason. - Treason?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,631,How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,632,"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,633,"But in the name of my son, the King in the North,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,634,stand down.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,635,"When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,636,Wise men do not make demands of kings.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,637,Fathers who love their sons do.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,638,I will have his head.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,639,"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,640,"I would have come to your defence, but..."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,641,Take him to the stockades.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,642,Bind him with every chain you can find!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,643,You've become a real she-wolf in your later years.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,644,There's not much fish left in you.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,645,And gag him!
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,646,Since when do you light your own candles?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,647,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,648,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,649,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,650,"- More than we have. - Yes, that's more than we have."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,651,"He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,652,"We have strong, high walls."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,653,We'll rain fire down on them from above.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,654,"""Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,655,Why not?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,656,"He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,657,"Call it tactics, not strategy."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,658,"But, yes, he does have a good mind for it."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,659,"The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,660,"It's just you, me and Joffrey,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,661,the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,662,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,663,He needs to start acting like a king.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,664,This war you started is coming to our doorstep.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,665,And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,666,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,667,I thought the girls might help him.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,668,- Did you? - I was wrong.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,669,If we can't control him...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,670,Do you think I haven't tried?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,671,He doesn't listen to me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,672,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,673,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,674,He looks like him.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,675,In a certain light.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,676,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,677,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,678,Sometimes I wonder.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,679,What?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,680,If this is the price
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,681,"for what we've done,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,682,for our sins.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,683,Sins?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,684,The Targaryens...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,685,"Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,686,That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,687,It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,688,"Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,689,What's the saying?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,690,"""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,691,You've beaten the odds.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,692,"Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,693,- Then why wait? - We're sworn to the king.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,694,- There's not a king. - That's treason.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,695,"So is saving Lannisters, yeah?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,696,"- Back off, you. - No, I won't."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,697,"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,698,So they say.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,699,The Kingslayer won't last the night.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,700,"The more they drink, the angrier they'll get."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,701,And when the Karstarks draw their swords...
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,702,Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,703,Come.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,704,He'll not be making it through the night.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,705,I need to be alone with him.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,706,"- My lady, our orders... - Your orders, which I just gave you,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,707,are to leave me alone with him.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,708,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,709,I believe it's my last night in this world.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,710,Is that a woman?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,711,Do you hear them out there?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,712,They want your head.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,713,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,714,You strangled his son with your chains.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,715,Oh. Oh.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,716,Was he the one on guard duty?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,717,He was in my way.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,718,- Any knight would have done the same. - You are no knight.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,719,You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,720,So many vows.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,721,They make you swear and swear.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,722,"Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,723,"protect the innocent, defend the weak."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,724,But what if your father despises the king?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,725,What if the king massacres the innocent?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,726,It's too much.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,727,"No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,728,Where did you find this beast?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,729,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,730,- Kingslayer. - Kingslayer.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,731,What a king he was.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,732,"Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,733,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,734,and to the sword I shoved in his back.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,735,You are a man without honour.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,736,"Do you know,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,737,I've never been with any woman but Cersei.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,738,"So in my own way,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,739,I have more honour than
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,740,poor old dead Ned.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,741,What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,742,"- Brienne. - No, that wasn't it."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,743,"Snow, a bastard from the North."
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,744,"Now, when... When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,745,did you pretend to love it?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,746,No.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,747,You're not very good at pretending.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,748,You're an honest woman.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,749,"You hated that boy, didn't you?"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,750,How could you not hate him?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,751,"The walking, talking reminder"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,752,that the honourable Lord Eddard Stark
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,753,fucked another woman.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,754,Your sword.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,755,I told you what would happen.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,756,All of you.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,757,I told you what would happen if you served me loyally.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,758,And what would happen if you did not.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,759,What are you doing? What have you done?
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,760,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says,"
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,761,here is the answer to your question.
S02E07,A Man Without Honor,762,No!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,1,- Riders approaching! - Open the gate!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,2,"Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,3,- Envy isn't attractive. - What envy?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,4,You should be proud of your brother's achievement.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,5,I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,6,You're a great warrior.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,7,I saw the bodies above your gates.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,8,"Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,9,"I treated the Stark boys with honour, and they repaid me with treachery."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,10,You treated them with honour? By butchering them?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,11,"Before I had to kill them,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,12,"- I treated them... - You seized their home, as is your right."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,13,"We're ironborn, we take what we need."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,14,Exactly.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,15,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,16,Is that treachery?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,17,I'd call it bravery.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,18,- They made me a promise... - Your little boy prisoners made you a promise
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,19,and you got mad when they broke it?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,20,Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,21,- Don't call me... - A cunt.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,22,A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,23,You know how valuable those boys were?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,24,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,25,You are weak. And you're stupid.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,26,I'm warning you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,27,"Go on, then. Warn me."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,28,You haven't brought enough men.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,29,How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,30,You're not.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,31,I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,32,Is this a joke?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,33,Winterfell is the heart of the North.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,34,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,35,"We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,36,Our power comes from our ships.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,37,"And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,38,every man in the North wants to see you hanged.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,39,- When Robb Stark finds out... - He won't find out.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,40,We've killed all the ravens.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,41,We have all the horses.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,42,I've taken Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,43,And I will keep Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,44,Leave us.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,45,"Theon, you're my blood."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,46,We both loved our mother.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,47,We both endured our father.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,48,Come home with me. Don't die here alone.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,49,I don't intend to die.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,50,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,51,"Bawling all the time, never sleeping."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,52,"And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,53,screaming like a dying pig.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,54,"I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,55,I wanted to strangle you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,56,And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,57,You smiled at me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,58,Don't die so far from the sea.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,59,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,60,I already got one crow. Don't need two.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,61,Mance will want to question this one.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,62,Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,63,The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,64,Gut him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,65,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,66,And now he wishes he did.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,67,Gut him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,68,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,69,Mance will want him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,70,What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,71,I don't know.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,72,I think he'll want to decide for himself.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,73,"He runs, I'll chop his balls off."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,74,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,75,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,76,I couldn't do it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,77,"I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't..."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,78,I know.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,79,The others?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,80,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,81,We found your tracks fast enough.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,82,But they found us before we found you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,83,They died because of me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,84,See that it wasn't for nothing.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,85,"All right, up, lad."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,86,"Come on, on your feet, now."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,87,Move it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,88,Is she beautiful?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,89,I've never met her.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,90,What's her name?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,91,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,92,I'm sure you'll be very happy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,93,And you're marrying her for a bridge?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,94,- An important bridge. - Ah.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,95,It was before they killed my father.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,96,"I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,97,but only if I crossed that bridge.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,98,"When I speak to people from the North,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,99,they all loved your father.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,100,He was the best man I ever met.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,101,"I know children always think that about their fathers, but..."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,102,"Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,103,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,104,except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,105,The farmers ploughing the fields are yours to protect.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,106,"The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,107,The soldiers you order into battle.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,108,He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,109,I didn't believe him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,110,"I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"""
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,111,"""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,112,I wish I could have met him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,113,He would have liked you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,114,Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,115,than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,116,- He didn't care much about gold or glory. - And you?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,117,You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,118,I want to go home.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,119,- I want the men following me to go home. - Then why don't you?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,120,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,121,And because I believe in justice.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,122,"- Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean. - That would be a start."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,123,"Your Grace, milady."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,124,"The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,125,How?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,126,How?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,127,Tell me this isn't true.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,128,Why?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,129,For the girls.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,130,- You betrayed me. - Robb...
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,131,No!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,132,You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,133,Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,134,Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,135,"I have five children, and only one of them is free."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,136,I lost one son fighting by your son's side.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,137,"I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,138,You commit treason because your children are prisoners?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,139,"I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,140,if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,141,"- I grieve for your sons, my lord. - I don't want your grief."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,142,I want my vengeance.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,143,And you stole it from me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,144,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,145,but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,146,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,147,You've weakened our position.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,148,You've brought discord into our camp.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,149,And you did it all behind my back.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,150,- Make sure she's guarded day and night. - Robb.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,151,How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,152,"Forty, Your Grace."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,153,Send another 40 with our fastest horses.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,154,Robb.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,155,Damn.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,156,You're much uglier in daylight.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,157,What's your name?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,158,"I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,159,A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,160,Brienne of Tarth.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,161,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,162,Crescent moons and starbursts.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,163,Lord...
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,164,Selwyn Tarth. Your father.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,165,"Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,166,It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,167,Have you known many men?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,168,I suppose not.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,169,Women?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,170,Horses? Ah.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,171,"I didn't mean to give offence, my lady. Forgive me."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,172,"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,173,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,174,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,175,"the weak, the innocent."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,176,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,177,You will not provoke me to anger.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,178,I already have. Look at you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,179,You're ready to chop my head off.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,180,Do you think you could?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,181,Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,182,I've never seen you fight.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,183,The answer is no.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,184,There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,185,You're not one of them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,186,All my life men like you have sneered at me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,187,And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,188,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,189,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,190,"I took you for a fighter, a man..."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,191,Pardon. Woman of honour.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,192,Was I wrong?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,193,You're afraid.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,194,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,195,King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,196,It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,197,Surrender the Iron Throne?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,198,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,199,Stannis will execute them all.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,200,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,201,He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,202,"Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,203,The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,204,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,205,he lured us into a trap.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,206,Which is why my son is his prisoner.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,207,Too close to Casterly Rock.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,208,He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,209,The Greyjoys have done us a great favour.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,210,Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,211,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,212,He'll risk anything at any time
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,213,because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,214,We'll ride at nightfall.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,215,I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,216,"Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,217,Track down this brotherhood and destroy them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,218,The girl has proven herself a good servant.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,219,She'll stay on with you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,220,See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,221,"He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,222,You've got some questions to answer.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,223,Who killed Ser Amory?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,224,- I don't know! Please! - Give me the name.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,225,"- Take this one out for the crows. - I told you, I don't know."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,226,Please.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,227,"Look, it's Yoren's little cunt."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,228,"Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,229,Where's Jaqen?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,230,Don't care.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,231,"Where's your stick now, bitch?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,232,I promised to fuck you with it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,233,"Come on, time to kill some wolves."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,234,You need sour cherries to make it right.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,235,"And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,236,That's where the real flavour is. You crush 'em up real fine.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,237,"And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,238,Where's Jaqen?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,239,- How would I know? - I need him now.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,240,- Lord Tywin's marching tonight. - You need him?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,241,He's helping me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,242,- I saw him. - Where?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,243,- Where? Where? - Ow!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,244,They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,245,On patrol.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,246,Let go of my ears.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,247,What do you want with him anyway?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,248,Mance is gonna march on the Wall.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,249,"When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,250,- They'll never trust me. - They might.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,251,- If you do what needs to be done. - What?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,252,How does it feel knowing those men all died
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,253,so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,254,"- I didn't. - I should have known better,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,255,trusting a traitor's bastard.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,256,"He's not yours to kill, crow."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,257,Do you have to do that here?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,258,I like to keep me hands clean.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,259,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,260,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,261,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,262,You're commander of the City Watch.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,263,- You shouldn't be dressed like a common... - A cloak slows you down in a fight.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,264,Makes it hard to move quietly.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,265,"And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,266,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,267,You're supposed to stand out.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,268,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,269,"Fine, fine."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,270,No gold cloak.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,271,What?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,272,- What? - What? What?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,273,Why are you staring at me?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,274,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,275,Why am I here?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,276,To help me plan the defence of King's Landing.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,277,Stannis will be here any day.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,278,And one of these explains how to beat him?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,279,"""An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros."""
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,280,By Archmaester Shevelathin.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,281,Shevelatesh.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,282,Chevalteesh.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,283,I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,284,My Lord Hand. Commander.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,285,I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,286,these last few weeks.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,287,Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,288,I did not know.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,289,And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,290,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,291,For questioning?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,292,No.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,293,It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,294,"- We talked about this. - Aye, we talked about it."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,295,Have you ever been in a city under siege?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,296,Maybe this part's not in your books.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,297,"See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,298,Food's worth more than gold.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,299,Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,300,"Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,301,"The thieves, they love a siege."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,302,"Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,303,"By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,304,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,305,Ah.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,306,"""The Great Sieges of Westeros."""
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,307,Thrilling subject.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,308,Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,309,Stannis knows King's Landing.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,310,"He knows where the walls are strongest,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,311,and he knows which gates are weakest.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,312,The Mud Gate.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,313,"A good ram will batter it down in minutes,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,314,and it's only 50 yards from the water.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,315,That's where he'll land.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,316,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,317,what is our plan?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,318,We could throw books at his men.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,319,We don't have that many books.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,320,"We don't have that many men, either."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,321,What do we have?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,322,Pig shit.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,323,I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,324,I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,325,We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,326,I can't imagine anything much worse.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,327,You lack imagination.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,328,Where do you think Jon is right now?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,329,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,330,A betting man would go with dead.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,331,He's not dead.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,332,"No, Jon's a great fighter."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,333,"Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,334,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,335,So did his father.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,336,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,337,Great rangers never get old is the problem.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,338,Shit ones neither.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,339,It's them in the middle that last a long time.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,340,What in seven hells is that?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,341,The First Men made these marks.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,342,Help me with it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,343,Look.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,344,"If you find something you're not supposed to,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,345,best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,346,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,347,It's been here a long time.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,348,Oh.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,349,Must be dragonglass.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,350,Dragonglass?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,351,The maesters call it obsidian.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,352,Why would a brother hide it here?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,353,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,354,Mind where you're going.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,355,I'm sorry. I'll...
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,356,Where were you?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,357,A man has patrol duty.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,358,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,359,A girl owes one more name.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,360,The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,361,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,362,"A minute, an hour, a month."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,363,"Death is certain,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,364,the time is not.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,365,He's taking his army to attack my brother.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,366,I need him dead right now.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,367,This a man cannot do.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,368,You promised you'd help me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,369,"Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,370,"There must be others. Give a name, any name."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,371,And you'll kill them?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,372,Anybody?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,373,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,374,I swear it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,375,All right.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,376,Jaqen H'ghar.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,377,A girl gives a man his own name?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,378,- That's right. - Gods are not mocked.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,379,- This is no joking thing. - I'm not joking.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,380,A man can go kill himself.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,381,Un-name me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,382,- No. - Please?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,383,I'll un-name you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,384,- Thank you. - If you help me and my friends escape.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,385,This would require more than one life.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,386,"- This is not part of our bargain. - Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,387,A girl lacks honour.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,388,"If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,389,A girl will obey.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,390,A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,391,"Thank you, Podrick."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,392,Odd little boy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,393,I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,394,You and Varys both.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,395,Excellent lamprey pie.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,396,Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,397,I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,398,An inspiration for the troops.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,399,The young king in his shining armour
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,400,fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,401,He's only a boy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,402,Younger boys are off fighting his war.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,403,"- He's not ready. - What is he, 17?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,404,- Remember Jaime at 17? - Better than you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,405,"Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,406,some don't.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,407,His place is not on the battlefield.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,408,"It's not on the throne, either,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,409,sadly for all of us.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,410,Do you think I'm an idiot?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,411,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,412,You shipped off my only daughter.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,413,And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,414,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,415,He has the finest armour gold can buy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,416,He needs to be out there.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,417,The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,418,instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,419,Any dessert?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,420,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,421,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,422,Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,423,Because he doesn't have a cock.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,424,Neither do you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,425,"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,426,"You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,427,That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,428,It's not that little.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,429,Why are you smiling?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,430,Because I'm happy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,431,And why are you happy?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,432,Because I have your little whore.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,433,I thought you preferred blondes.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,434,Such a droll little fellow.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,435,"Tell me, have you married this one yet?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,436,No?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,437,Good. Father will be so pleased.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,438,Why do you care who I fuck?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,439,Because a Lannister always pays her debts.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,440,"You stole my only daughter,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,441,you plot to have Joffrey killed.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,442,This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,443,- You need me. - For what?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,444,Your skill in battle?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,445,"Pretty thing, your whore."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,446,Lovely body.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,447,The bruises will heal in time.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,448,Where did you find her?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,449,Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,450,"Really, a Lannister lion necklace?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,451,You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,452,You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,453,Oh?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,454,"Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,455,"You don't buy them,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,456,you only rent them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,457,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,458,This one you like.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,459,You like her very much.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,460,Could it be love?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,461,"Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,462,Unless Joffrey is hurt.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,463,"And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,464,"And if he dies,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,465,there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,466,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,467,Would you like to see her?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,468,I thought you might.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,469,"Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,470,I'm sorry they hurt you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,471,You must be brave.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,472,I promise I will free you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,473,Don't forget me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,474,Never.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,475,I will hurt you for this.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,476,"A day will come when you think you're safe and happy,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,477,and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,478,And you will know the debt is paid.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,479,Get out.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,480,Shae!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,481,I've been waiting all night.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,482,What is wrong?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,483,You're beautiful.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,484,Then why do you look sad?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,485,We have to be more careful.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,486,Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,487,There are people who want to hurt me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,488,I know. I won't let them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,489,I'll cut off their faces. I will.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,490,I would kill for you. Do you know that?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,491,I expect I'll have to before this is over.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,492,You're mine.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,493,I'm yours.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,494,Promise me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,495,"I'm yours, and you are mine."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,496,Still no word?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,497,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,498,My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,499,- Once he captures the castle... - Theon has my brothers.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,500,- If we storm the castle... - He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,501,They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,502,Send word to your son.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,503,Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,504,"A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much..."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,505,Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,506,He betrayed our cause.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,507,He betrayed me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,508,And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,509,I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,510,"Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,511,My lady.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,512,How are you?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,513,How am I?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,514,I've had to arrest my mother.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,515,The Lannisters have my sisters.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,516,The man I considered my closest friend
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,517,has seized my home and my brothers.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,518,I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,519,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,520,No.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,521,Forgive me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,522,You're being kind.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,523,- I have no right. - You have every right.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,524,You're a king.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,525,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,526,What kind do you want to be?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,527,I don't know.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,528,The good kind.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,529,Most kings grew up as princes.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,530,They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,531,I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,532,"I was raised to be a proper little lady,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,533,to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,534,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,535,"No. No, you would not."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,536,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,537,to sawing off men's feet?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,538,"When I was 12,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,539,my mother and father went to a wedding.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,540,"Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,541,And they left me with my little brother.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,542,The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,543,"We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,544,Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,545,"The rich, the poor, we were all there."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,546,"Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,547,Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,548,"I was treading water,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,549,"talking to a friend,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,550,when I realised I hadn't seen my brother.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,551,I called his name.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,552,Then I started screaming his name.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,553,And then I saw him...
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,554,floating face down.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,555,My heart just... stopped.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,556,I was...
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,557,I dragged him from the water.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,558,"My friend helped me, I think."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,559,I don't even remember.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,560,He was so little.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,561,Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,562,And I screamed at him and I shook him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,563,And he was dead.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,564,Just dead.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,565,A man ran over.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,566,He had a fish tattoo on his face.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,567,"In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,568,So you know what they are without having to talk to them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,569,And this man worked on a fishing boat.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,570,And he pushed me out of the way.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,571,"You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,572,"that's death for the man, a terrible death."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,573,"But he pushed me out of the way,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,574,and he started pressing on my brother's chest
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,575,"again and again and again,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,576,until my brother spat out
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,577,half of the Rhoyne and cried out.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,578,And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,579,I decided two things that day.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,580,I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,581,"And when I came of age,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,582,I would never live in a slave city again.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,583,"I'm sorry, Your Grace."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,584,You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,585,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,586,I don't want you to marry her.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,587,But you needed that bridge.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,588,I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,589,The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,590,Shut up.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,591,Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,592,"The nice, warm oven."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,593,Shut up. What did you bring?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,594,The cheese could be better.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,595,I did get some nice sausages.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,596,What did he want us to do about those guards?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,597,He didn't say.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,598,"He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,599,What about the guards?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,600,He didn't say anything about the guards.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,601,"What, he left that bit out?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,602,"It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,603,We have to trust him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,604,Trust him?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,605,You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,606,- I want to go back to the kitchens. - Shut up.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,607,Stay here if you're afraid.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,608,"Arry, don't."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,609,Away!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,610,Reset!
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,611,"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,612,Will it hold?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,613,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,614,"Again, pull!"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,615,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,616,"I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,617,Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,618,"So you take the onion for your sigil,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,619,"sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,620,My son wishes me to change it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,621,"Three mermen with tridents, something like that."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,622,I understand why the older families look down at me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,623,Do you? Why?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,624,- My father was a crabber. - And?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,625,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,626,Our hands stink.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,627,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,628,Many fought bravely for your brother.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,629,Many fought for the Mad King.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,630,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,631,Some are happy to do it to my face.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,632,We were forgotten.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,633,"Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,634,"The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,635,"liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,636,while I held Storm's End with 500 men.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,637,"- No one has forgotten, Your Grace. - No? Robert did."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,638,He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,639,- He was only a boy. - Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,640,"First, we ate the horses."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,641,"We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,642,"We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,643,Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,644,I do like dogs.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,645,Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,646,"The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,647,"She couldn't speak any more, she was so frail."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,648,And then you made it through the lines.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,649,Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,650,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,651,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,652,I was relieved they did not.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,653,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,654,"Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,655,"Insult or no, I gave it up."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,656,"Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,657,and I've always done my duty.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,658,"But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,659,"And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,660,"Your Grace,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,661,I pray I serve you well.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,662,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,663,You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,664,No man can be in all rooms at all times.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,665,"I have many little birds in the North, my lord,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,666,but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,667,The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,668,To strike?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,669,"My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,670,You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,671,"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,672,I'll ride out to greet him.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,673,"A brave choice, Your Grace."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,674,I'm sure your men will line up behind you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,675,They say Stannis never smiles.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,676,I'll give him a red smile
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,677,from ear to ear.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,678,Imagine Stannis' terror.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,679,I am trying.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,680,You're an intelligent man.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,681,I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,682,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,683,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,684,"I wish we could, too."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,685,What do you want?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,686,Tell me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,687,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,688,My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,689,My sister became queen at the age of 19.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,690,"When I reached manhood,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,691,my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,692,A most highborn plumber.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,693,The water never flowed better.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,694,And all the shit found its way to the sea.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,695,I never expected to have any real power.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,696,So when my father named me acting Hand...
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,697,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know?"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,698,Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,699,Honourable men.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,700,But they disdained the game and those who played.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,701,- You enjoy the game. - I do.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,702,Last thing I expected.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,703,And you play it well.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,704,I'd like to keep playing it.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,705,"If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,706,They say he burns his enemies alive to honour the Lord of Light.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,707,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,708,the Drowned God wants them drowned.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,709,Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,710,Where is the god of tits and wine?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,711,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,712,We should sail there immediately.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,713,"This morning, I heard a song"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,714,all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,715,Daenerys Targaryen lives.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,716,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,717,She has three dragons.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,718,"But even if what they say is true,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,719,it'll be years before they are fully grown.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,720,And then there will be nowhere to hide.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,721,"One game at a time, my friend."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,722,"Careful, Khaleesi."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,723,Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,724,I found one.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,725,A ship with a good captain.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,726,She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,727,Astapor?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,728,We cannot stay here.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,729,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,730,They're not your children.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,731,"I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them,"
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,732,but you didn't grow them in your womb.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,733,"They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,734,"And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,735,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,736,You know I would die for you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,737,I will never abandon you.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,738,"I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,739,Then serve me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,740,"If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,741,That's what the warlock wants.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,742,He told you so himself.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,743,"If you enter that place, you will never leave again."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,744,- His magic is strong. - And what of my magic?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,745,You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,746,What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,747,"Until my last breath, I will remember."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,748,After I have forgotten my mother's face.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,749,They are my children.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,750,And they are the only children I will ever have.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,751,Take me to them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,752,We should bury them.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,753,I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,754,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,755,As you say.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,756,But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,757,- What's this? - Gold for the farmer.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,758,For his trouble.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,759,His troubles are done.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,760,He's feeding the crops now.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,761,"His wife, too."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,762,"You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,763,Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,764,Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,765,Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,766,You're right
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,767,so far.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,768,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,769,Must have been the farmer's boys.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,770,He killed them and burned them
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,771,and passed them off as the little lords?
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,772,They mustn't know.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,773,Bran would blame himself.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,774,They'll never hear it from me.
S02E08,The Prince Of Winterfell,775,The little lads have suffered enough.
S02E09,Blackwater,1,That's it.
S02E09,Blackwater,2,The tide's against us.
S02E09,Blackwater,3,"Aye, but we have the wind."
S02E09,Blackwater,4,She'll blow us straight to the gates.
S02E09,Blackwater,5,You're coming home.
S02E09,Blackwater,6,King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.
S02E09,Blackwater,7,I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.
S02E09,Blackwater,8,And now I'm sailing right at them.
S02E09,Blackwater,9,This is the royal fleet.
S02E09,Blackwater,10,"And you're not a smuggler any more, you're the high captain."
S02E09,Blackwater,11,"Of course, there are... several royal fleets at the moment."
S02E09,Blackwater,12,Not after tonight.
S02E09,Blackwater,13,"When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne"
S02E09,Blackwater,14,and you will be his Hand.
S02E09,Blackwater,15,- Gods be good. - God.
S02E09,Blackwater,16,"Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
S02E09,Blackwater,17,- But not over them? - Over all of us.
S02E09,Blackwater,18,"The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon."
S02E09,Blackwater,19,They will be glad to see his head on a spike.
S02E09,Blackwater,20,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
S02E09,Blackwater,21,Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.
S02E09,Blackwater,22,Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.
S02E09,Blackwater,23,"Those walls have never been breached,"
S02E09,Blackwater,24,"and the men guarding the walls,"
S02E09,Blackwater,25,"when they see you, they don't see a liberator,"
S02E09,Blackwater,26,they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.
S02E09,Blackwater,27,I have faith in the Lord of Light.
S02E09,Blackwater,28,I have faith in our cause.
S02E09,Blackwater,29,And I have faith in my captain.
S02E09,Blackwater,30,"Are you afraid, my lion?"
S02E09,Blackwater,31,"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find."
S02E09,Blackwater,32,Of course I'm afraid.
S02E09,Blackwater,33,I won't let them hurt you.
S02E09,Blackwater,34,I'm a Lannister.
S02E09,Blackwater,35,I don't have a choice in all this.
S02E09,Blackwater,36,But it's not your war.
S02E09,Blackwater,37,It is now.
S02E09,Blackwater,38,You can't fuck your way out of everything.
S02E09,Blackwater,39,I have so far.
S02E09,Blackwater,40,Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent?
S02E09,Blackwater,41,That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
S02E09,Blackwater,42,"As you know, Your Grace,"
S02E09,Blackwater,43,it is not only the sworn duty of a maester
S02E09,Blackwater,44,"to carry out the wishes of the house he serves,"
S02E09,Blackwater,45,but also to offer guidance
S02E09,Blackwater,46,and counsel in times of war.
S02E09,Blackwater,47,Your words are always wise and measured.
S02E09,Blackwater,48,"- If you could... - If anything,"
S02E09,Blackwater,49,a maester's duties become more urgent
S02E09,Blackwater,50,in times of war and turmoil.
S02E09,Blackwater,51,I remember back in the days of King...
S02E09,Blackwater,52,You brought me something?
S02E09,Blackwater,53,Yes.
S02E09,Blackwater,54,Essence of nightshade
S02E09,Blackwater,55,is as dangerous as it is efficacious.
S02E09,Blackwater,56,A single drop in a cup of wine
S02E09,Blackwater,57,suffices to soothe ragged nerves.
S02E09,Blackwater,58,Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep.
S02E09,Blackwater,59,"Ten drops, however..."
S02E09,Blackwater,60,I know what ten drops will bring.
S02E09,Blackwater,61,"Your Grace, if I may ask..."
S02E09,Blackwater,62,You may not.
S02E09,Blackwater,63,You must have a lot of work to do.
S02E09,Blackwater,64,I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
S02E09,Blackwater,65,Yes. A siege is very...
S02E09,Blackwater,66,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
S02E09,Blackwater,67,Your Grace.
S02E09,Blackwater,68,And so he spoke
S02E09,Blackwater,69,That Lord of Castamere
S02E09,Blackwater,70,But now the rains weep o'er his halls
S02E09,Blackwater,71,With no one there to hear
S02E09,Blackwater,72,"Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls"
S02E09,Blackwater,73,And not a soul to hear
S02E09,Blackwater,74,- Good boys! - Lannisters!
S02E09,Blackwater,75,Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
S02E09,Blackwater,76,Drunk Lannisters.
S02E09,Blackwater,77,You've got a pretty voice.
S02E09,Blackwater,78,Thank you very much.
S02E09,Blackwater,79,And I like your nose.
S02E09,Blackwater,80,How many times you break it?
S02E09,Blackwater,81,"Well, now let's see."
S02E09,Blackwater,82,"First time, I was five."
S02E09,Blackwater,83,- My mam smacked me with an iron poker. - Oh.
S02E09,Blackwater,84,It wasn't me she was aiming at.
S02E09,Blackwater,85,She was trying for my little brother.
S02E09,Blackwater,86,Now he was a real pest.
S02E09,Blackwater,87,"Second time, I was nine."
S02E09,Blackwater,88,Got in a scrap with a few older boys.
S02E09,Blackwater,89,They won.
S02E09,Blackwater,90,Third time...
S02E09,Blackwater,91,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
S02E09,Blackwater,92,Poor nose.
S02E09,Blackwater,93,Don't feel sorry for him.
S02E09,Blackwater,94,He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
S02E09,Blackwater,95,"Welcome, friends."
S02E09,Blackwater,96,This round's on me.
S02E09,Blackwater,97,I don't think he likes me.
S02E09,Blackwater,98,You think you're a hard man?
S02E09,Blackwater,99,I know it.
S02E09,Blackwater,100,It's warm in here.
S02E09,Blackwater,101,We've got beautiful women
S02E09,Blackwater,102,and good brown ale.
S02E09,Blackwater,103,Plenty for everyone.
S02E09,Blackwater,104,And all you want
S02E09,Blackwater,105,is to put one of us in the cold ground
S02E09,Blackwater,106,with no women to keep us company.
S02E09,Blackwater,107,"Oh, there's women in the ground."
S02E09,Blackwater,108,I put some there myself.
S02E09,Blackwater,109,So have you.
S02E09,Blackwater,110,You like fucking and drinking
S02E09,Blackwater,111,and singing.
S02E09,Blackwater,112,"But killing,"
S02E09,Blackwater,113,killing's the thing you love.
S02E09,Blackwater,114,You're just like me.
S02E09,Blackwater,115,Only smaller.
S02E09,Blackwater,116,And quicker.
S02E09,Blackwater,117,Eh?
S02E09,Blackwater,118,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
S02E09,Blackwater,119,Aye...
S02E09,Blackwater,120,I expect he will someday.
S02E09,Blackwater,121,Here we are.
S02E09,Blackwater,122,One more drink before the war?
S02E09,Blackwater,123,Shall we?
S02E09,Blackwater,124,I've always hated the bells.
S02E09,Blackwater,125,They ring for horror.
S02E09,Blackwater,126,"A dead king, a city under siege."
S02E09,Blackwater,127,- A wedding. - Exactly.
S02E09,Blackwater,128,"Podrick, is that it?"
S02E09,Blackwater,129,"""Is that it?"" Nice touch."
S02E09,Blackwater,130,As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.
S02E09,Blackwater,131,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
S02E09,Blackwater,132,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
S02E09,Blackwater,133,Do you trust him?
S02E09,Blackwater,134,"Oddly enough, I do."
S02E09,Blackwater,135,Good.
S02E09,Blackwater,136,The map you asked for.
S02E09,Blackwater,137,There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.
S02E09,Blackwater,138,Closer to 50.
S02E09,Blackwater,139,The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege
S02E09,Blackwater,140,and to provide escape if necessary.
S02E09,Blackwater,141,I'm not escaping.
S02E09,Blackwater,142,"Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship,"
S02E09,Blackwater,143,"and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
S02E09,Blackwater,144,That is good to hear.
S02E09,Blackwater,145,Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat.
S02E09,Blackwater,146,"You look well suited for battle, my lord."
S02E09,Blackwater,147,"Well, I'm not."
S02E09,Blackwater,148,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong."
S02E09,Blackwater,149,My little birds tell me
S02E09,Blackwater,150,that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.
S02E09,Blackwater,151,What of it?
S02E09,Blackwater,152,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
S02E09,Blackwater,153,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
S02E09,Blackwater,154,I think you believe in what you see
S02E09,Blackwater,155,and in what those you trust have seen.
S02E09,Blackwater,156,You probably don't entirely trust me.
S02E09,Blackwater,157,"Mmm, don't take it personally."
S02E09,Blackwater,158,I don't entirely trust myself.
S02E09,Blackwater,159,And yet I have seen things
S02E09,Blackwater,160,"and heard things,"
S02E09,Blackwater,161,"things you have not, things I wish I had not."
S02E09,Blackwater,162,I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.
S02E09,Blackwater,163,"No, I don't believe you have."
S02E09,Blackwater,164,"One day, I will."
S02E09,Blackwater,165,The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies
S02E09,Blackwater,166,and paved his path to our door.
S02E09,Blackwater,167,"For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne,"
S02E09,Blackwater,168,I can think of nothing worse.
S02E09,Blackwater,169,"And tonight,"
S02E09,Blackwater,170,I believe you are the only man who can stop him.
S02E09,Blackwater,171,They're welcoming the new king.
S02E09,Blackwater,172,I've never known bells to mean surrender.
S02E09,Blackwater,173,They want to play music with us? Let's play.
S02E09,Blackwater,174,- Drums. - Drums!
S02E09,Blackwater,175,"Remember, wait till the ships..."
S02E09,Blackwater,176,The ships are in the bay.
S02E09,Blackwater,177,"- They must be far enough in... - I know what ""in"" means."
S02E09,Blackwater,178,- Do you know how to use that? - I chopped wood once.
S02E09,Blackwater,179,"No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
S02E09,Blackwater,180,I saw you kill a man with a shield.
S02E09,Blackwater,181,You'll be unstoppable with an axe.
S02E09,Blackwater,182,"- Don't get killed. - Nor you, my friend."
S02E09,Blackwater,183,"- Oh, are we friends now? - Of course we are."
S02E09,Blackwater,184,Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
S02E09,Blackwater,185,"Enhances it, really."
S02E09,Blackwater,186,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
S02E09,Blackwater,187,Been spending time with fancy folks.
S02E09,Blackwater,188,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
S02E09,Blackwater,189,"- Shae. - Shae, yes."
S02E09,Blackwater,190,Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.
S02E09,Blackwater,191,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
S02E09,Blackwater,192,Sansa.
S02E09,Blackwater,193,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
S02E09,Blackwater,194,"Sansa, come here."
S02E09,Blackwater,195,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
S02E09,Blackwater,196,- Will you? - Just as I pray for the king's.
S02E09,Blackwater,197,"Stay safe, my lady."
S02E09,Blackwater,198,"And you, my lion."
S02E09,Blackwater,199,Your king rides forth to battle.
S02E09,Blackwater,200,You should see him off with a kiss.
S02E09,Blackwater,201,My new blade.
S02E09,Blackwater,202,"Hearteater, I've named it."
S02E09,Blackwater,203,Kiss it.
S02E09,Blackwater,204,You'll kiss it again when I return
S02E09,Blackwater,205,and taste my uncle's blood.
S02E09,Blackwater,206,Will you slay him yourself?
S02E09,Blackwater,207,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
S02E09,Blackwater,208,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
S02E09,Blackwater,209,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
S02E09,Blackwater,210,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid."
S02E09,Blackwater,211,Of course you'll be in the vanguard.
S02E09,Blackwater,212,They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest.
S02E09,Blackwater,213,And he is only a pretender.
S02E09,Blackwater,214,Your brother's turn will come.
S02E09,Blackwater,215,"Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
S02E09,Blackwater,216,Some of those boys will never come back.
S02E09,Blackwater,217,Joffrey will.
S02E09,Blackwater,218,- The worst ones always live. - Shh.
S02E09,Blackwater,219,"Come, my lady."
S02E09,Blackwater,220,Where's our fleet?
S02E09,Blackwater,221,On the way.
S02E09,Blackwater,222,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
S02E09,Blackwater,223,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
S02E09,Blackwater,224,The king has asked you a question.
S02E09,Blackwater,225,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
S02E09,Blackwater,226,The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king...
S02E09,Blackwater,227,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
S02E09,Blackwater,228,That would make me the quarterman.
S02E09,Blackwater,229,It just doesn't have the same ring to it.
S02E09,Blackwater,230,Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal.
S02E09,Blackwater,231,"No signal, no plan."
S02E09,Blackwater,232,"No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne,"
S02E09,Blackwater,233,puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere.
S02E09,Blackwater,234,"It might be quite amusing,"
S02E09,Blackwater,235,"except that my head would be up there, too."
S02E09,Blackwater,236,"I've never much liked my head,"
S02E09,Blackwater,237,but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
S02E09,Blackwater,238,Where are their ships?
S02E09,Blackwater,239,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
S02E09,Blackwater,240,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago.
S02E09,Blackwater,241,There are no surprises here.
S02E09,Blackwater,242,"If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,"
S02E09,Blackwater,243,maybe their sailors have mutinied.
S02E09,Blackwater,244,Maybe.
S02E09,Blackwater,245,I don't know why she wants me here.
S02E09,Blackwater,246,She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
S02E09,Blackwater,247,Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
S02E09,Blackwater,248,I doubt it.
S02E09,Blackwater,249,Maybe she's jealous of you.
S02E09,Blackwater,250,Why would she be jealous?
S02E09,Blackwater,251,Sansa.
S02E09,Blackwater,252,I was wondering where our little dove had flown.
S02E09,Blackwater,253,"You look pale, child."
S02E09,Blackwater,254,Is your red flower still blooming?
S02E09,Blackwater,255,Yes.
S02E09,Blackwater,256,"Fitting, isn't it?"
S02E09,Blackwater,257,The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here.
S02E09,Blackwater,258,Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
S02E09,Blackwater,259,"I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,260,So? I didn't offer you water.
S02E09,Blackwater,261,What's he doing here?
S02E09,Blackwater,262,Ser Ilyn?
S02E09,Blackwater,263,He's here to defend us.
S02E09,Blackwater,264,"When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
S02E09,Blackwater,265,But we have guards to defend us.
S02E09,Blackwater,266,Guards we have paid.
S02E09,Blackwater,267,"Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
S02E09,Blackwater,268,The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away
S02E09,Blackwater,269,with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
S02E09,Blackwater,270,The battle's first traitors.
S02E09,Blackwater,271,Have Ser Ilyn see to them.
S02E09,Blackwater,272,Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
S02E09,Blackwater,273,The only way to keep the small folk loyal
S02E09,Blackwater,274,is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.
S02E09,Blackwater,275,Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
S02E09,Blackwater,276,You said he was here to protect us.
S02E09,Blackwater,277,He is.
S02E09,Blackwater,278,Traitors are a danger to us all.
S02E09,Blackwater,279,More wine.
S02E09,Blackwater,280,There they are.
S02E09,Blackwater,281,"- Archers to their marks. - Archers, to your marks!"
S02E09,Blackwater,282,Archers!
S02E09,Blackwater,283,Nock your arrows!
S02E09,Blackwater,284,Nock arrows!
S02E09,Blackwater,285,- Hold fast. - Hold fast!
S02E09,Blackwater,286,What are you doing? We need to attack them.
S02E09,Blackwater,287,- Hold fast. - Boulders ready!
S02E09,Blackwater,288,Hold fast!
S02E09,Blackwater,289,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them?
S02E09,Blackwater,290,Where are the rest of them?
S02E09,Blackwater,291,There's only one ship.
S02E09,Blackwater,292,"Archers, stand to!"
S02E09,Blackwater,293,Man the below!
S02E09,Blackwater,294,- Nock. - Nock and set!
S02E09,Blackwater,295,Draw!
S02E09,Blackwater,296,Hold.
S02E09,Blackwater,297,Hold.
S02E09,Blackwater,298,There's no one on board.
S02E09,Blackwater,299,More rocks coming up!
S02E09,Blackwater,300,Hold.
S02E09,Blackwater,301,Wildfire.
S02E09,Blackwater,302,Steer clear! Steer clear!
S02E09,Blackwater,303,Matthos! Get down!
S02E09,Blackwater,304,- Prepare to land. - Your Grace.
S02E09,Blackwater,305,The dwarf has played his little trick.
S02E09,Blackwater,306,- The wildfire. - He can only play it once.
S02E09,Blackwater,307,We're too far from the gates.
S02E09,Blackwater,308,"The fire, their archers..."
S02E09,Blackwater,309,Hundreds will die.
S02E09,Blackwater,310,Thousands.
S02E09,Blackwater,311,Come with me and take this city!
S02E09,Blackwater,312,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
S02E09,Blackwater,313,My queen.
S02E09,Blackwater,314,What are you doing?
S02E09,Blackwater,315,Praying.
S02E09,Blackwater,316,"You're perfect, aren't you?"
S02E09,Blackwater,317,Praying.
S02E09,Blackwater,318,What are you praying for?
S02E09,Blackwater,319,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
S02E09,Blackwater,320,Oh.
S02E09,Blackwater,321,On all of us?
S02E09,Blackwater,322,"- Yes, Your Grace. - Even me?"
S02E09,Blackwater,323,"Of course, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,324,Even Joffrey?
S02E09,Blackwater,325,"- Joffrey is my... - Oh, shut up, you little fool."
S02E09,Blackwater,326,Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.
S02E09,Blackwater,327,The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods.
S02E09,Blackwater,328,My father told me that when he caught me praying.
S02E09,Blackwater,329,"My mother had just died, you see."
S02E09,Blackwater,330,"I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it."
S02E09,Blackwater,331,"I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,"
S02E09,Blackwater,332,the gods would return my mother to me. I was four.
S02E09,Blackwater,333,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
S02E09,Blackwater,334,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
S02E09,Blackwater,335,One for her.
S02E09,Blackwater,336,Here.
S02E09,Blackwater,337,Sit.
S02E09,Blackwater,338,Drink.
S02E09,Blackwater,339,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
S02E09,Blackwater,340,I should have been born a man.
S02E09,Blackwater,341,I'd rather face a thousand swords
S02E09,Blackwater,342,than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
S02E09,Blackwater,343,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
S02E09,Blackwater,344,"It was expected of me,"
S02E09,Blackwater,345,as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen.
S02E09,Blackwater,346,"If my wretched brother should somehow prevail,"
S02E09,Blackwater,347,these hens will return to their cocks
S02E09,Blackwater,348,"and crow of how my courage inspired them,"
S02E09,Blackwater,349,lifted their spirits.
S02E09,Blackwater,350,And if the city should fall?
S02E09,Blackwater,351,"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
S02E09,Blackwater,352,"The Red Keep should hold for a time,"
S02E09,Blackwater,353,long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person.
S02E09,Blackwater,354,"If it were anyone else outside those gates,"
S02E09,Blackwater,355,"I might have hoped for a private audience,"
S02E09,Blackwater,356,but this is Stannis Baratheon.
S02E09,Blackwater,357,I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.
S02E09,Blackwater,358,"Have I shocked you, little dove?"
S02E09,Blackwater,359,Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.
S02E09,Blackwater,360,The best one's between your legs.
S02E09,Blackwater,361,Learn how to use it. Drink.
S02E09,Blackwater,362,Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked?
S02E09,Blackwater,363,"No, you wouldn't, would you?"
S02E09,Blackwater,364,"If the city falls, these fine women"
S02E09,Blackwater,365,should be in for a bit of a rape.
S02E09,Blackwater,366,Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning.
S02E09,Blackwater,367,You'll be glad of your red flower then.
S02E09,Blackwater,368,"When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good."
S02E09,Blackwater,369,"A precious thing like you will look very, very good."
S02E09,Blackwater,370,A slice of cake
S02E09,Blackwater,371,just waiting to be eaten.
S02E09,Blackwater,372,More pressure!
S02E09,Blackwater,373,"- Pull! Pull! - That's it, men!"
S02E09,Blackwater,374,Pull! Pull!
S02E09,Blackwater,375,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
S02E09,Blackwater,376,They're coming. They're coming ashore.
S02E09,Blackwater,377,Rain fire on them.
S02E09,Blackwater,378,Archers!
S02E09,Blackwater,379,There are too many.
S02E09,Blackwater,380,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop"
S02E09,Blackwater,381,that manages to touch solid ground.
S02E09,Blackwater,382,"Pod, run to the King's Gate."
S02E09,Blackwater,383,"Bring any men guarding it here, now."
S02E09,Blackwater,384,"Yes, my lord."
S02E09,Blackwater,385,Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.
S02E09,Blackwater,386,"You, too."
S02E09,Blackwater,387,"Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me,"
S02E09,Blackwater,388,I'll strangle you with your own guts.
S02E09,Blackwater,389,"Pull, pull! Go!"
S02E09,Blackwater,390,Nock!
S02E09,Blackwater,391,Draw!
S02E09,Blackwater,392,- Draw! - Draw!
S02E09,Blackwater,393,Kill the Lannisters!
S02E09,Blackwater,394,- Loose! - Loose!
S02E09,Blackwater,395,- Draw! - Draw!
S02E09,Blackwater,396,- Loose! - Loose!
S02E09,Blackwater,397,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
S02E09,Blackwater,398,"First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!"
S02E09,Blackwater,399,"Any man dies with a clean sword,"
S02E09,Blackwater,400,I'll rape his fucking corpse.
S02E09,Blackwater,401,"When we were young, Jaime and I,"
S02E09,Blackwater,402,we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart.
S02E09,Blackwater,403,I could never understand why they treated us differently.
S02E09,Blackwater,404,"Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace,"
S02E09,Blackwater,405,and I was taught to smile
S02E09,Blackwater,406,and sing and please.
S02E09,Blackwater,407,"He was heir to Casterly Rock,"
S02E09,Blackwater,408,and I was sold to some stranger like a horse
S02E09,Blackwater,409,to be ridden whenever he desired.
S02E09,Blackwater,410,You were Robert's queen.
S02E09,Blackwater,411,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.
S02E09,Blackwater,412,I don't think I know this one.
S02E09,Blackwater,413,Pretty.
S02E09,Blackwater,414,That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.
S02E09,Blackwater,415,"Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four."
S02E09,Blackwater,416,Straighten your back and bend.
S02E09,Blackwater,417,Better. You learn fast.
S02E09,Blackwater,418,How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
S02E09,Blackwater,419,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,420,When did you leave Lorath?
S02E09,Blackwater,421,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
S02E09,Blackwater,422,But she was a nobleman's daughter.
S02E09,Blackwater,423,You're not.
S02E09,Blackwater,424,When did you come to Westeros?
S02E09,Blackwater,425,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,426,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years,"
S02E09,Blackwater,427,all without learning how to curtsy.
S02E09,Blackwater,428,I imagine that's a very interesting story.
S02E09,Blackwater,429,What's your name?
S02E09,Blackwater,430,"Shae, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,431,"Tell us a story, Shae."
S02E09,Blackwater,432,"When I was 13, I..."
S02E09,Blackwater,433,Your Grace!
S02E09,Blackwater,434,What news?
S02E09,Blackwater,435,The Imp has set the river afire.
S02E09,Blackwater,436,"Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more."
S02E09,Blackwater,437,"Stannis' fleet destroyed, but..."
S02E09,Blackwater,438,But...
S02E09,Blackwater,439,But his troops have landed outside the city walls.
S02E09,Blackwater,440,Where is Joffrey?
S02E09,Blackwater,441,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
S02E09,Blackwater,442,Bring him back inside at once.
S02E09,Blackwater,443,- Your Grace... - What?
S02E09,Blackwater,444,The king's presence is good for morale.
S02E09,Blackwater,445,Bring him back to his chambers now.
S02E09,Blackwater,446,- Not here? - With the women and children?
S02E09,Blackwater,447,Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
S02E09,Blackwater,448,"- No, but I... - Now!"
S02E09,Blackwater,449,"When I told you about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied."
S02E09,Blackwater,450,Do you want to hear the truth?
S02E09,Blackwater,451,You want to know why he's really here?
S02E09,Blackwater,452,He's here for us.
S02E09,Blackwater,453,"Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne,"
S02E09,Blackwater,454,but he will not take us alive.
S02E09,Blackwater,455,Help me!
S02E09,Blackwater,456,- Fall back! - Fall back!
S02E09,Blackwater,457,Get the ladders up!
S02E09,Blackwater,458,"Faster, you bastards! Faster!"
S02E09,Blackwater,459,"Come on, kill the scum!"
S02E09,Blackwater,460,Someone bring me a drink.
S02E09,Blackwater,461,Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
S02E09,Blackwater,462,Can I get you some iced milk
S02E09,Blackwater,463,"and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
S02E09,Blackwater,464,"Eat shit, dwarf."
S02E09,Blackwater,465,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
S02E09,Blackwater,466,I lost half my men.
S02E09,Blackwater,467,The Blackwater's on fire.
S02E09,Blackwater,468,"Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight."
S02E09,Blackwater,469,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane."
S02E09,Blackwater,470,You must beat them back or they're going to take this city.
S02E09,Blackwater,471,Your king's city.
S02E09,Blackwater,472,Fuck the Kingsguard.
S02E09,Blackwater,473,Fuck the city.
S02E09,Blackwater,474,Fuck the king.
S02E09,Blackwater,475,Loose!
S02E09,Blackwater,476,Put your backs into it!
S02E09,Blackwater,477,"All right, get up!"
S02E09,Blackwater,478,Loose!
S02E09,Blackwater,479,Clear!
S02E09,Blackwater,480,Forward!
S02E09,Blackwater,481,Loose!
S02E09,Blackwater,482,Forward ladders!
S02E09,Blackwater,483,Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,484,Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,485,"Your Grace,"
S02E09,Blackwater,486,the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.
S02E09,Blackwater,487,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
S02E09,Blackwater,488,What would you have me do?
S02E09,Blackwater,489,Lead.
S02E09,Blackwater,490,Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
S02E09,Blackwater,491,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
S02E09,Blackwater,492,"She did not say, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,493,All men to the battlements!
S02E09,Blackwater,494,"Ser Boros, Ser Mandon,"
S02E09,Blackwater,495,stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.
S02E09,Blackwater,496,"Archers, hold your line"
S02E09,Blackwater,497,or I'll kill you myself.
S02E09,Blackwater,498,Stand fast!
S02E09,Blackwater,499,No!
S02E09,Blackwater,500,"Get up, you fool."
S02E09,Blackwater,501,We need more arrows!
S02E09,Blackwater,502,Where is the king?
S02E09,Blackwater,503,- Why isn't he with us? - Who are we fighting for?
S02E09,Blackwater,504,Who leads us?
S02E09,Blackwater,505,I'll lead the attack.
S02E09,Blackwater,506,I'll lead the attack!
S02E09,Blackwater,507,- Yes. - What are you talking about?
S02E09,Blackwater,508,"Pod, my helmet."
S02E09,Blackwater,509,"Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner."
S02E09,Blackwater,510,"Men, form up."
S02E09,Blackwater,511,Men...
S02E09,Blackwater,512,Men!
S02E09,Blackwater,513,They say I'm half a man.
S02E09,Blackwater,514,But what does that make the lot of you?
S02E09,Blackwater,515,The only way out is through the gates.
S02E09,Blackwater,516,And they're at the gates.
S02E09,Blackwater,517,There's another way out. I'm going to show you.
S02E09,Blackwater,518,We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
S02E09,Blackwater,519,Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,520,Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,521,Don't fight for your king
S02E09,Blackwater,522,and don't fight for his kingdoms.
S02E09,Blackwater,523,Don't fight for honour. Don't fight for glory.
S02E09,Blackwater,524,"Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any."
S02E09,Blackwater,525,This is your city Stannis means to sack.
S02E09,Blackwater,526,That's your gate he's ramming.
S02E09,Blackwater,527,"If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,"
S02E09,Blackwater,528,"your gold he steals,"
S02E09,Blackwater,529,your women he will rape.
S02E09,Blackwater,530,Heave! Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,531,Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,532,Those are brave men knocking at our door.
S02E09,Blackwater,533,Let's go kill them.
S02E09,Blackwater,534,"The battle is lost, Your Grace."
S02E09,Blackwater,535,Stannis' troops are at the gates.
S02E09,Blackwater,536,"When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,"
S02E09,Blackwater,537,they lost all heart.
S02E09,Blackwater,538,Where is my son?
S02E09,Blackwater,539,I want to escort him back to the battle.
S02E09,Blackwater,540,Why do I care what you want?
S02E09,Blackwater,541,- Bring me... - Now listen to me...
S02E09,Blackwater,542,Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge.
S02E09,Blackwater,543,This is the safest place we can be.
S02E09,Blackwater,544,Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.
S02E09,Blackwater,545,His knights have rallied behind him.
S02E09,Blackwater,546,They will save the city.
S02E09,Blackwater,547,Shall we sing a hymn?
S02E09,Blackwater,548,"Gentle mother, font of mercy"
S02E09,Blackwater,549,"Save our sons from war, we pray"
S02E09,Blackwater,550,You must go.
S02E09,Blackwater,551,Run to your chamber and bar your door.
S02E09,Blackwater,552,Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
S02E09,Blackwater,553,- Come with me. - I need to say goodbye to someone.
S02E09,Blackwater,554,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
S02E09,Blackwater,555,No one is raping me.
S02E09,Blackwater,556,Go. Run.
S02E09,Blackwater,557,The lady is starting to panic.
S02E09,Blackwater,558,What are you doing here?
S02E09,Blackwater,559,Not here for long.
S02E09,Blackwater,560,- I'm going. - Where?
S02E09,Blackwater,561,Someplace that isn't burning.
S02E09,Blackwater,562,"North, might be."
S02E09,Blackwater,563,Could be.
S02E09,Blackwater,564,What about the king?
S02E09,Blackwater,565,He can die just fine on his own.
S02E09,Blackwater,566,I can take you with me.
S02E09,Blackwater,567,Take you to Winterfell.
S02E09,Blackwater,568,I'll keep you safe.
S02E09,Blackwater,569,Do you want to go home?
S02E09,Blackwater,570,I'll be safe here.
S02E09,Blackwater,571,Stannis won't hurt me.
S02E09,Blackwater,572,Look at me.
S02E09,Blackwater,573,Stannis is a killer.
S02E09,Blackwater,574,The Lannisters are killers.
S02E09,Blackwater,575,Your father was a killer.
S02E09,Blackwater,576,Your brother is a killer.
S02E09,Blackwater,577,Your sons will be killers someday.
S02E09,Blackwater,578,The world is built by killers.
S02E09,Blackwater,579,So you'd better get used to looking at them.
S02E09,Blackwater,580,You won't hurt me.
S02E09,Blackwater,581,"No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
S02E09,Blackwater,582,Heave!
S02E09,Blackwater,583,"Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!"
S02E09,Blackwater,584,Attack!
S02E09,Blackwater,585,Roll it over!
S02E09,Blackwater,586,Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
S02E09,Blackwater,587,"Oh, fuck me."
S02E09,Blackwater,588,Shh!
S02E09,Blackwater,589,"Be calm, my sweet."
S02E09,Blackwater,590,They're still fighting.
S02E09,Blackwater,591,No one's going to hurt you.
S02E09,Blackwater,592,I'll tell you a story.
S02E09,Blackwater,593,You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub?
S02E09,Blackwater,594,- They lived in the woods. - The Kingswood?
S02E09,Blackwater,595,"Yes, my love."
S02E09,Blackwater,596,"In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub."
S02E09,Blackwater,597,She loved him very much.
S02E09,Blackwater,598,But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.
S02E09,Blackwater,599,Like what?
S02E09,Blackwater,600,Like stags.
S02E09,Blackwater,601,Stags aren't evil.
S02E09,Blackwater,602,They only eat grass.
S02E09,Blackwater,603,And wolves.
S02E09,Blackwater,604,My lord.
S02E09,Blackwater,605,He could hear them howling in the night.
S02E09,Blackwater,606,The little cub was frightened.
S02E09,Blackwater,607,"His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."
S02E09,Blackwater,608,"""For one day, all the beasts will bow to you."
S02E09,Blackwater,609,"""You will be king."
S02E09,Blackwater,610,"""All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow."
S02E09,Blackwater,611,"""The bears in the north and the foxes of the south,"
S02E09,Blackwater,612,"""all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea,"
S02E09,Blackwater,613,"""they will all come to you, little lion,"
S02E09,Blackwater,614,"""to rest a crown upon your head."""
S02E09,Blackwater,615,"And the cub said,"
S02E09,Blackwater,616,"""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
S02E09,Blackwater,617,"""Yes,"" said his mother."
S02E09,Blackwater,618,"""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."""
S02E09,Blackwater,619,"I will keep you safe, my love."
S02E09,Blackwater,620,I promise you.
S02E09,Blackwater,621,Back to the boats!
S02E09,Blackwater,622,Stand and fight!
S02E09,Blackwater,623,"Stand and fight, damn you!"
S02E09,Blackwater,624,No!
S02E09,Blackwater,625,Father.
S02E09,Blackwater,626,The battle is over. We have won.
S02E09,Blackwater,627,"""And who are you,"" the proud lord said"
S02E09,Blackwater,628,"""That I must bow so low?"""
S02E09,Blackwater,629,"""Only a cat of a different coat"
S02E09,Blackwater,630,"""That's all the truth I know"
S02E09,Blackwater,631,"""In a coat of gold or a coat of red"
S02E09,Blackwater,632,"""A lion still has claws"
S02E09,Blackwater,633,"""And mine are long and sharp, my lord"
S02E09,Blackwater,634,"""As long and sharp as yours"""
S02E09,Blackwater,635,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
S02E09,Blackwater,636,That Lord of Castamere
S02E09,Blackwater,637,But now the rains weep o'er his hall
S02E09,Blackwater,638,With no one there to hear
S02E09,Blackwater,639,"Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall"
S02E09,Blackwater,640,And not a soul to hear
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,1,Pod.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,2,Pod!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,3,Find Bronn or Varys.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,4,Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,5,Tell them I am very much alive.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,6,"Yes, my lord."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,7,Would you like something for the pain?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,8,What happened?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,9,The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,10,suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,11,Where am I?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,12,These are your new chambers.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,13,"A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,14,You are no longer Hand of the King.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,15,For your trouble.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,16,"I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,17,"the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,18,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,19,"do hereby proclaim my grandfather,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,20,"Tywin Lannister, the saviour of the city and the Hand of the King."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,21,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,22,"Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,23,For your good service and ingenuity
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,24,"in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,25,I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,26,with all its attendant lands and incomes
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,27,to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,28,"You honour me beyond words, Your Grace."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,29,I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,30,Ser Loras Tyrell.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,31,Your house has come to our aid.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,32,"The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,33,"If your family would ask anything of me, ask it,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,34,and it shall be yours.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,35,"Your Grace,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,36,"my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before..."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,37,She remains innocent.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,38,I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honour
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,39,of joining our houses.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,40,"Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,41,"With all my heart, Your Grace."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,42,I have come to love you from afar.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,43,Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,44,And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,45,"I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,46,"but the tales do not do you justice, my lady."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,47,"It would be an honour to return your love,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,48,but I am promised to another.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,49,A king must keep his word.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,50,"Your Grace,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,51,"in the judgement of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,52,"for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,53,a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,54,"For the good of the realm, your councillors beg you"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,55,to set Sansa Stark aside.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,56,- Margaery! - We want Margaery!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,57,"I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,58,but I took a holy vow.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,59,"Your Grace,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,60,"the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,61,"but your father, blessed be his memory,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,62,made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,63,I have consulted with the High Septon
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,64,and he assures me that their crimes against the realm
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,65,free you from any promise you have made to them
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,66,in the sight of the gods.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,67,The gods are good.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,68,I am free to heed my heart.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,69,"Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,70,You will be my queen
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,71,and I will love you from this day until my last day.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,72,My lady.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,73,My sincerest condolences.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,74,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,75,You shouldn't say that.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,76,You'll be good enough for many things.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,77,He'll still enjoy beating you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,78,"And now that you're a woman,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,79,he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,80,"But, if he's not marrying me..."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,81,He'll let you go home?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,82,Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,83,"You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,84,I can see so much of her in you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,85,She was like a sister to me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,86,"For her sake, I'll help get you home."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,87,King's Landing is my home now.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,88,Look around you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,89,We're all liars here.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,90,And every one of us is better than you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,91,Come in.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,92,Make yourself comfortable.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,93,That doesn't look very comfortable.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,94,"Here, watch me."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,95,"- No need for that, my dear. - You sure?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,96,Most men like what they see.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,97,I'm not like most men.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,98,That's what most men say.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,99,"If you don't want what most men want,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,100,then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,101,I would like you
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,102,to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,103,Have we met?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,104,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,105,I meet a lot of men.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,106,And I think you remember all of them.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,107,I think your true talents are wasted on them.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,108,"You're very kind, my lord."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,109,Allow me to return the favour.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,110,You're afraid.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,111,Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,112,I know who you are.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,113,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,114,I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,115,How do you know about that?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,116,I thought you said you knew who I was.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,117,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,118,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,119,I see a potential partner.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,120,"- I'm afraid of him. - Oh, you should be."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,121,He's a dangerous man.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,122,But everyone has their weaknesses.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,123,"Your current employer hides his very well,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,124,but not as well as he thinks.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,125,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,126,Walk.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,127,Childhood must have been awful for you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,128,Were you a foot taller than all the boys?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,129,"They laughed at you, called you names?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,130,Some boys like a challenge.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,131,One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,132,One or two tried.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,133,Ah.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,134,But you fought them off.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,135,But maybe you wished one of them could
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,136,"overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,137,But none of them were strong enough.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,138,- I'm strong enough. - Not interested.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,139,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,140,Ah.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,141,"""They lay with lions."""
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,142,"Tavern girls, I'd say."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,143,Probably served my father's soldiers.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,144,Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,145,That's how they earned this.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,146,The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,147,Must make you proud to serve the Starks.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,148,I don't serve the Starks.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,149,I serve Lady Catelyn.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,150,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,151,- What are you doing? - Burying them.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,152,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,153,I think these women would understand if...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,154,I don't care what you think.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,155,I didn't leave it here. I had me dagger.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,156,Untie me. Now!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,157,"I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,158,"So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,159,it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,160,What's your business here?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,161,Travelling a prisoner.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,162,- You're a woman. - A woman!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,163,"Well, fuck me!"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,164,If you've quite finished up...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,165,"- All right, we'll be going. - Whoa. Whoa!"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,166,Who do you fight for?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,167,The Starks.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,168,What did he do?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,169,"- Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew? - No, stealing is a crime."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,170,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,171,- Where are you taking him? - To Riverrun.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,172,Why Riverrun?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,173,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,174,- Why not kill him? - For stealing a pig?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,175,I don't give the orders.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,176,He must be important to someone.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,177,Sending him with you? How important could he be?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,178,"All right, have it your way,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,179,my lady.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,180,- Do I know you? - Have you been to Ashemark?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,181,- No. - Then you don't know me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,182,Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,183,- Is it near Ashemark? - No.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,184,I've never been there.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,185,What do you think of these beauties?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,186,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,187,"Two of them we did, yeah."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,188,Wait.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,189,I do know you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,190,That's Jaime Lannister.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,191,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,192,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,193,How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,194,I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,195,They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,196,He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,197,"If he was, I'd only be travelling his head."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,198,I have a question for you both.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,199,And I want you to answer it at the same time.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,200,"I count to three, you both answer."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,201,What's his name?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,202,One.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,203,Two. Three.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,204,Two quick deaths.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,205,Those were Stark men.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,206,I don't serve the Starks.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,207,I serve Lady Catelyn.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,208,"I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,209,Stay.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,210,Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,211,I know that.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,212,And you mean to do it anyway?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,213,I love her.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,214,I know that seems important to you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,215,It is important to me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,216,Your father didn't love me when we married.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,217,He hardly knew me or I him.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,218,Love didn't just happen to us.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,219,"We built it slowly over the years,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,220,"stone by stone,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,221,"for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,222,"It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,223,but it is stronger.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,224,It lasts longer.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,225,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,226,- what you and father had? - Why not?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,227,Because she's not beautiful?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,228,Because she's not exotic and exciting?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,229,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,230,And you agreed to it.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,231,You gave him your word.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,232,"Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,233,If your father lived his life for one thing...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,234,My father is dead.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,235,And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,236,You said you saw my victory in the flames.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,237,I did.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,238,- I still see it. - The flames lied.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,239,And I'm no better than a savage
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,240,trusting in a fire god.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,241,I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,242,I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,243,"as their brothers burned alive, and for what?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,244,Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,245,"If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,246,The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,247,You claimed to speak for a god.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,248,Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,249,You talk about war as if you understand it.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,250,I've been fighting far longer than you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,251,Have you?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,252,Show me how you fight.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,253,Show me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,254,Where's your god now?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,255,Will he save you?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,256,Where is your god?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,257,Inside you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,258,I murdered my brother.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,259,We murdered him.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,260,Share the weight with me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,261,He wasn't your brother.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,262,This war has just begun.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,263,It will last for years.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,264,Thousands will die at your command.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,265,You will betray the men serving you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,266,You will betray your family.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,267,You will betray everything you once held dear.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,268,And it will all be worth it
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,269,because you are the Son of Fire.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,270,You are the Warrior of Light.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,271,You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,272,You will be king.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,273,"You promise these things,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,274,but you don't know.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,275,None of us know.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,276,Let me show you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,277,"Look into the fire, my king."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,278,Look.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,279,- I see fire. - Keep looking.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,280,Do you see?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,281,"Do you see, my king?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,282,Yes.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,283,I will kill that man.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,284,"I don't care how many arrows they feather me with,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,285,"how many spears they run through me,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,286,I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,287,They want you to know you're surrounded.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,288,I know I'm surrounded.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,289,I know that because I stood on the battlements
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,290,and saw I was surrounded.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,291,They don't want you to sleep.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,292,They want to sap your spirit before...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,293,"Thank you, wise bald man."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,294,Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,295,No word from my father?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,296,No.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,297,Send more ravens.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,298,You killed all the ravens.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,299,The first time I saw Winterfell...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,300,"First time I saw Winterfell,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,301,it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,302,and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,303,"I saw it and I thought,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,304,"""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,305,"""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,306,Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,307,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,308,Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,309,You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,310,To be told how much you owe them?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,311,And then to go back home to your real father...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,312,I will kill that man.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,313,"I swear to the Drowned God,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,314,"the Old Gods, the New Gods,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,315,"to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,316,"Theon, listen to me."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,317,I serve Winterfell.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,318,Now Winterfell is yours.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,319,I'm bound by oath to serve you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,320,"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,321,Run.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,322,Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,323,You can't win.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,324,Wait for nightfall and run.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,325,There's nowhere to run.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,326,I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,327,"And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,328,I'd be a coward.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,329,The Greyjoy who ran.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,330,The shame of the family.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,331,Don't go home.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,332,Join the Night's Watch.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,333,"Once a man has taken the black,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,334,he's beyond reach of the law.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,335,All his past crimes are forgiven.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,336,I won't make it to the Wall.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,337,I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,338,There are ways.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,339,Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,340,The road will be dangerous.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,341,But with a little luck...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,342,"The Night's Watch is an ancient, honourable order."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,343,You'll have opportunities there.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,344,The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,345,The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,346,"I've done a lot, haven't I?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,347,Things I never imagined myself doing.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,348,"I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,349,You're not the man you're pretending to be.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,350,Not yet.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,351,You may be right.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,352,But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,353,You hear that?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,354,That's the mating call of the Northmen.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,355,They want to fuck us.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,356,"Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,357,They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,358,Aye!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,359,- You think they're right? - Aye.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,360,"We die today, brothers."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,361,We die bleeding from 100 wounds
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,362,"with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,363,but our war cries will echo through eternity.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,364,They will sing about the battle of Winterfell
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,365,until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,366,"Every man, woman and child will know who we were"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,367,and how long we stood.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,368,"Aggar and Gelmarr,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,369,"Wex and Urzen,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,370,Stygg and Black Lorren.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,371,Ironborn warriors will cry out our names
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,372,as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,373,Aye!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,374,- Mothers will name their sons for us. - Aye!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,375,Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,376,Aye!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,377,And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,378,Aye!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,379,- What is dead may never die! - What is dead may never die!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,380,Thought he'd never shut up.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,381,It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,382,What is this?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,383,What are you doing?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,384,Let's go home.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,385,Come on.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,386,Why should I believe you?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,387,Why would I lie about it?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,388,To create strife between my sister and me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,389,Where before there was nothing but love.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,390,Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,391,"If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,392,"- Pod. - Yes, my lord?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,393,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,394,"- No, my lord. - You're a good lad."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,395,"Get Bronn, tell him"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,396,I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,397,I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,398,The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,399,It varies from cloak to cloak.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,400,- Then my hill tribesmen. - Have gone home.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,401,Your father paid them quite handsomely.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,402,"I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,403,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,404,And I thought we were friends.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,405,We are.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,406,"Podrick, would you mind?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,407,There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,408,"The king won't give you any honours,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,409,"the histories won't mention you,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,410,but we will not forget.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,411,"Come along now, Podrick."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,412,My love.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,413,It was good of you to come.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,414,Good of me? Of course I come.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,415,"- I want to see you. - Believe me, you don't."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,416,Have you looked?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,417,I will be the first.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,418,Well?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,419,You are a mess.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,420,I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,421,- You should charge me double. - You think I'm here for money?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,422,That was the arrangement we made.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,423,I pay you and you lie to me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,424,Oh.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,425,"I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,426,so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,427,Fuck your money.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,428,- Let's leave. - Leave?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,429,Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,430,"Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,431,Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,432,- You don't belong here. - What would we do in Pentos?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,433,"Eat, drink,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,434,"fuck, live."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,435,I want to go with you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,436,So do it.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,437,"Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,438,Forget about them. Come with me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,439,I can't.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,440,I do belong here.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,441,These bad people are what I'm good at.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,442,"Outtalking them, outthinking them."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,443,It's what I am.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,444,And I like it.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,445,I like it more than anything I've ever done.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,446,Are you going to leave?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,447,You have a shit memory.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,448,I am yours and you are mine.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,449,"In the sight of the Seven,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,450,"I hereby seal these two souls,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,451,binding them as one for eternity.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,452,Look upon one another
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,453,and say the words.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,454,"- Father, smith... - Father, smith..."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,455,"- warrior, mother... - warrior, mother..."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,456,"- maiden, crone, stranger. - maiden, crone, stranger."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,457,- I am hers and she is mine... - I am his and he is mine...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,458,- from this day until the end of my days. - from this day until the end of my days.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,459,"A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. It is known."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,460,Where are the guards?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,461,"No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,462,Let them try.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,463,Is this a riddle?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,464,Khaleesi!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,465,Khaleesi!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,466,Khaleesi!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,467,Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,468,You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,469,How did he find us?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,470,- What are you doing here? - Waiting for you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,471,How did you know we'd come this way?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,472,"After all the things you have seen, this is your question?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,473,How did you kill those guards?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,474,Was it hard?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,475,"No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,476,Show me how.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,477,"- I want to be able to do it, too. - If you would learn, you must come with me."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,478,Where?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,479,Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,480,My dancing master was from Braavos.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,481,"To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,482,that is something else entirely.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,483,The girl has many names on her lips.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,484,"Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,485,"Ilyn Payne, the Hound."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,486,Names to offer up to the Red God.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,487,She could offer them all one by one.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,488,I want to.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,489,But I can't.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,490,I need to find my brother and mother.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,491,And my sister.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,492,"I need to find her, too."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,493,Then we must part.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,494,A man has duties as well.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,495,- Here. - What is it?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,496,A coin of great value.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,497,Could it buy a horse?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,498,It is not meant for the buying of horses.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,499,Then what good is it?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,500,"If the day comes when you must find me again,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,501,"just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,502,"""Valar Morghulis."""
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,503,Valar Morghulis.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,504,"Please don't go, Jaqen."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,505,Jaqen is dead.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,506,Say it again. Valar Morghulis.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,507,Valar Morghulis.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,508,Good.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,509,"Farewell, Arya Stark."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,510,"Osha, what are you doing?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,511,Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,512,- We'll make you better. - I feel just fine.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,513,They burned it down. They burned everything.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,514,Not everything. Not you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,515,But they may come back. You have to go.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,516,Put on your warmest clothes.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,517,Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,518,North's the wrong way.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,519,And Mother and brother are south.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,520,We don't know where.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,521,There are too many enemies in the south.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,522,"Go to the Wall, to Jon."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,523,He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,524,I don't want to leave you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,525,No more than I want to leave you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,526,I pulled you into the world.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,527,Both of you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,528,I've seen both your faces almost every day since.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,529,"And for that, I consider myself very,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,530,very lucky.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,531,Go now with Hodor. Go on.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,532,I'll be right here.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,533,Osha.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,534,You must protect them.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,535,You're the only one who can.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,536,You may have to protect them against your own kind.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,537,I've got no great love for my own kind.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,538,I'll get you milk of the poppy.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,539,- Tell me where to find it. - I don't want milk of the poppy.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,540,Do it quickly.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,541,Moon of my life.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,542,"This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,543,Took you from me before I could even...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,544,Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,545,Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,546,Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,547,Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,548,That sounds like something you would do.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,549,"Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream..."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,550,...I do not know.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,551,These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,552,You are the moon of my life.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,553,That is all I know...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,554,...and all I need to know.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,555,And if this is a dream...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,556,...I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,557,"Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,558,until the rivers run dry
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,559,and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,560,They miss their mother.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,561,They want to be with you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,562,Do you want to be with them?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,563,You will be.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,564,"When your dragons were born, our magic was born again."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,565,It is strongest in their presence.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,566,And they are strongest in yours.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,567,"You will be with them,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,568,"through winter, summer,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,569,winter again.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,570,"Across a thousand, thousand seasons"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,571,you will be with them.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,572,And we will be with you until time comes to an end.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,573,"Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,574,This is not my home.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,575,"My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,576,They will be waiting a long time.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,577,Dracarys.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,578,We should be there by sundown.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,579,Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,580,"If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,581,Not talking's not the way to go.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,582,Careful with that.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,583,You might cut yourself.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,584,"Never swung a sword before, have you?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,585,You look like a baby with a rattle.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,586,Enough of that!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,587,"- Stop! - Why, traitor?"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,588,So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,589,Let 'em fight.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,590,That's it? That's what you can do?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,591,You little shit.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,592,Your traitor father teach you that?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,593,Or was it your whore mother?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,594,We are the watchers on the Wall.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,595,You can tell Mance
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,596,that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,597,- Burn the body. - Aye.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,598,You don't want this one coming back for you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,599,"Come along, Jon Snow."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,600,Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,601,What the...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,602,"Khaleesi, please."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,603,He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,604,Come.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,605,Nothing.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,606,"Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,607,Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,608,"I am king of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,609,We can take the Iron Throne.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,610,"- I'll bring you a thousand ships. - Please, Khaleesi, I beg you."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,611,All that you have dreamed is within your reach!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,612,"I beg you, please!"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,613,- Khaleesi. - Please! Please!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,614,Khaleesi!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,615,It's all a lie.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,616,Looks real enough to me.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,617,Real enough to buy a ship?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,618,"Aye, a small ship."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,619,Take all the gold and jewels.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,620,I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,621,Is this goat?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,622,It's moose.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,623,People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,624,"Well, you see a tree, let me know."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,625,"If you step back and think about it,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,626,the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is...
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,627,"- Just bloody kill me. - No, truly."
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,628,"The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her,"
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,629,she's still got hope that life might get better.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,630,The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,631,is that she said six words to you.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,632,And the thing about you that I find so interesting
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,633,is absolutely nothing.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,634,It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,635,Two blasts is wildlings.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,636,You're not fighting them alone. Come on.
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,637,Three blasts?
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,638,Run!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,639,Wait! Wait for me!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,640,Grenn!
S02E10,Valar Morghulis,641,Edd!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,1,Fall back!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,2,Brother?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,3,Did you send the ravens?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,4,"Tarly, look at me."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,5,Did you send the ravens?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,6,That was your job.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,7,Your only job.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,8,We need to get back to the Wall.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,9,It's a long march.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,10,"We know what's out there,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,11,"but we have to make it, have to warn them"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,12,"or before winter's done,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,13,everyone you've ever known will be dead.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,14,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,15,"Well, don't stare too long. They're shy."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,16,"When they stop being shy, they get angry."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,17,"And when they're angry,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,18,I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,19,like a hammer on a nail.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,20,- Crow! - Crow!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,21,Look over there!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,22,Crow!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,23,Crow! Look over here! Look!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,24,"Look, crow coming!"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,25,Crow!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,26,You're wearing the wrong colour.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,27,Mance was a ranger.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,28,"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,29,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,30,- Crow! - Crow!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,31,"Sure, you will."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,32,And I'll be free to kill you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,33,"Got no respect, this lot."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,34,Got no fathers to slap them when they're foul.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,35,What happened to their fathers?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,36,Some of them were killed by crows like you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,37,"Don't look so grim, Jon Snow."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,38,"If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,39,And if he don't...
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,40,I smell a crow.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,41,We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,42,What do we want with a baby crow?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,43,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,44,He wants to be one of us.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,45,That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,46,Friends twice your size.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,47,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,48,if you put a sword through their hearts.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,49,Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,50,And there's plenty of little skeletons
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,51,buried in the woods.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,52,"What's your name, boy?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,53,Jon Snow.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,54,Your Grace.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,55,Your Grace?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,56,Did you hear that?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,57,"From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,58,"Stand, boy."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,59,We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,60,"So, you're Ned Stark's bastard."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,61,"Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,62,The girl likes you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,63,"You like her back, Snow?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,64,That why you want to join us?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,65,"Don't panic, boy."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,66,This isn't the damned Night's Watch
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,67,where we make you swear off girls.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,68,This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,69,Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,70,He was our enemy
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,71,and I'm glad he's dead.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,72,He was my brother once.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,73,Back when he had a whole hand.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,74,What were you doing with him?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,75,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,76,Why?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,77,He wants me to lead one day.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,78,"But here you are, a traitor,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,79,kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,80,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,81,"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,82,I want to be free.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,83,"No, I don't think so."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,84,I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,85,"I'll ask you one last time,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,86,why do you want to join us?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,87,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,88,I saw...
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,89,You saw what?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,90,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,91,I saw what took it.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,92,You're telling me you saw one of them?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,93,And why would that make you desert your brothers?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,94,"Because when I told the Lord Commander,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,95,he already knew.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,96,"Thousands of years ago, the First Men defeated the White Walkers."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,97,I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,98,Did I come to the right place?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,99,We'll need to find you a new cloak.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,100,What if you took off that bit there?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,101,Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,102,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,103,I want you to take it off.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,104,Mouth.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,105,Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,106,I didn't hear that.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,107,"- Apologies, ser. - Back away."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,108,Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,109,Then back away some more.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,110,Lord Tyrion sent me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,111,"I will murder you, boy."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,112,He said it was a matter of life and death.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,113,Pod?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,114,It's your sister.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,115,The queen.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,116,What are they doing here?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,117,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,118,"No, I don't think so."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,119,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,120,They stay outside.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,121,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,122,Why are you here?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,123,I wanted to see your face.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,124,"They said you'd lost your nose,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,125,but it's not as gruesome as all that.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,126,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,127,I should hope so.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,128,"The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,129,Thanks to Father.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,130,Thanks to Father.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,131,"Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,132,No? Curious.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,133,Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,134,But then I don't suppose you need much room.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,135,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,136,You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,137,You're meeting Father today?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,138,How do you know that?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,139,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,140,The Master of Whisperers owes me a favour or two.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,141,Father told me. What do you want from him?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,142,What do I want from him? He's my father.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,143,Do I need to want something?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,144,"I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,145,Yet he hasn't come to visit once...
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,146,- Hmm. ...since arriving in King's Landing.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,147,"I lay here, my face split in half,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,148,but Father never came.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,149,You're going to make me cry.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,150,Why do you care what I want from him?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,151,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,152,Slandered? When?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,153,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,154,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,155,"I was nine, too."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,156,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,157,"If I remember correctly,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,158,she never stole a necklace again.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,159,It's not slander if it's true.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,160,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,161,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,162,Because you're a liar.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,163,"I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,164,Any lies in particular?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,165,"You're a clever man,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,166,but not as clever as you think you are.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,167,Mmm. Still makes me more clever than you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,168,Ah.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,169,Look at these two shining warriors.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,170,Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,171,Ser Meryn Trant.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,172,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,173,- You're no knight. - Pod.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,174,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,175,"You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,176,That's exactly who I am.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,177,And you're a grub in fancy armour
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,178,who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,179,"Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,180,"You put your hand on that door,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,181,you lose the hand.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,182,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,183,I am wondering why you sent for me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,184,Many people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,185,I've been doing that for a while now.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,186,Do you grow bored protecting me?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,187,I grow poor protecting you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,188,Poor? Poor?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,189,"Under my patronage you've become a knight,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,190,you've served as Commander of the City Watch.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,191,Briefly.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,192,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,193,And now my pockets are empty.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,194,You've given me a taste for the finer things.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,195,"And if you want me protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,196,I thought we were friends.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,197,We are.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,198,But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,199,I don't loan it out to friends as a favour.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,200,- How much? - Double.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,201,Double?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,202,I'm a knight now.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,203,Knights are worth double.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,204,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,205,Which means you can afford it.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,206,Here. Here!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,207,Help me!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,208,Who are you?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,209,I was in the battle at Blackwater.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,210,I was a captain and a knight.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,211,"Aye, ser, and serving which king?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,212,"The one true king of Westeros,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,213,Stannis Baratheon.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,214,I thought you were dead.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,215,Everyone thought you were dead.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,216,And your son?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,217,He may have swam ashore as you did.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,218,"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,219,"I'm so sorry, my friend."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,220,"I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,221,"But, Davos, you were a good father."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,222,"If I was a good father, he'd still be here."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,223,Stannis lives?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,224,He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,225,Will you take me there?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,226,There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,227,This war is not over.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,228,"Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,229,We're both sworn to King Stannis.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,230,I am sworn to no man.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,231,I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,232,I delivered the ships.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,233,Stannis never gives up. Never.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,234,Now he will regroup...
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,235,He's a broken man.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,236,His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,237,"They say he sees no one, not his generals, not even his wife."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,238,"Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,239,and burning men alive.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,240,What?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,241,They built a great fire when Stannis returned.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,242,All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,243,They say she sang to them as they burned.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,244,I'm a pirate.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,245,You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,246,I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,247,"Take me back there, please."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,248,You cannot turn Stannis against her.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,249,"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,250,You could try.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,251,"If you fail, they will burn you."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,252,"If you succeed, they'll burn you."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,253,And you've only just come back to life.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,254,"Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,255,You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,256,"And you drank with me on four of mine,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,257,but I don't ask you for favours.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,258,"I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,259,"When you are dead,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,260,I will gather your bones in a little sack
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,261,and let your widow wear them around her neck.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,262,"We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,263,There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,264,The Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,265,The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,266,I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,267,I don't think we're going to get one.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,268,Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,269,"The debt will be repaid, my friend."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,270,For them and for your sons.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,271,Will it?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,272,They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,273,The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,274,My best hunters are after him.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,275,A Mallister?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,276,Ser Jeremy.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,277,My father's bannerman.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,278,Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,279,She's your mother.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,280,She freed Jaime Lannister.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,281,The Lannisters robbed them of their sons
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,282,and she robbed them of their justice.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,283,Water.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,284,Water.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,285,This needs to be cleaned and closed.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,286,"What's your name, friend?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,287,Qyburn.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,288,You're lucky to be alive.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,289,Lucky?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,290,The badge looks good on you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,291,Almost as good as it looked on me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,292,Are you enjoying your new position?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,293,Am I enjoying it?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,294,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,295,Yes. I heard how happy you were.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,296,You brought a whore into my bed.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,297,It wasn't your bed at the time.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,298,I sent you here to advise the king.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,299,I gave you real power and authority.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,300,You chose to spend your days
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,301,"as you always have,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,302,bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,303,Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,304,"What do you want, Tyrion?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,305,Why does everyone assume I want something?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,306,Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,307,My beloved father who
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,308,somehow forgot to visit his wounded son
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,309,after he fell on the battlefield.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,310,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,311,I organised the defence of this city
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,312,while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,313,I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,314,"while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,315,I bled in the mud for our family.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,316,"And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,317,But what do I want?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,318,A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,319,Jugglers and singers require applause.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,320,You are a Lannister.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,321,Do you think I demanded a garland of roses
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,322,every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,323,Hmm?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,324,"Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,325,and three of them are in open rebellion.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,326,So tell me what you want.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,327,I want what is mine by right.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,328,"Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,329,"But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,330,"The day Jaime put on the white cloak,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,331,he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,332,I am your son and lawful heir.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,333,You want Casterly Rock?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,334,It is mine by right.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,335,We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,336,and as a reward for your accomplishments
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,337,during the battle of Blackwater Bay.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,338,"And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,339,so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,340,"And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,341,And I would let myself be consumed by maggots
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,342,before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,343,Why?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,344,Why?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,345,You ask that?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,346,"You, who killed your mother to come into the world?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,347,"You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,348,"full of envy, lust, and low cunning."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,349,Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colours
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,350,since I cannot prove that you are not mine.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,351,"And to teach me humility, the Gods have condemned me"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,352,to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,353,that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,354,But neither Gods nor men
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,355,will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,356,into your whorehouse.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,357,"Go, now."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,358,Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,359,Go.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,360,One more thing.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,361,The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,362,Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,363,Why Dorne?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,364,It's carrying silk
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,365,and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,366,But it's not coming back.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,367,The captain's tired of risking his life
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,368,so King's Landing lords and ladies
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,369,can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,370,He's going to stay in Dorne.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,371,Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,372,I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,373,Don't ruin the game.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,374,"I told you, I don't want to play."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,375,What about that one there?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,376,That one? It's going to Volantis.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,377,Why?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,378,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,379,That's not how the game works.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,380,You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,381,You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,382,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,383,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,384,Lovely day for it.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,385,Watching the ships.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,386,Lord Baelish.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,387,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,388,I saw your mother not long ago.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,389,She's very eager to see you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,390,And your sister.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,391,Arya's alive?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,392,You said you'd take me home.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,393,You said King's Landing was your home.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,394,You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,395,If you were to tell just one person...
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,396,I won't tell anyone.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,397,How do I know?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,398,Because I'm a terrible liar.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,399,You said so yourself.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,400,"Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,401,I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,402,"When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,403,But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,404,You're her handmaiden?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,405,Yes. And you're his...
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,406,I help manage his affairs.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,407,He's an important person.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,408,So is she.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,409,I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,410,"The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,411,"We've both done rather well, you and I."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,412,Yes.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,413,Given where we started.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,414,And where is that?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,415,It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,416,Watch out for her.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,417,I always do.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,418,Watch out for her with him.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,419,They're growing fast.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,420,Not fast enough.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,421,I can't wait that long.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,422,I need an army.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,423,We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,424,Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,425,The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,426,The distinction means a good deal to some people.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,427,Do those people have any better ideas
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,428,about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,429,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,430,You're right.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,431,Another lovely day on the high seas.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,432,Don't mock them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,433,They're the first Dothraki on a ship.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,434,They followed me across the poison water.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,435,"If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar..."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,436,"The Dothraki follow strength above all, Khaleesi."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,437,You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,438,And not before.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,439,Your Grace.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,440,I heard you were dead.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,441,Not yet.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,442,"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,443,We are alone.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,444,"Your Grace, you are the rightful king."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,445,Not only by blood.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,446,"You're an honourable man, a just man."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,447,And there is still a war to fight.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,448,I am fighting.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,449,By burning prisoners alive?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,450,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,451,I do not judge people for the Gods they worship.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,452,"If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,453,before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,454,I'm not your enemy.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,455,You are my enemy.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,456,Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,457,Did I set your ships ablaze?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,458,I wasn't there when the wildfire
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,459,killed our men by the thousands.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,460,I could have saved those men.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,461,"You would have taken the city, Stannis would sit upon his rightful throne,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,462,and you would stand beside him.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,463,But I wasn't there
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,464,because you convinced your king to leave me behind.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,465,Do you hear them screaming?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,466,"All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,467,for their Gods for help?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,468,Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,469,"Don't despair, Ser Davos."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,470,What I told your son is true.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,471,Death by fire is the purest death.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,472,This woman is evil!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,473,She's the mother of demons.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,474,Take him and lock him in a cell.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,475,- Your Grace! - Come on.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,476,"You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,477,She will destroy us all!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,478,I will pray for you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,479,Your Grace!
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,480,Halt. Down.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,481,Halt. Down.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,482,Why have we stopped?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,483,"It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,484,What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,485,"My lady. We should have guards, my lady."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,486,Why?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,487,Pardon me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,488,"Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,489,I have others.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,490,"Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,491,No.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,492,He was a soldier.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,493,He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,494,He never came back.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,495,And your mother?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,496,She died when she had me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,497,"Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,498,but your father stopped them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,499,"Whenever you look at this knight,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,500,I want you to remember your father.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,501,He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,502,And what do knights swear to do?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,503,Protect the weak and uphold the good.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,504,Your father did that. Be proud of him.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,505,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,506,"You should be proud, too."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,507,"Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,508,They saved us all.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,509,"From now on, we're going to take care of you."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,510,All of you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,511,"Come to me for what you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,512,Directly to me.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,513,- Your Grace. - Your Grace.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,514,"Please, sit. Sit."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,515,"I do apologise, my lady."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,516,Small Council meetings.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,517,At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,518,"That's a lovely gown, my lady."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,519,"Yes, it suits you perfectly."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,520,I imagine you might be rather cold.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,521,The climate is a bit more forgiving
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,522,"back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,523,"Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,524,"I am touched by your concern, Your Grace."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,525,"Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,526,"Doesn't it, Loras?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,527,Yes.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,528,"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,529,"The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,530,I've never seen anything like it.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,531,You might find a bit of armour quite useful
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,532,once you become queen. Perhaps before.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,533,Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,534,on your way back from the sept this morning.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,535,Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,536,Margaery does a great deal of work
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,537,with the poor back in Highgarden.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,538,The lowest among us are no different from the highest
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,539,if you give them a chance
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,540,and approach them with an open heart.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,541,An open heart is what you'll get
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,542,"if you're not careful, my dear."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,543,"Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,544,We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,545,The king barely escaped with his life.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,546,My mother's always had a penchant for drama.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,547,Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,548,Our lives were never truly in danger.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,549,"You're right, of course."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,550,But you are your father's son.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,551,We can't all have a king's bravery.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,552,Hunger turns men into beasts.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,553,I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,554,They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,555,"Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,556,And it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,557,"Well, as Ser Loras said,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,558,Lady Margaery has done this sort
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,559,"of, uh, charitable work before."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,560,I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,561,I'm sure she does.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,562,The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,563,They will stand until they drop.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,564,Such is their obedience.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,565,They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,566,"The Westerosi woman is pleased with them,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,567,but speaks no praise to keep the price down.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,568,She wishes to know how they are trained.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,569,Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,570,The day is hot.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,571,They begin their training at 5.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,572,Every day they drill from dawn to dusk
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,573,"until they have mastered the shortsword,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,574,"the shield, and the three spears."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,575,Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,576,Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,577,They fear nothing.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,578,Even the bravest men fear death.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,579,The knight says even brave men fear death.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,580,Tell the old man he smells of piss.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,581,"Truly, Master?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,582,"No, not truly."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,583,Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,584,My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,585,Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,586,to open her eyes and watch.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,587,"He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,588,Tell the good master there is no need.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,589,She's worried about their nipples?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,590,Does the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,591,My master points out that men don't need nipples.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,592,"Here, I'm done with you."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,593,This one is pleased to have served you.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,594,"To win his shield,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,595,"an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,596,find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,597,"This way, my master says, we make certain"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,598,there is no weakness left in them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,599,"You take a babe from its mother's arms,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,600,"kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,601,She is offended.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,602,"She asks if you pay a silver coin to the mother,"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,603,for her dead baby.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,604,What a soft mewling fool this one is.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,605,My master would like you to know that the silver is paid
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,606,"to the baby's owner, not the mother."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,607,How many do you have to sell?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,608,Eight thousand.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,609,Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,610,Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,611,Many other buyers are interested.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,612,Eight thousand dead babies.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,613,The Unsullied are a means to an end.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,614,"Once I own them, these men..."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,615,They're not men. Not any more.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,616,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,617,You think these slaves will have better lives
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,618,serving men like Kraznys or serving you?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,619,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,620,You won't order them to murder babies.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,621,You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,622,A great injustice has been done to them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,623,Closing your eyes will not undo it.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,624,The warlocks.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,625,"I owe you my life, ser."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,626,"The honour is mine, my queen."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,627,You know this man?
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,628,I know him
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,629,as one of the greatest fighters
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,630,the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,631,and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,632,King Robert is dead.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,633,"I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,634,I was sworn to protect your family.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,635,I failed them.
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,636,"I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father."
S03E01,Valar Dohaeris,637,Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",1,"Don't think too much, Bran."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",2,Relax your bow arm.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",3,And which one of you was a marksman at 10?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",4,Father?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",5,"You can't kill it, you know."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",6,Why not?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",7,Because the raven is you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",8,Hodor.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",9,"It's all right, Hodor."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",10,Hodor.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",11,"Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",12,"No, it was the three-eyed raven."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",13,He's back.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",14,"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",15,- There was a boy. - I don't want to hear about it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",16,- But you asked. - We've got plenty of worries.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",17,We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",18,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",19,"I know you didn't, little lord."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",20,We need to move. We don't know who might be after us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",21,No one knows we're alive.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",22,And who told you that?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",23,The three-eyed raven tell you?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",24,"- No. - Some good he is, then."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",25,I don't know what people know and don't.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",26,I only know the Wall is a long way off.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",27,My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",28,"Grim, bearded,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",29,stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",30,and steal us from our beds.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",31,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",32,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",33,Never?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",34,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",35,"Pardon me, Your Grace."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",36,My queen.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",37,Lord Bolton.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",38,Let me guess which is the good news.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",39,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",40,I hadn't seen him in years.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",41,I don't even know how many.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",42,We'll travel to the funeral together.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",43,Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",44,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",45,Something else?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",46,"Before Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",47,They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",48,And Bran and Rickon have not been found.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",49,They may have escaped.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",50,Or Theon may have taken them to the Iron Islands as hostages.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",51,Have you received any demands?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",52,No.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",53,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",54,Where am I?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",55,Who are you?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",56,What do you want?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",57,I want to do this.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",58,Do you know how long it'll take to get to King's Landing
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",59,walking through fields and forests?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",60,Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",61,How shall we pass the time?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",62,By putting one foot in front of the other.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",63,It's going to be a very dull walk.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",64,I'm here to take you to King's Landing
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",65,and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",66,Dull is fine.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",67,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",68,no one enjoys the company of a humourless mute.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",69,Trust me on this.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",70,People have been serving me since I was born.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",71,You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",72,following her around for the rest of her life?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",73,A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",74,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",75,I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",76,For all the good it's done her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",77,How did you come into Lady Stark's service?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",78,There's something we can talk about.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",79,"Not your concern, Kingslayer."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",80,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",81,How would you know?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",82,Because I visited Winterfell.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",83,I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",84,Move.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",85,"- Were you pledged to Stannis? - Gods, no."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",86,"Ah, Renly. Really?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",87,He wasn't fit to rule over anything
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",88,more important than a 12-course meal.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",89,- Shut your mouth. - Why?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",90,"I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",91,Could hardly escape the little tulip.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",92,Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",93,I knew him better than you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",94,I knew him as well as anyone.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",95,"As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",96,He would have been a wonderful king.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",97,Sounds like you quite fancied him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",98,I did not fancy him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",99,"Oh, Gods, you did."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",100,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",101,"You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",102,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",103,You're far too much man for him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",104,I'm not interested in foul rumours.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",105,Unless they're about me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",106,It's all true about Renly.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",107,His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",108,It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",109,They'd have never got him off it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",110,Shut your mouth!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",111,"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",112,We don't get to choose who we love.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",113,"Where are you headed, then?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",114,South.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",115,- You? - Riverrun.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",116,"Staying off the King's Road, are you?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",117,They get you no matter where you go.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",118,You can't win.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",119,"No, you really can't."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",120,Looks like you're safe enough.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",121,"Meaning no offence, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",122,- Seven blessings to you. - And you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",123,He knows who I am.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",124,He doesn't.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",125,Maybe you're right. What if you're not? What if he tells someone?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",126,We're not doing it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",127,He's an innocent man.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",128,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",129,Make it tighter here.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",130,Mmm. That's better.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",131,It makes you look very strong.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",132,No flowers.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",133,I said no flowers.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",134,All these are wrong. Bring others.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",135,"Yes, Your Grace."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",136,Bloody flowers. On the king.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",137,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",138,Should be more than enough fabric.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",139,Tell me what you think of her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",140,Who?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",141,Margaery.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",142,She's an ideal match.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",143,"With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",144,"Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",145,and no one will think of rebelling for another century.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",146,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",147,She's beautiful and intelligent.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",148,"Yes, she is."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",149,Her concern with the well-being
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",150,of the common people is interesting.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",151,Not to me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",152,I only meant to go out of your way to endanger...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",153,This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",154,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",155,She dresses like a harlot for a reason.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",156,Married a traitor and known degenerate
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",157,like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",158,She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",159,That's what intelligent women do. What they're told.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",160,You need to ask yourself...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",161,I don't need to do anything.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",162,Better.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",163,Much better.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",164,I still don't believe it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",165,He didn't want anything.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",166,He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",167,Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",168,Littlefinger's not in love with me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",169,Love is not the thing he wants.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",170,He's too old.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",171,They never see it that way.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",172,He didn't ask you to do something for him?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",173,Spy on someone or...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",174,No.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",175,If he does ask you for anything or try anything
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",176,"or touch you, I want you to tell me."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",177,Why? What will you do?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",178,I will make him stop.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",179,"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",180,Send him in.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",181,Lady Sansa.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",182,Ser Loras.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",183,"My sister invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",184,"the Lady Olenna, in the gardens."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",185,May I escort you to them?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",186,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",187,"You are too kind, Ser Loras."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",188,You probably don't remember the first time we met.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",189,"At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favour."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",190,"A rose, a red rose."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",191,Of course I did.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",192,It's more your colour. You take it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",193,Thank you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",194,You're such a dear.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",195,I'll take my leave.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",196,Lady Sansa.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",197,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",198,Come.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",199,"Lady Sansa, it is my honour to present my grandmother."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",200,The Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",201,"Kiss me, child."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",202,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",203,We're very sorry for your losses.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",204,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",205,- He was very gallant. - Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",206,And charming and very clean.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",207,He knew how to dress and smile and somehow
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",208,this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",209,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",210,Father liked him and so did Loras.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",211,Loras is young and good at knocking men off horses with a stick.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",212,That does not make him wise.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",213,As to your fathead father...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",214,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",215,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",216,It was treason. I warned them.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",217,Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",218,How can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",219,We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",220,"But once the cow's been milked, there's no"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",221,squirting the cream back up her udders.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",222,So here we are to see things through.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",223,"What do you say to that, Sansa?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",224,Shall we have some lemon cakes?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",225,Lemon cake's my favourite.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",226,So we've been told.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",227,Are you going to bring the food
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",228,or do you mean to starve us to death?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",229,"Here, Sansa, come sit with me."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",230,I'm much less boring than these others.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",231,Do you know my son?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",232,The Lord of Highgarden?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",233,I haven't had the pleasure.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",234,"Mmm. No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",235,"His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",236,He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",237,They say he was looking up at the sky
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",238,and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",239,"And now my son is doing the same,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",240,only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",241,Now...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",242,I want you to tell me the truth
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",243,"about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",244,I... I...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",245,"You, you. Who else would know better?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",246,We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",247,Has this boy mistreated you? Has he ripped out your tongue?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",248,"King Joffrey, His Grace is very fair and handsome"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",249,and as brave as a lion.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",250,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",251,"And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",252,But how kind is he? How clever?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",253,"Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",254,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",255,Bring me some cheese.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",256,"Cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",257,The cheese will be served when I want it served.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",258,I want it served now.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",259,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",260,We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",261,My father always told the truth.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",262,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",263,Joffrey.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",264,Joffrey did that.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",265,He promised he would be merciful
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",266,and he cut my father's head off.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",267,And he said that was mercy.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",268,Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",269,Go on.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",270,I can't. I never meant...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",271,My father was a traitor.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",272,My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",273,Please don't make me say any more.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",274,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Look at her."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",275,"Speak freely, child."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",276,"We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",277,He's a monster.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",278,Ah.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",279,That's a pity.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",280,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",281,Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",282,is determined that Margaery shall be queen.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",283,"Even so, we thank you for the truth."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",284,Ah.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",285,Here comes my cheese.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",286,We're at war. This march is a distraction.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",287,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",288,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",289,No.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",290,Then it's a distraction.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",291,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",292,We need his men.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",293,"Unless he's been breeding them,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",294,he don't have enough to make a difference.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",295,Have you lost faith in our cause?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",296,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",297,If you no longer believe...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",298,I can believe till it snows in Dorne.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",299,Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",300,You don't think we can win?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",301,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",302,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",303,I think you lost this war the day you married her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",304,Whoa! Whoa!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",305,Your Grace.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",306,You're afraid of her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",307,And she knows it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",308,I'm not afraid of her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",309,"May I help you, Lady Stark?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",310,No.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",311,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have..."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",312,You can't help because a mother
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",313,makes one for her children to protect them.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",314,Only a mother can make them.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",315,You've made them before?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",316,Twice.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",317,Did they work?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",318,After a fashion.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",319,I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",320,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",321,"Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",322,But it would be a very long night.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",323,So I sat with him all through the darkness.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",324,Listened to his ragged little breaths.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",325,"His coughing, his whimpering."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",326,Which boy?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",327,Jon Snow.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",328,"When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",329,I didn't want to see those brown
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",330,stranger's eyes staring up at me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",331,"So I prayed to the Gods, take him away. Make him die."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",332,He got the pox.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",333,And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",334,A murderer.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",335,"I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",336,all because I was jealous of his mother.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",337,A woman he didn't even know.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",338,"So I prayed to all seven Gods,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",339,let the boy live.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",340,Let him live and I'll love him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",341,I'll be a mother to him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",342,"I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",343,"to call him Stark and be done with it,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",344,to make him one of us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",345,And he lived.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",346,And he lived.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",347,And I couldn't keep my promise.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",348,"And everything that's happened since then,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",349,"all this horror that's come to my family,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",350,it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",351,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",352,Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",353,You liked him?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",354,"I like you, but if you're playing us false,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",355,it won't be hard for me to kill you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",356,I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",357,I understand.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",358,"Well, how could you understand?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",359,You want to protect your people.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",360,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",361,half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",362,They speak seven different languages in my army.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",363,The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",364,Everyone hates the cave people.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",365,So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",366,to march together in the same army?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",367,No.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",368,I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",369,Because that's the truth.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",370,Shouldn't be long now.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",371,What's wrong with him?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",372,He's a warg.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",373,"He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",374,He's scouting for us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",375,"What, you've never met a warg?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",376,Orell.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",377,Where were you this time?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",378,The Fist of the First Men.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",379,What did you see?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",380,Dead crows.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",381,"What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",382,There's 200 brothers killed by dead men
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",383,and you're still here
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",384,whimpering.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",385,That seem fair to you?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",386,I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",387,"Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",388,You know you want to.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",389,Hey.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",390,"Get up, Sam."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",391,No.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",392,Get up.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",393,I can't.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",394,"If you stop, you'll die."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",395,"'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",396,You don't care.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",397,'Course we care.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",398,You left me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",399,"When the White Walkers came, you left me."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",400,"Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",401,We didn't want to die.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",402,Help me get him up.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",403,Looks like that piggy is done for.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",404,Help us get him up.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",405,He's slowing us down.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",406,Just get him up!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",407,Why? So the rest of us can die?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",408,We'll move faster without him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",409,"What is this? Get up, Tarly."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",410,Is he all right?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",411,"Aye, I think so."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",412,- We may as well just go without him. - That's enough.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",413,"Tarly, I forbid you to die."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",414,Do you hear me?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",415,Why should the rest of us...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",416,"Rast, you're responsible for him."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",417,What am I supposed to do?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",418,Make sure he gets back alive.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",419,"If he doesn't, you don't."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",420,Move on!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",421,"I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",422,Where's Rickon and Hodor?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",423,Looking for food.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",424,What's out there?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",425,"Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",426,I'm unarmed.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",427,That was poor planning.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",428,My sister carries the weapons.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",429,I'm better with them.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",430,Drop the spear.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",431,Drop it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",432,"If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",433,You must be Summer.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",434,"I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister, Meera."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",435,"We've come a long way to find you, Brandon."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",436,And we have much farther to go.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",437,I'm just trying to understand.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",438,Would you please shut up about it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",439,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",440,I'm not listening.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",441,But just explain it to me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",442,He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",443,All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",444,You could have picked King Joffrey.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",445,Shut up.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",446,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",447,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",448,But you could have ended the war.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",449,Where are we going?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",450,North.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",451,We should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",452,Maybe we passed it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",453,It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",454,"If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",455,My mother grew up there. My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",456,- Could be a minstrel. - Shut up.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",457,A minstrel's got gold sometimes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",458,"We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",459,Shh!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",460,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",461,That lord of Castamere
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",462,But now the rains weep o'er his hall
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",463,With no one there to hear
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",464,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",465,"Just a dirty little cub, I think."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",466,- Loose a few more shafts. - Don't.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",467,"Put the sword down, girl."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",468,You go on down the road. Keep singing so we know where you are.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",469,Leave us be and I won't kill you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",470,Generous.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",471,You're a dangerous person.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",472,I like dangerous people.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",473,Why are your friends so shy?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",474,What friends?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",475,The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",476,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",477,You escape from Harrenhal?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",478,Who are you?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",479,Thoros of Myr.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",480,The fellow with the bow is Anguy.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",481,"No, who do you fight for?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",482,The Brotherhood Without Banners.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",483,Now come along.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",484,I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",485,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",486,That's who the Mountain were looking for.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",487,They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",488,You've got nothing to fear from us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",489,The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",490,We're trying to save it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",491,Now come on. We'll talk more over brown bread and stew.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",492,And then you can go on your way.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",493,"Here's the thing, fat boy."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",494,"When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",495,"So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",496,Half the country's starving and look at this one.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",497,Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",498,My lion.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",499,We've spoken of this.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",500,You cannot come here.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",501,But you said I should come to you with any problems.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",502,Did anyone see you?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",503,- No. - You sure?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",504,My father does not make idle threats.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",505,Having you killed would be the high point of his week.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",506,You have to be absolutely certain.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",507,All right. What is this problem?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",508,I'm worried about Sansa.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",509,"When she spoke with Lord Baelish,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",510,his friend warned me about him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",511,Baelish doesn't have friends.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",512,I don't know her name.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",513,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",514,How do you know her?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",515,I try to know as many people as I can.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",516,You never know which one you'll need.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",517,She's a whore.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",518,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgemental about these things."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",519,You fucked her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",520,"Oh, please."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",521,"All right, yes, I fucked her once."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",522,Twice.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",523,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",524,And was she good? Did you like her?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",525,"Not as much as I like you, obviously,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",526,or she'd be the one torturing me right now.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",527,What did she say about Littlefinger?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",528,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",529,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",530,We have to protect her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",531,We can't.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",532,"Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",533,A great beauty with a very old name.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",534,"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",535,"Yes, she is, objectively, very."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",536,"Her face is quite pleasing, to other men and to women,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",537,people in general.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",538,"But not to me, of course."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",539,I only have eyes for you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",540,You pervert. You want her?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",541,This child?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",542,I don't even want to talk about her.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",543,But you are.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",544,Only because you're making me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",545,I didn't force you to open
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",546,your mouth and make words come out.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",547,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",548,"Aw! ""The cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."""
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",549,Mmm. Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",550,Now do you think I'm cruel?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",551,Only if you stop.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",552,But you mustn't come here again.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",553,Do you hear me?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",554,You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",555,Dangerous people. Mmm.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",556,"Lady Tyrell, my king."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",557,Send her in.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",558,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",559,I'm leaving on a hunting trip.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",560,I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",561,"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",562,I have everything I could want.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",563,Good. Good.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",564,How are you finding life in the capital?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",565,It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",566,A welcome one.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",567,A military encampment is no place for a lady.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",568,And the bedside of a traitor?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",569,Is that a place for a lady?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",570,"Your Grace,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",571,"I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",572,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",573,The duty of any wife to any husband. To provide him with children.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",574,You failed to do this.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",575,- Why? - I...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",576,I would not speak ill of the dead.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",577,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",578,'cause he had a sword put through his heart?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",579,No. I do beg your pardon.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",580,The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",581,Renly...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",582,I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",583,What makes you say this?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",584,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he..."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",585,"He had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",586,He never wanted to try.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",587,"Except one evening,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",588,"after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something..."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",589,Something that sounded very painful
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",590,and couldn't possibly result in children.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",591,Maybe the fault was with me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",592,"No, he was a known degenerate."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",593,"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",594,Mmm.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",595,I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",596,As is your right.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",597,You must do whatever you need to do.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",598,You are the king.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",599,Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",600,I am.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",601,Do you like it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",602,I just had it made. Probably one of
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",603,the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",604,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",605,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",606,You use this lever to draw the string.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",607,The bolt goes here.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",608,And then you just aim...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",609,And...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",610,Would you take me hunting sometime?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",611,"Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",612,It's not unheard of.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",613,My father would never let me before...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",614,You no longer belong to him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",615,Do you want to hold it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",616,May I? Please.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",617,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",618,and watch something die over there.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",619,Could you do it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",620,Could you kill something?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",621,"I don't know, Your Grace. Do you think I could?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",622,Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",623,Would you like to watch me?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",624,Yes.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",625,Stop! Stop!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",626,Tell us the truth.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",627,About what?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",628,I don't know what you want.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",629,I want the truth.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",630,What truth?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",631,Why'd you take Winterfell?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",632,I took it to... I took it...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",633,- Who gave the orders? - No one.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",634,- I took it on my own. - Why?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",635,To take the North while vulnerable.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",636,And once you took it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",637,Hold it. Rule it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",638,Good. That's very good.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",639,Why did you do that? I told you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",640,Why did you take Winterfell?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",641,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",642,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",643,I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",644,What are you doing?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",645,Please.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",646,I'll tell you anything. Just take it off.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",647,"Please. Please, just take it off."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",648,- Your sister sent me. - Yara?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",649,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",650,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",651,"Please, please. Please, please don't go!"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",652,Please. Please. Don't leave me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",653,Please don't go.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",654,"Rickon, stay with us."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",655,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",656,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",657,Only when I'm asleep.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",658,That's how it begins until you learn to control it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",659,You're a warg.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",660,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",661,A three-eyed raven?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",662,You've seen it?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",663,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",664,Does it have anything to do with warging?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",665,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",666,The raven brings the sight.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",667,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",668,Or things that happened long before you were born
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",669,or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",670,What's he telling him?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",671,Why don't you ask?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",672,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",673,Where's the shame in that?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",674,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",675,is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",676,Some people will always need help.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",677,That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",678,"When my father died, I dreamt it."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",679,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",680,"You have the sight, too?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",681,"When I told my father about your father,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",682,"for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",683,Your father is Howland Reed?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",684,Yeah.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",685,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",686,Your father told you about the rebellion?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",687,"Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",688,What else have you seen?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",689,"Only one thing that matters,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",690,you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",691,I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",692,Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",693,I don't drink ale.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",694,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",695,- Yeah! - You see?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",696,They've suffered through my bouts of
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",697,sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",698,"Now, how did three children..."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",699,We're not children.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",700,"How did three young persons such as yourselves,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",701,"untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",702,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armoury.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",703,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",704,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",705,That criminal. He charges twice as much
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",706,as every other armourer in the city.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",707,- That's because he's twice as good. - Ah-ha!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",708,A smith and a salesman.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",709,- Gendry stole us weapons. - Ah!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",710,"Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",711,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",712,My brothers taught me.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",713,Ooh!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",714,To your brothers!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",715,You can finish your meals before you go.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",716,It may be awhile before you see another.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",717,You'll free us?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",718,I gave you my word.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",719,"But before you go,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",720,allow me to raise a cup to your...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",721,"Hey, hey."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",722,Now that is an uncommonly large person.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",723,How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",724,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",725,Poor man. You have my sympathy.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",726,Aha!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",727,Not a man at all.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",728,A Hound!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",729,"So good to see you again, Clegane."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",730,Thoros?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",731,The fuck you doing here?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",732,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",733,"A pretty prize, lads."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",734,Yeah!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",735,Girl.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",736,What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",737,It's a tough decision.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",738,Take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",739,Silence.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",740,"Anyone can see us on the bridge,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",741,but cross by water and the current could take us.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",742,Or I could escape down the river.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",743,Good luck.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",744,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",745,Which will she choose?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",746,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",747,Be quick about it.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",748,"- Oh, I need to rest. - Get up."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",749,"I have these, on your feet when you walk too far."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",750,- What do you call them? - Get up now.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",751,Corns. I never used to get corns.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",752,"I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",753,wearing the same shit boots for over a year.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",754,This heel is ruined. There's no way...
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",755,I never understood why some knights
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",756,felt the need to carry two swords.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",757,Ooh!
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",758,You move well
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",759,for a great beast of a woman.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",760,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",761,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",762,"But if you don't kill me,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",763,I'm going to kill you.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",764,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",765,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",766,"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",767,if you can call that a woman.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",768,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",769,The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",770,You sure he's the one?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",771,"That's him, all right."
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",772,I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",773,Give the man his silver.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",774,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",775,Enough to buy me a new head?
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",776,"If the King in the North hears I let the Kingslayer go,"
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",777,he'll be taking it right off.
S03E02,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",778,I'd rather he takes yours.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,1,"If I may, nephew,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,2,I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,3,at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,4,Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,5,"And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,6,Robb knows I meant him no...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,7,You're lucky I'm not your king.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,8,I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,9,My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,10,back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,11,I think King Robb understands we won't win this war
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,12,if he's the only one winning any battles.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,13,"No, there's glory enough to go around."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,14,It's not about glory.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,15,Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,16,I seized an opportunity.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,17,What value was the mill?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,18,The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,19,Is he there now?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,20,Of course not. We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,21,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,22,"into our country, where we could surround him and kill him."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,23,"I wanted him to chase us,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,24,which he would have done because he is a mad dog
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,25,without a strategic thought in his head.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,26,I could have that head on a spike by now.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,27,"Instead, I have a mill."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,28,We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,29,Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,30,"Martyn is 15, I believe."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,31,Tywin Lannister has my sisters.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,32,Have I sued for peace?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,33,No.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,34,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,35,brother's great-grandsons?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,36,No.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,37,How many men did you lose?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,38,"208. But for every man we lost, the Lannisters..."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,39,We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,40,I'm sorry.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,41,I didn't know.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,42,You would have.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,43,"Right here today at this gathering, if you had been patient."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,44,We seem to be running short of patience here.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,45,You know who isn't?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,46,Tywin Lannister.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,47,Intimate. Lovely table.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,48,Better chairs than the old Small Council chamber.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,49,Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,50,What news of Jaime?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,51,"20,000 unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,52,You control more spies and informants
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,53,than the rest of the world combined.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,54,Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,55,"We are trying, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,56,Try harder.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,57,"What do we have, then?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,58,Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,59,for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,60,"In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,61,"which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,62,"in practice, not in name."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,63,Let him have it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,64,The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,65,The Lord of Harrenhal will make
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,66,a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,67,"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,68,Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,69,She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,70,A successful courtship would make
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,71,Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,72,Titles do seem to breed titles.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,73,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,74,and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,75,Then the young wolf can add his own aunt
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,76,to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,77,"Far be it from me to hinder true love,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,78,but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,79,The royal wedding may end up being
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,80,the most expensive event in living memory.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,81,"Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,82,Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,83,Fully agreed.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,84,Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,85,Master of Coin?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,86,It would appear to best suits your talents.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,87,"I'm quite good at spending money,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,88,but a lifetime of outrageous wealth
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,89,hasn't taught me much about managing it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,90,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,91,"Hear, hear."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,92,He lifted her high in the air
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,93,He sniffed and roared and smelled her there
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,94,"She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,95,But he licked the honey from her hair
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,96,"From there to here, from here to there"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,97,All black and brown and covered with hair
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,98,He smelled that girl on the summer air
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,99,"The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,100,"I hope you're pleased. If I were armed, they'd never have taken us."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,101,You were armed when we were taken.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,102,"I was in chains, if you recall."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,103,Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,104,"All my life I've been hearing, ""Jaime Lannister,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,105,"""what a brilliant swordsman."""
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,106,You were slower than I expected. And more predictable.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,107,"I've been sitting in a muddy pen,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,108,"wrapped in chains, for the past year."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,109,I'm a woman. I was beating you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,110,You were not beating me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,111,Maybe you were as good as people said...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,112,Once.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,113,Or maybe people just love to over-praise a famous name.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,114,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,115,None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,116,- You'd be wise not to resist. - Would I?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,117,They'll knock your teeth out.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,118,You think I care?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,119,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,120,"If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,121,"I'm the prisoner of value, not you."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,122,Let them have what they want. What does it matter?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,123,What does it matter?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,124,Close your eyes.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,125,Pretend they're Renly.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,126,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,127,You'd let them do what they wanted?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,128,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the Gods."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,129,"If I had a proper forge, I'd make it good as new."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,130,Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,131,Why are you helping him?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,132,"He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,133,You're not our prisoner.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,134,What am I?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,135,Our guest.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,136,No one's put any chains on you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,137,"So I can walk away, then?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,138,These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,139,You're lucky we found you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,140,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,141,Better than anyone you've met.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,142,A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,143,I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,144,Why? So you can kiss him?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,145,You remember the last time you were here?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,146,Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,147,"Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,148,and I'd rather not see you no more.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,149,Watch your head.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,150,Off we go.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,151,Walk up!
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,152,What are you doing? We're about to leave.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,153,I'm staying.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,154,You're what?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,155,"I baked brown bread for the innkeep, she said she never had better."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,156,Told Thoros she's keeping me as payment for all his free meals.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,157,"Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,158,I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,159,Winterfell.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,160,- You sure? - I'm sure.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,161,"Well, I made you something."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,162,What is it?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,163,It's a wolf.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,164,"Yes, it is."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,165,That's the tail?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,166,Yeah.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,167,"Well, be safe."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,168,"Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,169,You don't burn your fingers.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,170,"Good-bye, Hot Pie."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,171,"Good-bye, Arry."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,172,"Up you go, little lady."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,173,"Hey, Hot Pie."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,174,It's really good.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,175,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,176,"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,177,in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,178,"I've missed you, Uncle."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,179,"Father missed you, too, from the day you left."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,180,Maybe he never said it in so many words...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,181,Maybe?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,182,Your father was a stubborn old ox.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,183,I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,184,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,185,Did you make peace in the end?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,186,"After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,187,He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,188,He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,189,"I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,190,they don't remember my real name.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,191,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,192,I'd see him off.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,193,"""Wait for me, little Cat,"" he'd say."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,194,"""Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."""
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,195,"And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,196,"I wonder,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,197,how many times did Bran or Rickon
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,198,"stare across the moors of Winterfell,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,199,waiting for me to return?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,200,I will never see them again.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,201,You mustn't think it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,202,We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,203,Robb believes they're alive.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,204,And he must go on believing.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,205,He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,206,And you must remain strong for him.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,207,You're Robb Stark's wife.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,208,Hold still.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,209,Is it true what they say about him?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,210,I don't know. What do they say about him?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,211,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,212,True.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,213,And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,214,True.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,215,"You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,216,Martyn Lannister.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,217,Martyn Lannister.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,218,You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,219,Unless it's a full moon.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,220,"It's not a full moon tonight, is it?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,221,See? Nothing to fear.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,222,Always the artists.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,223,It's only horses.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,224,No men.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,225,You said there was dead crows.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,226,There was.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,227,How many men were here?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,228,About 300.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,229,And you know what those men are now?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,230,"We're all the same to them, meat for their army."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,231,Do you think anyone got away?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,232,It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,233,"But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,234,And he lost.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,235,His best fighting men are dead.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,236,And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,237,"or a blue-eyed corpse,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,238,he's a long way from home.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,239,Tormund. Climb the Wall.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,240,Take Orell and 20 good men. And take this one.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,241,He knows Castle Black's defences better than any of us.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,242,"And if he's useful, good. If not, throw him off the Wall."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,243,See if crows can fly.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,244,"We're finally going to war, old friend?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,245,"Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,246,"They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,247,We'll meet again.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,248,- Aye. If you do your job. - Ah.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,249,How will we see your signal?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,250,Send your eagle above the Wall every night.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,251,"When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,252,the North has ever seen.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,253,Ghost?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,254,What have we here? Frozen crows?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,255,We've come a long way.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,256,Smaller flock than you went north with.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,257,We can talk inside.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,258,"Oh, can we?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,259,"They need some water. Tether it, and I'll be inside."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,260,Keep your eyes where they belong.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,261,They're not for you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,262,Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,263,"Aye, pig's got value to me."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,264,You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,265,I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,266,You are a godly man?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,267,I am. I got no fear of what's out there.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,268,"When the white cold comes,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,269,your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,270,The only ones left will be those who are right with the Gods.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,271,The real Gods.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,272,Go tell her she can bite down on a rag
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,273,or she can bite down on my fist.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,274,Women.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,275,That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,276,Barely a grunt.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,277,And she's almost as fat as this one here.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,278,Now why don't you dine on him?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,279,Carve off what you need as you go.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,280,"Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,281,"Here we are. Sharpen these for me, would ya?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,282,I see the head. Push. That's it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,283,You're nearly there.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,284,One more push should do it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,285,What is it? What is it?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,286,Keep quiet.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,287,"If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,288,I can ride.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,289,You're sure?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,290,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,291,I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,292,We're not in the Iron Islands.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,293,Go.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,294,Come on.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,295,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,296,Come on back.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,297,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,298,I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,299,How long will you be gone?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,300,I don't know.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,301,You're abandoning me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,302,I will never abandon you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,303,You are the Son of Fire.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,304,I am sworn to serve you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,305,Then serve me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,306,"When I return, you will understand."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,307,My enemies think they've destroyed me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,308,"They're laughing at me, the way Renly laughed at me."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,309,I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,310,Make me another son.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,311,I cannot.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,312,Why?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,313,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,314,I'm not easily killed. Men have tried for years.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,315,I want you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,316,"Your fires burn low, my king."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,317,There is another way. A better way.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,318,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,319,- Yes. - I'm the one true king.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,320,You are.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,321,There are others with your blood in their veins.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,322,"You will sit on the Iron Throne,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,323,but first there must be sacrifices.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,324,The Lord of Light demands it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,325,"The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,326,To whom?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,327,To any slave who contemplates doing
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,328,whatever these slaves did.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,329,Give me your water.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,330,"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,331,"Here, drink."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,332,"Leave this place, Your Grace."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,333,"Leave tonight, I beg you."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,334,And what is she to do for soldiers?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,335,We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,336,"Is it ""we"" already, Ser Barristan?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,337,If you want to sit on the throne
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,338,"your ancestors built, you must win it."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,339,That means blood on your hands before the thing is done.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,340,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,341,"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,342,- Three. - Have you ever seen a war
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,343,where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,344,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, Khaleesi."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,345,You know what I saw? Butchery.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,346,"Babies, children, old men."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,347,More women raped than you can count.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,348,"There's a beast in every man, and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,349,But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,350,They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,351,"If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,352,"You disagree, Ser Barristan?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,353,"When your brother led his army into battle at the Trident,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,354,"men died for him because they believed in him,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,355,"because they loved him,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,356,not because they'd been bought at an auction.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,357,I fought beside the last dragon on that day.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,358,I bled beside him.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,359,"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,360,and Rhaegar died.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,361,"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,362,"I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,363,I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,364,"All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,365,They did not. I want to buy them all.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,366,She wants to buy them all.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,367,She can't afford them.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,368,"The slut thinks she can flash her tits,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,369,and make us give her whatever she wants.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,370,"There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,371,"Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,372,"If they fail on the battlefield,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,373,they will shame Astapor.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,374,Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,375,"If they fail on the battlefield,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,376,they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,377,I will have them all or take none.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,378,Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,379,to pick up the swords they drop.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,380,The slut cannot pay for all of this.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,381,Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,382,"Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,383,Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,384,and this because I like the curve of her ass.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,385,Because Master Kraznys is generous.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,386,What is left will buy her 10.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,387,The gold you have left is worth 10.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,388,I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,389,But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,390,"Her Dothraki smell of shit,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,391,The Dothraki you have with you...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,392,but may be useful as pig feed.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,393,The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,394,I will give her 3 for those.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,395,but Master Kraznys will give you
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,396,three Unsullied for all of them.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,397,"So, ask this beggar queen,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,398,Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,399,"how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,400,"for the remaining 7,877 Unsullied?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,401,I have dragons. I'll give you one.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,402,"You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,403,"Khaleesi, please."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,404,Three dragons.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,405,- One. - Two.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,406,One.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,407,They want the biggest one.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,408,Done.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,409,Done.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,410,"I'll take you as well, now."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,411,You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,412,A token of a bargain well struck.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,413,"She asks that you give me to her, as a present."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,414,She asks that you do this now.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,415,"Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,416,than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,417,You're both here to advise me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,418,"I value your advice, but if you ever"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,419,"question me in front of strangers again,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,420,you'll be advising someone else.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,421,Is that understood?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,422,Do you have a name?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,423,"This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,424,Do you have a family? A mother and a father
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,425,you'd return to if you had the choice?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,426,"No, Your Grace. No family living."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,427,You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,428,"Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offence."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,429,Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,430,I offered water to a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,431,"Do you know what he said to me? ""Let me die."""
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,432,"There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,433,Is it true what Master Kraznys told me
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,434,about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,435,"All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,436,"Once they are yours, they are yours."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,437,They will fall on their swords if you command it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,438,And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,439,You may go hungry. You may fall sick.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,440,You may be killed.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,441,Valar Morghulis.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,442,"Yes, all men must die."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,443,But we are not men.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,444,A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,445,I'm surprised you're surprised.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,446,This is the safest place in the city.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,447,Not for bastards.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,448,"That's all of them, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,449,"Thank you, my dear. Pod."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,450,Pod. Take them outside.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,451,I'll be there in a moment.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,452,"Yes, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,453,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,454,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,455,You should have him knighted.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,456,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,457,If only.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,458,I owe you a significant debt.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,459,Our redheaded friend.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,460,You secured her release when the Queen detained her.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,461,"Oh, that."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,462,Of course. A simple misunderstanding.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,463,"Apparently, Her Grace believed"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,464,that you two had some sort of special relationship.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,465,We don't. I did fuck her once.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,466,- I know. - But we don't.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,467,I know.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,468,How'd the Queen get that idea?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,469,Why don't you ask her?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,470,Any advice for me on my new position?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,471,Keep a low profile.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,472,If I had a gold dragon
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,473,"for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,474,"Well, you are richer than I am."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,475,Good point.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,476,They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,477,"Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,478,Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,479,"I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,480,"Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,481,"Tonight, then."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,482,Looks like dull reading.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,483,You think all reading is dull reading.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,484,It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,485,The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,486,Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,487,to hide what he's really up to.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,488,"Unless he made it all up, yes."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,489,"Podrick, do keep up."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,490,"Yes, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,491,Podrick.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,492,"Yes, my lord?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,493,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,494,I finally found a suitable reward for the services
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,495,you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,496,"Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,497,"No, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,498,Wonderful.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,499,Genna specialises in first-timers.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,500,"She's not bad with second-timers, either."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,501,"Uh, my lord..."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,502,A fair enough repayment for putting your spear
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,503,"through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,504,"Now, as it happens,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,505,Marei
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,506,is quite the spear-handler herself.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,507,She's here to thank you for staying by my side
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,508,as the battle raged all around me.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,509,He's handsome.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,510,You didn't tell me he was handsome.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,511,Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,512,One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,513,"My lord, I don't even..."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,514,"She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,515,"who's never once failed to address me as ""my lord."""
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,516,Be back in time for my supper.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,517,"Pace yourself, lad."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,518,For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,519,"Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,520,"and, poof, mountains of gold."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,521,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,522,No.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,523,He's stealing it?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,524,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,525,What's wrong with that?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,526,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,527,The crown owes millions to my father.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,528,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,529,I imagine he'll forgive that debt.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,530,"Forgive a debt, my father?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,531,"For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,532,I've never borrowed money.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,533,- I'm not clear on the rules. - Well...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,534,"The basic principle is, I lend you money,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,535,"and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,536,What if I don't?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,537,"Well, you have to."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,538,But what if I don't?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,539,This is why I don't lend you money.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,540,"Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,541,It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,542,We owe them tens of millions.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,543,"If we fail to repay these loans,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,544,the bank will fund our enemies.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,545,"One way or another, they always get their gold back."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,546,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,547,Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,548,The lad's practically skipping.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,549,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,550,Or should I say my money's worth?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,551,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,552,He's a squire. You don't pay him.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,553,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,554,"They wouldn't take it, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,555,Maybe they're trying to curry some favour with the new Master of Coin.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,556,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,557,They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,558,What did you tell them?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,559,I didn't tell them anything.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,560,What did you do to them?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,561,Lots of things.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,562,And they seemed to like these things?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,563,"Yes, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,564,Of course they did. They're paid to seem to like it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,565,Only they weren't paid.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,566,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,567,they gave him the time for free?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,568,Is that what you're telling us?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,569,"Sit down, Podrick."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,570,We're going to need details.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,571,Copious details.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,572,Come on! Come on!
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,573,Come on! Come on.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,574,You know how we deal with runaways?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,575,Take off his pants.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,576,"No! No! No, no, no!"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,577,I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,578,"No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,579,"No, please! No! No!"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,580,You little bastard.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,581,"Come, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,582,"You're a long way from home, and winter is coming."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,583,I'll take the big bitch first.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,584,"When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,585,"My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,586,Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,587,to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,588,Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,589,Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,590,You're only making it worse.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,591,"Take her over there, where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,592,Come on!
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,593,"You know who she is, don't you?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,594,A big dumb bitch from who cares where.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,595,Never been with a woman that big.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,596,She's Brienne of Tarth.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,597,Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,598,I'm gonna cut your throat!
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,599,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,600,Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,601,Sapphires are gemstones.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,602,The blue ones.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,603,I know what they are.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,604,Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,605,in sapphires if she's returned to him.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,606,"But only if she's alive, her honour unbesmirched."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,607,Bring her back here.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,608,"Yes, my lord."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,609,Get up.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,610,Come on.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,611,"Come on, on your feet."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,612,Unbesmirched.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,613,Not defiled.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,614,Fancy word for a fancy man.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,615,"I hated to read as a child,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,616,but my father forced me to study every morning
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,617,before I could practise with sword or horse.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,618,Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,619,I learned a lot of fancy words.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,620,I bet you did.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,621,"Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,622,You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,623,"And your sons will be rich men, and their sons after them."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,624,"Lands, titles..."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,625,You'll have them all.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,626,The North can't win this war.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,627,You're a smart man. You understand that.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,628,We have the numbers. We have the gold.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,629,"Aye, you have both."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,630,Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,631,Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,632,Hard to argue with that.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,633,"Now that we're speaking together man to man,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,634,I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,635,"I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,636,"but if I could sleep lying down,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,637,my back would thank you for it.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,638,I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,639,None of us are.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,640,Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,641,"Come on, men."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,642,Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,643,"I'm famished, actually."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,644,I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,645,"Well, I do like partridge."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,646,Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,647,"Will this work as a table, my lord?"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,648,"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do..."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,649,On the stump.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,650,You think you're the smartest man there is.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,651,That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,652,My father...
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,653,"And if you get in any trouble,"
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,654,"all you've got to do is say ""my father"""
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,655,"and that's it, all your troubles are gone."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,656,Don't.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,657,Have you got something to say?
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,658,Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,659,"You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here."
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,660,Never forget that.
S03E03,Walk Of Punishment,661,"Here, this should help you remember."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,1,How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,2,Depends if he's had any practice.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,3,That the sort of thing you and your sister go in for?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,4,She loosened you up for us?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,5,He's going to fall.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,6,He's going to fall off his horse. Help him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,7,Water.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,8,"Water. Please, water."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,9,"Water. Water, please. Please. Please."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,10,"If I die, you won't be getting..."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,11,"Oh, enough."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,12,Here.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,13,Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,14,Stop!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,15,Far enough.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,16,Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,17,"Come on, you."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,18,"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,19,I hope we might speak in confidence.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,20,Oh. Always in confidence.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,21,About the events of the Blackwater.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,22,Perhaps this is the wrong time?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,23,"Oh, no, it's a wonderful time."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,24,I thought one of your little birds might
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,25,have knowledge of my sister's intentions to...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,26,End your life?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,27,I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,28,"along with his position, I'm afraid."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,29,Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,30,Proof?  Will there be a trial?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,31,I need to know.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,32,"I have no proof, only whispers."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,33,"Before all this nastiness,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,34,I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,35,Do you want to hear it still?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,36,I don't know. Do I?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,37,"As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,38,"One day in Myr,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,39,a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,40,I feared the man meant to use me
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,41,as I'd heard some men used small boys.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,42,But what he wanted was far worse.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,43,"He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,44,yet did nothing to dull my senses.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,45,"With a hooked blade he sliced me,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,46,"root and stem, chanting all the while."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,47,He burned my parts in a brazier.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,48,"The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,49,I still dream of that night.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,50,"Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,51,I dream of the voice from the flames.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,52,Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,53,I don't know.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,54,But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,55,"And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,56,But you can see why I was eager to aid in your
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,57,fight against Stannis and his red priestess.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,58,A symbolic revenge of sorts.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,59,Yes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,60,I feel the need for actual revenge against
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,61,"the actual person who tried to have me killed,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,62,"which will require a degree of influence, which..."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,63,You do not possess at the moment.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,64,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,65,"Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,66,he threw me out of his house to die.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,67,I resolved to live to spite him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,68,I begged.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,69,I sold what parts of my body remained to me.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,70,"I became an excellent thief,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,71,and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,72,are more valuable than the contents of his purse.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,73,"Step by step, one distasteful task after another,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,74,I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council chamber.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,75,Influence grows like a weed.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,76,I tended mine patiently
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,77,until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,78,"all the way across to the far side of the world,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,79,where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,80,Ugh.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,81,The sorcerer.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,82,"Hello, my old friend."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,83,It's been a long time.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,84,"I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,85,if you have the stomach for it.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,86,"When people talk about the Night's Watch,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,87,they never mention the shovelling.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,88,Or the shit.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,89,"They tell you about honour,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,90,"pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,91,but shovelling really is most of it.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,92,And getting attacked or killed or worse.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,93,And that.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,94,"But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shovelling."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,95,"Ah, look. More shit."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,96,I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,97,We need to get out of here.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,98,"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,99,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,100,How'd that turn out for us?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,101,He had no way of knowing.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,102,We do now. We know what's out there.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,103,Craster's been out here surviving.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,104,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,105,We're like the sons he never had.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,106,Mormont isn't gonna save you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,107,This lummox here isn't gonna save you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,108,"When the Walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,109,"If we want to live,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,110,we'll have to look out for ourselves.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,111,You woke him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,112,I'm sorry.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,113,- He's beautiful. - Shh!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,114,He's beautiful.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,115,- Does he have a name? - No.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,116,Are you going to give him one?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,117,Why?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,118,- Here. - Gilly.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,119,You said to hold it for you until you came back.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,120,- You're back. - I wanted you to have it.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,121,I don't want your stupid thimble.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,122,I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,123,Can you?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,124,I don't have time for you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,125,I don't have time for anyone but him
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,126,because he doesn't have much time.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,127,You have to go after him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,128,How?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,129,You know how.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,130,Brandon.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,131,- Mother. - How many times have I told you?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,132,No climbing.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,133,"Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,134,I want you to promise me. No more climbing. Promise me.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,135,Promise me! Promise me!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,136,Mother! Mother!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,137,"Promise me, Bran!"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,138,Promise me!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,139,Is he very large?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,140,"No larger than usual, apparently."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,141,"And yet, they said that he was..."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,142,Extraordinary.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,143,The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,144,We're talking about the same Podrick?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,145,The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,146,What did he do to them?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,147,"I don't know, my lord."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,148,The girls are usually quite descriptive.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,149,So what did they say?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,150,They said it was hard to describe.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,151,Huh.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,152,Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,153,And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,154,He was too preoccupied to notice.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,155,He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,156,I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,157,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,158,Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,159,"Sad, really."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,160,Is that all it takes to make our friend
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,161,lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,162,"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,163,Hmm.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,164,But I don't think he's lost interest.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,165,What makes you say so?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,166,His shipboard inventory.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,167,You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,168,- Former profession. - Of course.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,169,I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,170,Two featherbeds.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,171,He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,172,Who is important enough to Littlefinger
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,173,"to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,174,Could he be bringing one of his girls?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,175,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,176,How do you know?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,177,Because I'm one of his girls.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,178,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,179,Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,180,"by her brother, or rather, his dragon."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,181,It ate her while her son watched.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,182,What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,183,"The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,184,which seats 700 comfortably.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,185,There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,186,on the premises for everyone else.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,187,There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,188,"No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,189,to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,190,"Over there, in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,191,"Aerion Brightflame, they called him."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,192,He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,193,He was wrong.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,194,"And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,195,Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,196,Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,197,"No, it's quite all right, Your Grace."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,198,"I'd love to see their tombs, really."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,199,It's like taking a walk through history.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,200,The tomb's just up here.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,201,This is so exciting.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,202,"You were married here, Your Grace?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,203,Yes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,204,Must seem like only yesterday.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,205,Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,206,Your husband was buried here as well?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,207,"No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,208,Such a tragedy.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,209,A fairly predictable tragedy.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,210,Hunting and drinking don't mix.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,211,I should say not.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,212,My son's a hunter. It helps him forget
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,213,he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,214,I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,215,All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,216,I told him to stay out of Robert's Rebellion.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,217,He had no business fighting an actual warrior.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,218,We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,219,But they do seem to yearn for it.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,220,"We shower them with good sense,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,221,"and it slides right off, like rain off a wing."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,222,And yet the world belongs to them.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,223,"A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,224,The Gods have seen fit to make it so.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,225,My father didn't want them here.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,226,"He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,227,but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,228,I'm glad he did.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,229,"I'm sorry, Your Grace."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,230,"I know they did terrible things at the end,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,231,but their ancestors built this.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,232,Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,233,I couldn't agree more.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,234,Shall we go and see them?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,235,"If you give them your love, they will return it a thousand fold."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,236,I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,237,You led the defence of King's Landing.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,238,They adore you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,239,Open the doors.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,240,Joffrey.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,241,Wait.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,242,- Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,243,"Bless you, Lady Margaery!"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,244,Lady Margaery!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,245,Lady Margaery!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,246,Margaery!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,247,Long live Lady Margaery!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,248,King Joffrey!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,249,King Joffrey!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,250,King Joffrey!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,251,King Joffrey!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,252,King Joffrey!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,253,Gods bless King Joffrey!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,254,How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,255,"Not far, my lord."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,256,Your sister is waiting for you there.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,257,- She sent you to save me? - Yes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,258,"I served them, the men who were torturing you."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,259,I did what they told and waited.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,260,Why would you risk your life for me?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,261,"I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,262,I was only a boy when they took you away.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,263,My father brought us up to the bluffs
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,264,so we could watch you carried off.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,265,"I remember the look on my father's face when he told us,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,266,"""That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."""
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,267,And those are the words I heard over again
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,268,when I saw what they were doing to you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,269,"Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,270,Did he?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,271,"I don't know, my lord. They... They never told me much."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,272,My sister's men are loyal to her.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,273,We don't need to hide from them.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,274,Not all those are your sister's men.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,275,Some of them are loyal to your father.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,276,Hmm.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,277,What is it?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,278,I was just thinking how jealous I was
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,279,when my father told Yara to take this place.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,280,What did he tell you to do?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,281,Raid fishing villages.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,282,He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,283,I could never be a Stark.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,284,Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,285,He lorded it over you?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,286,Didn't have to.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,287,All he had to do was be.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,288,Be who he was born to be.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,289,His life fit him better than his clothes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,290,How could someone like that ever be a brother to me?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,291,He's the King in the North.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,292,And me...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,293,My father gave me a choice and I made it.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,294,I could never be a Stark.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,295,"But ironborn, that's what I was born to be."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,296,I paid the iron price for Winterfell.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,297,I murdered those boys.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,298,The Stark boys?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,299,Never found them.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,300,Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,301,"I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,302,so I could keep Winterfell
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,303,and make my father proud.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,304,Maybe it's not too late.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,305,It is.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,306,My real father lost his head at King's Landing.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,307,"I made a choice,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,308,and I chose wrong.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,309,And now I've burned everything down.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,310,"Not everything, my lord."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,311,She's up here.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,312,- Yara. - Shh!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,313,Wait.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,314,I brought him back. He... He killed the others.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,315,"What? No, I didn't."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,316,You can't!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,317,"No! Please, stop!"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,318,No!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,319,Put him back where he belongs.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,320,Eat.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,321,What are you doing?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,322,I'm dying.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,323,You can't die.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,324,You need to live to take revenge.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,325,I don't care about revenge.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,326,You coward.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,327,A little misfortune and you're giving up.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,328,Misfor...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,329,Misfortune?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,330,You lost your hand.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,331,My sword hand. I was that hand.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,332,"You have a taste,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,333,one taste of the real world
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,334,"where people have important things taken from them,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,335,and you whine and cry and quit.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,336,You sound like a bloody woman.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,337,I know what you did for me.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,338,You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,339,It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,340,You knew that.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,341,Why did you help me?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,342,You wanted to speak to me?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,343,"Yes, about Jaime."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,344,What about him?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,345,I wanted to make sure we're doing
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,346,everything we can to get him back.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,347,"When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,348,what did I do in response?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,349,You started a war.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,350,"And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,351,what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,352,Whatever you can.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,353,Whatever I can.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,354,You're still here.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,355,Yes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,356,Why?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,357,Did it ever occur to you that
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,358,I might be the one who deserves
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,359,"your confidence and your trust,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,360,not your sons?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,361,"Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,362,Years and years of lectures on family and legacy...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,363,"The same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,364,Did it ever occur to you that your daughter
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,365,"might be the only one listening to them, living by them?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,366,That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,367,that you love so much more than your actual children?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,368,All right. Contribute.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,369,The Tyrells are a problem.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,370,The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,371,"The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,372,Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,373,She knows how to manipulate him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,374,Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,375,I don't distrust you because you're a woman.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,376,I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,377,You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,378,over you and everyone else in this city.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,379,Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,380,I will.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,381,"Do you like it, Nana?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,382,Another golden rose. How original.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,383,I eat from plates stamped with roses.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,384,I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,385,"I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,386,as if that makes it smell any better.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,387,"Roses are boring, dear."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,388,"""Growing strong."""
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,389,Ha! The dullest words of any house.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,390,"""Winter is coming!"" Now that's memorable."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,391,"""We do not sow."" Strong. Strong."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,392,Those are houses you watch out for.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,393,"Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,394,"But a golden rose growing strong,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,395,that strikes fear in the heart.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,396,"Look, little loves."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,397,A spider in the garden.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,398,Run along now. Grow strong.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,399,My lady.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,400,I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,401,The city has been made brighter by your presence.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,402,The city is made brighter by my presence?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,403,"Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,404,"A little obvious, perhaps."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,405,"Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,406,Though I rather think it's all for naught.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,407,What happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepit?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,408,A question for the philosophers.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,409,But you've come mincing all this way for something.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,410,- So? - Might I sit?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,411,No.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,412,"Come, I've heard you're such a clever man."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,413,I'm curious why you've sought me out.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,414,You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,415,Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,416,and one of your little spies came running to tell you?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,417,Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,418,Is she?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,419,"No, not particularly."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,420,But she's had an interesting childhood.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,421,"She has, sadly."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,422,"Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,423,I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,424,"Come, come. You surrender rather easily."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,425,Walk with me.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,426,"I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,427,"I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,428,Which is Sansa Stark?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,429,Neither. A babe in the woods.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,430,I admired her father.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,431,Yes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,432,"Ned Stark had many admirers,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,433,and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,434,I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,435,How?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,436,You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,437,That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,438,Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,439,It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,440,Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,441,A confidant of mine has told me that
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,442,"when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,443,And why have you come to me with this matter?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,444,"Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,445,He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,446,"Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,447,and this is the truth.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,448,Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,449,"If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,450,"And if he marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,451,Which seems such a shame.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,452,Why should a man with such a low reputation
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,453,steal away such a lovely bride?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,454,You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,455,"Actually, I rather enjoy him."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,456,But he would see this country burn
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,457,if he could be king of the ashes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,458,"You are a clever man, Lord Varys."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,459,You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,460,"One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,461,I didn't mean to disturb you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,462,You haven't.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,463,"We'd like some privacy, please."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,464,If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,465,"Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,466,I'll ask the King to speak with you himself.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,467,What did you pray for?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,468,I can't tell you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,469,Why not?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,470,I'll tell you what I prayed for in the Sept this morning.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,471,"Let's see, for my family's health and happiness,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,472,"for an end to the war, for a short winter."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,473,"Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,474,"I'm sorry, I just can't."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,475,My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,476,"When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,477,and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,478,"""Pig Face,"" she called me."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,479,"""Pig Face""? That's ridiculous."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,480,It had something to do with my nose.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,481,"Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,482,So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,483,"A week after that, she came down with porridge plague."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,484,Porridge plague?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,485,"Oh, you don't have it in the North?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,486,"Your skin starts to look like boiled oats,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,487,"and eventually, your face slides off and you die in agony."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,488,But that's awful.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,489,You're...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,490,I believed you!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,491,Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,492,"Don't say that. No, you're not."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,493,So what happened to Alanna?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,494,"Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,495,and married a handsome lord and they have darling children
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,496,and live in a castle by the sea.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,497,It's all terribly frustrating.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,498,I'm sure she's jealous of you now.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,499,"You'll be married here in the capital,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,500,and she'll have to come watch and
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,501,pretend to be happy that you're queen.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,502,"I want us to be friends, good friends."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,503,That would make me very happy.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,504,You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,505,We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,506,You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,507,"Uh, I don't think the Queen would let me leave King's Landing."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,508,"The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,509,"And if you were to marry Loras,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,510,"your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,511,"We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,512,His name was Bannen.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,513,"He was a good man, a good ranger."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,514,He came to us from...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,515,Where did he come from?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,516,Down White Harbor way.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,517,He came to us from White Harbor.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,518,Never failed in his duty.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,519,He kept his vows the best he could.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,520,"He rode far, fought fiercely."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,521,We shall never see his like again.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,522,And now his watch has ended.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,523,And now his watch has ended.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,524,Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,525,It wasn't his foot that killed him.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,526,That bastard Craster starved him to death.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,527,Craster's got his daughters to feed.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,528,You on his side?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,529,We can't just show up and steal all his food.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,530,"We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,531,"The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,532,and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,533,and laugh at us starving in the snow.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,534,He's a bloody wildling.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,535,Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,536,"You have one son, don't you, Mormont?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,537,I had my 99th.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,538,You ever meet a man with 99 sons?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,539,And more daughters than I can count.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,540,I'm glad for you.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,541,Are you now?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,542,"Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,543,As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,544,Ah!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,545,They're as strong as they're gonna get.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,546,"Them that's dying, why don't you"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,547,cut their throats and be done with it?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,548,"Or leave them if you've not the stomach, and I'll sort them myself."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,549,"Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,550,Wait outside.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,551,It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,552,My wives gave you bread.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,553,There's sawdust in the bread.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,554,"You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,555,I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,556,I told you to wait outside.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,557,"He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,558,I gave you crows enough.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,559,I've got to feed my women!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,560,You admit you've got a hidden larder?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,561,How else you make it through winter?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,562,- Enough! Out! - I am a godly man.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,563,You're a stingy bastard!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,564,Bastard?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,565,"Out with you, you little thief."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,566,And you! And you!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,567,Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,568,I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,569,You are a bastard.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,570,"A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,571,The Gods will curse us for this.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,572,By all the laws...
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,573,There are no laws beyond the Wall.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,574,"Show us where he hides the food, or you'll get the same as him."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,575,Unhand her.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,576,I shall have your head for this.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,577,Quickly. Quickly.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,578,What's happening?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,579,I'm not going out there.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,580,"No, we have to go. Now!"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,581,Follow me. I know the best way.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,582,Come on.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,583,"Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,584,I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,585,Can I take this hood off yet?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,586,"I do apologise, little lady,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,587,but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,588,Halt!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,589,- What is it? - Blackstrap rum.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,590,Ugh!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,591,Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,592,I'd have some.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,593,Let's go home.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,594,What is this place?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,595,Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,596,You look like a bunch of swineherds.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,597,Some of us were swineherds.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,598,And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,599,You're still swineherds and tanners and masons.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,600,You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,601,No.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,602,Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,603,Beric Dondarrion?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,604,You've seen better days.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,605,And I won't see them again.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,606,Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,607,"You lot aren't fighting in a war, you're running from it."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,608,"Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,609,"But here you are 1,000 miles from home. Which of us is running?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,610,Untie these ropes and we'll find out.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,611,What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,612,Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,613,Ned Stark is dead.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,614,King Robert is dead.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,615,My brother's alive.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,616,You're fighting for ghosts.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,617,"That's what we are, ghosts waiting for you in the dark."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,618,"You can't see us, but we see you."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,619,"No matter whose cloak you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,620,"you prey on the weak,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,621,the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,622,You found god? Is that it?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,623,Aye.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,624,I've been reborn in the light of the one true god.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,625,As have we all.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,626,As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,627,"If you mean to murder me, then get on with it."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,628,"You'll die soon enough, dog."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,629,"But it won't be murder, only justice."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,630,"And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions, you call yourselves."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,631,"At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,632,and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,633,I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,634,Dump your dead children at some other door.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,635,House Clegane was built upon dead children.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,636,I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,637,Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,638,Murder is a crime.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,639,I never touched the Targaryen babes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,640,"I never saw them, never smelt them, never heard them bawling."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,641,"You want to cut my throat, get on with it!"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,642,But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,643,You murdered Mycah.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,644,The butcher's boy. My friend.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,645,He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,646,You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,647,"Aye, he was a bleeder."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,648,You don't deny killing this boy?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,649,I was Joffrey's sworn shield.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,650,- The boy attacked the prince. - That's a lie!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,651,I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,652,Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,653,You stand accused of murder.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,654,But no one here knows the truth
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,655,"of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,656,Only the Lord of Light may do that now.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,657,I sentence you to trial by combat.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,658,"So, who will it be?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,659,"Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,660,"Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,661,Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,662,Aye.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,663,She might be.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,664,But it's me you'll fight.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,665,The master says they are untested.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,666,He says you would be wise to blood them early.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,667,There are many small cities between
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,668,"here and there, cities ripe for sacking."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,669,"Should you take captives, the masters will"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,670,buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,671,And who knows?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,672,"In 10 years, some of the boys you send them"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,673,may be Unsullied in their turn.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,674,"Thus, all shall prosper."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,675,"Is it done, then? They belong to me?"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,676,It is done.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,677,It is done.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,678,She holds the whip.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,679,You hold the whip.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,680,This bitch has her army.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,681,Unsullied!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,682,Forward march!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,683,Halt!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,684,Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,685,A dragon is not a slave.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,686,You speak Valyrian?
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,687,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,688,of the blood of Old Valyria.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,689,Valyrian is my mother tongue.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,690,Unsullied!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,691,"Slay the masters,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,692,"slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip,"
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,693,but harm no child.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,694,Strike the chains off every slave you see!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,695,I am your master!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,696,Kill her! Kill her!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,697,Kill her!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,698,Dracarys.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,699,Unsullied!
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,700,You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,701,"Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him."
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,702,I give you my word.
S03E04,And Now His Watch Is Ended,703,Will you fight for me? As free men?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,1,"Lord,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,2,cast your light upon us.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,3,"Lord of Light, defend us."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,4,Show us the truth.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,5,Strike this man down if he is guilty.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,6,Give strength to his sword if he is true.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,7,"Lord of Light, give us wisdom,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,8,for the night is dark and full of terrors.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,9,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,10,Get back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,11,Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,12,Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,13,- Guilty. - Kill him!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,14,"Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,15,Bring him back from death and darkness. Restore his flame.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,16,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,17,"- Lord, cast... - Arya, don't!"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,18,Bring him back from death and darkness...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,19,No! Let go of me! Let me go!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,20,Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,21,Burn in hell!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,22,He will.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,23,But not today.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,24,Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,25,Tell me what you know.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,26,"There are four to a patrol, two builders to check for structural damage,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,27,two rangers to watch for enemies.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,28,How often do these patrols go out?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,29,It varies.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,30,"If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,31,You'd like to know that.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,32,There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,33,How many are manned?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,34,Three.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,35,You sure of that?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,36,Which three?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,37,Castle Black.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,38,"Aye, Castle Black."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,39,Everyone knows Castle Black.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,40,Which others?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,41,Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,42,How many men remain in Castle Black?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,43,- A thousand. - Liar.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,44,What happens to your eagle after I kill you?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,45,"Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,46,or does he just flop dead to the ground?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,47,He's no crow.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,48,"Just 'cause you want him inside, you don't make him one of us."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,49,I'm not afraid of you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,50,"I like you, boy."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,51,"But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,52,A thousand men.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,53,We'll find out soon enough.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,54,I don't need you to protect me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,55,Of course you do.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,56,Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,57,Who vouched for you with Mance?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,58,It seems you owe me a debt.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,59,Give it back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,60,"Well, I stole it."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,61,"It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,62,Ygritte!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,63,Ygritte!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,64,Ygritte! Seven hells.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,65,Ygritte!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,66,Is Orell right? Are you still a crow?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,67,It's time you proved yourself.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,68,Ygritte.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,69,You swore some vows.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,70,I want you to break 'em.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,71,I want you to see me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,72,All of me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,73,We shouldn't.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,74,We should.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,75,"Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Snow."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,76,That thing you did with your mouth...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,77,Is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,78,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,79,Hmm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,80,You seemed to like it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,81,"Aye, I liked it some."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,82,Who taught you that?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,83,There's been no one else. Only you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,84,A maid.  You were a maid.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,85,I was a man of the Night's Watch.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,86,How about you? Were you a maid?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,87,What do you think?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,88,Who was he?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,89,Just a boy.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,90,He came trading with his brothers.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,91,He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,92,He was weak. Not like you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,93,That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,94,"Spoke no Common, but, Gods, he was built like a mammoth..."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,95,"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,96,We'd best get back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,97,Tormund...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,98,I'm not done with you yet.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,99,How long's it been since you had a bath?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,100,Let's not go back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,101,Let's stay here a while longer.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,102,"I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,103,Not ever.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,104,I want my gold.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,105,"It says clearly on that note, you'll be paid when the war is over."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,106,Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,107,We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,108,"Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,109,You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,110,Not in the eyes of God.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,111,- You can't! - Enough!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,112,The judgement isn't ours to make.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,113,"Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,114,Riders coming through!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,115,The Kingslayer.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,116,Down!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,117,On your knees.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,118,"Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,119,"Pick him up, Locke."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,120,You've lost a hand.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,121,"No, my lord, he has it here."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,122,Take this away.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,123,Send it to his father?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,124,You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,125,Cut her free.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,126,"Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,127,"Thank you, my lord."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,128,Find suitable rooms for our guests.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,129,We'll speak later.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,130,Lord Bolton.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,131,Is there word from the capital?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,132,You haven't heard?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,133,Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,134,Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,135,And your sister...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,136,How can I put this?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,137,Your sister...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,138,Is alive and well.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,139,Your father's forces prevailed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,140,Ser Jaime isn't well.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,141,Take him to Qyburn.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,142,Will I die?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,143,No.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,144,The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,145,The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,146,Then you'll die.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,147,You're no maester.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,148,Where's your chain?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,149,The Citadel stripped me of it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,150,They found some of my experiments too bold.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,151,"I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,152,I don't need my right hand to kill you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,153,I can take away the rotting flesh
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,154,and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,155,Mmm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,156,"With any luck, that will suffice."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,157,You'll need milk of the poppy.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,158,No milk of the poppy.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,159,There will be pain.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,160,I'll scream.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,161,Quite a bit of pain.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,162,I'll scream loudly.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,163,Lord Baelish.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,164,Your Grace.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,165,I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,166,"Of course, Your Grace."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,167,I believe that House Tyrell don't hold the crown's best interests at heart.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,168,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,169,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,170,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,171,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,172,He's almost as generous to those who help us
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,173,as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,174,You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,175,I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,176,- I shall do my best. - Thank you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,177,And your best will prove better than
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,178,when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,179,I assure you that it will.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,180,"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,181,"- Pardon, my lady. - No need to speak."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,182,Are there any figs? Fetch some.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,183,I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,184,To what do I owe this summons?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,185,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,186,I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,187,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,188,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,189,Naturally.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,190,It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,191,"The word ""extravagant"" has been used."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,192,"What good is the word ""extravagant"""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,193,if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,194,- I understand that. - Good.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,195,"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,196,to calculate the cost for the crown.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,197,"As of now, it's a huge expense."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,198,And?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,199,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,200,"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,201,And maintaining supply lines...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,202,I can't think how it slipped my mind.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,203,"What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,204,"1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,205,"Provisions, so this city might survive the winter."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,206,A million bushels of wheat.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,207,"Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,208,"20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,209,You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,210,I'm quite familiar with them.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,211,"And we are grateful for your contributions,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,212,which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,213,As is a royal wedding.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,214,The people are hungry for more than just food.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,215,They crave distractions.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,216,"And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,217,And their distractions are likely to
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,218,end with us being torn to pieces.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,219,A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,220,I would.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,221,And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,222,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,223,Imagine my disappointment at finding
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,224,nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,225,"Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,226,"- My lady... - Oh, very well."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,227,I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,228,"We'll pay for half, and the celebrations will go on as planned."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,229,- Is that sufficient? - Quite. Thank you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,230,"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,231,Give me that.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,232,What are you doing?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,233,Just mending Lord Beric's armour.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,234,Why?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,235,I'm going to stay and smith for the Brotherhood.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,236,Have you lost your mind?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,237,"When the Lannisters find this place,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,238,you think they'll spare the smiths?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,239,They'll cave your head in.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,240,They wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,241,You don't have to.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,242,I want to. They need good men.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,243,"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,244,And then you...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,245,What? Serve him?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,246,I've served men my entire life.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,247,"I served Master Mott at King's Landing, and he sold me to the Watch."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,248,"I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,249,wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,250,- I'm done serving. - You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,251,"He may be their leader, but they chose him."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,252,These men are brothers. They're a family.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,253,I've never had a family.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,254,I can be your family.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,255,"You wouldn't be my family. You'd be ""my lady."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,256,Willem.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,257,Willem!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,258,Is this a rescue?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,259,Lannister filth! Take him!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,260,"Please, I didn't do anything."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,261,I'm just a squire. Please...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,262,Bring them in.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,263,Is that all of them?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,264,It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,265,"Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,266,Vengeance?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,267,Those boys didn't kill your sons.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,268,"I saw Harrion die on the battlefield, and Torrhen..."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,269,Was strangled by the Kingslayer.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,270,- They were his kin. - They were boys!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,271,Look at them.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,272,Tell your mother to look at them.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,273,She killed them as much as I.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,274,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,275,It's treason to free your enemies.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,276,"In war, you kill your enemies."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,277,"Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,278,Leave him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,279,Aye.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,280,Leave me to the King.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,281,He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,282,That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,283,Or should I call him
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,284,the King Who Lost the North?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,285,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,286,Mercy! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,287,This one was only the watcher.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,288,"Hang him last, so he can watch the others die."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,289,"Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,290,Word of this can't leave Riverrun.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,291,They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,292,The Lannisters pay their debts.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,293,They never stop talking about it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,294,Would you make me a liar as well?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,295,It wouldn't be lying.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,296,We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,297,I'm not fighting for justice
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,298,"if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,299,no matter how highborn.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,300,He has to die.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,301,The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,302,"Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,303,You tended to their wounds.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,304,You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,305,And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,306,You need Karstark men to end it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,307,Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,308,A hostage.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,309,"Tell the Karstarks that as long as they're loyal, he will not be harmed."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,310,The blood of the First Men flows through
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,311,"my veins as much as yours, boy."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,312,I fought the Mad King for your father.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,313,I fought Joffrey for you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,314,"We are kin, Stark and Karstark."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,315,"That didn't stop you from betraying me, and it won't save you now."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,316,I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,317,"Kneel, my lord."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,318,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,319,"here, in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,320,Would you speak a final word?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,321,Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,322,Joffrey.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,323,Cersei.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,324,Ilyn Payne.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,325,Ser Meryn.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,326,The Hound.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,327,What are you going to do with me?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,328,At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,329,"He'll make a contribution to our cause, and you can go home."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,330,I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,331,Don't think of it that way.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,332,But it is that way.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,333,It is.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,334,And it isn't.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,335,More is than isn't.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,336,"Beric admired your father a great deal, you know."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,337,He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,338,"So, why don't you?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,339,We need the gold.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,340,"Do I frighten you, child?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,341,No.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,342,"You're angry with me, and I don't blame you,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,343,but letting him go was the right thing.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,344,I have more reason to want him hanged.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,345,I thought he killed you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,346,He did.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,347,But how...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,348,"Thoros, how many times have you brought me back?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,349,It's the Lord of Light who brings you back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,350,I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,351,How many times?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,352,"Five, I think."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,353,"No, this makes six."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,354,Six.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,355,There was the first time. The Mountain.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,356,Show her.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,357,Lance right through the chest.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,358,Then I was stabbed in the belly.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,359,Then it was an arrow in the back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,360,And that axe in the side.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,361,Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,362,Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,363,Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,364,And the Hound makes six.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,365,Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,366,You'd think you'd learn.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,367,"It's not getting any easier, you know."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,368,I know.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,369,"Every time I come back,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,370,I'm a bit less.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,371,Pieces of you get chipped away.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,372,Could you bring back a man without a head?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,373,Not six times. Just once.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,374,"I don't think it works that way, child."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,375,"He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,376,I would never wish my life upon him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,377,I would.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,378,You're alive.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,379,"Lord, cast your light upon me."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,380,Protect me in the darkness.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,381,Burn away my sins.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,382,Help me serve you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,383,Use me as you will.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,384,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,385,I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,386,My lady.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,387,I meant to come sooner.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,388,The battle...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,389,"I know of your troubles, my King."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,390,The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,391,"Yes, of course."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,392,You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,393,I believed that once.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,394,You are the One God's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,395,Selyse.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,396,I've broken a sacred vow.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,397,I've sinned.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,398,No.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,399,I've wronged you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,400,I have shamed you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,401,You're doing God's work.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,402,You don't understand.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,403,The Red Woman...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,404,The Lady Melisandre...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,405,"I know, Stannis."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,406,The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,407,No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,408,"When she told me,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,409,I wept with joy.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,410,"Oh, my sweet boys."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,411,"Petyr, Tommard, Edric."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,412,I thank God every day for bringing Melisandre to us.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,413,She gave you a son.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,414,I gave you
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,415,- nothing. - That's not true.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,416,"So, you've come to see her as well?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,417,There is no need.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,418,You must keep away from such distractions.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,419,She's my daughter.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,420,I want to see her.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,421,You are a king. You don't need my permission.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,422,"The sea I know, I know"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,423,"Oh, oh, oh"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,424,The birds have scales
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,425,And the fish take wing
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,426,"I know, I know"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,427,"Oh, oh, oh"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,428,Shireen.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,429,Father!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,430,You've grown since I last saw you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,431,Mother said you fought in a battle.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,432,Did you win?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,433,No.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,434,Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,435,He did. He fought bravely.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,436,He hasn't come to visit me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,437,He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,438,"He won't be visiting, child."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,439,Why not? He's my friend.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,440,Look.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,441,He made this for me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,442,But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,443,Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,444,Ser Davos is a traitor.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,445,He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,446,Best forget him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,447,Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,448,What are you doing here?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,449,I need a bath.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,450,Help me out of these rags.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,451,Now get out.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,452,There's another tub.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,453,This one suits me fine.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,454,Don't worry. I'm not interested.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,455,"If I faint, pull me out."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,456,I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,457,Why should I care how you die?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,458,"You swore a solemn vow, remember?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,459,You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,460,"Not going so well, is it?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,461,"No wonder Renly died, with you guarding him."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,462,That was unworthy. Forgive me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,463,- You protected me better than most... - Don't you mock me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,464,I'm apologising.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,465,I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,466,You need trust to have a truce.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,467,I trust you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,468,There it is. There's the look.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,469,"I've seen it for 17 years, on face after face."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,470,You all despise me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,471,Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,472,A man without honour.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,473,You've heard of wildfire?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,474,Of course.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,475,The Mad King was obsessed with it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,476,"He loved to watch people burn,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,477,the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,478,He burned lords he didn't like.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,479,He burned Hands who disobeyed him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,480,He burned anyone who was against him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,481,"Before long, half the country was against him."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,482,"Aerys saw traitors everywhere,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,483,"so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,484,beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,485,"Under houses, stables, taverns."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,486,Even beneath the Red Keep itself.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,487,"Finally, the day of reckoning came."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,488,Robert Baratheon marched on the capital
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,489,after his victory at the Trident.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,490,"But my father arrived first, with the whole Lannister army at his back,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,491,promising to defend the city against the rebels.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,492,I knew my father better than that.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,493,He's never been one to pick the losing side.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,494,I told the Mad King as much.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,495,I urged him to surrender peacefully.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,496,But the King didn't listen to me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,497,"He didn't listen to Varys, who tried to warn him."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,498,"But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,499,"that grey, sunken cunt."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,500,"""You can trust the Lannisters,"" he said."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,501,"""The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,502,"So, we opened the gates, and my father sacked the city."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,503,"Once again, I came to the King, begging him to surrender."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,504,He told me to bring him my father's head.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,505,Then he turned to his pyromancer.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,506,"""Burn them all,"" he said."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,507,"""Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,508,"Tell me, if your precious Renly"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,509,commanded you to kill your own father
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,510,"and stand by while thousands of men,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,511,"women, and children burned alive,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,512,would you have done it?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,513,Would you have kept your oath then?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,514,"First, I killed the pyromancer."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,515,"And then, when the King turned to flee,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,516,I drove my sword into his back.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,517,"""Burn them all,"" he kept saying. ""Burn them all."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,518,I don't think he expected to die.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,519,He meant to burn with the rest of us
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,520,"and rise again,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,521,reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,522,I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,523,That's where Ned Stark found me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,524,If this is true...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,525,Why didn't you tell anyone?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,526,Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,527,Stark?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,528,You think the honourable Ned Stark
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,529,wanted to hear my side?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,530,He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,531,By what right does the wolf judge the lion?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,532,- By what right? - Help! Help!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,533,The Kingslayer!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,534,Jaime. My name is Jaime.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,535,Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,536,"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,537,Shh! You'll wake Bert.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,538,Bert?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,539,He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,540,He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,541,Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,542,- If your father knew... - He said you were a traitor.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,543,Are you?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,544,"I am, child."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,545,"I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,546,I don't care. You're my friend.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,547,You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,548,It's about Aegon and his dragons.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,549,Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,550,- And the Targaryens built this castle. - Aye.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,551,So they did.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,552,You can hide the book under your cloak.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,553,It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,554,"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,555,- but it's wasted on me. - Take it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,556,I have more.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,557,"My lady, I can't read the words."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,558,You can't?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,559,I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,560,- No. No. No. - It's easy. It'll be fun.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,561,Go. We can't.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,562,"Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,563,- I wouldn't know where to start. - At the beginning.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,564,"This word is ""Aegon."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,565,"When you see ""A,"" ""E,"" and ""G"" together like that,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,566,"it sounds like ""egg."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,567,And the title of the whole book
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,568,is An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,569,- It was a bitch of a siege. - Mmm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,570,You were first through the breach at Pyke?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,571,The second.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,572,"Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,573,Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,574,Robert knighted you after the battle?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,575,Proudest moment of my life.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,576,"One knee in the dust, the King's sword on my shoulder,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,577,"listening to the words,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,578,"""In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."""
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,579,All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,580,In full plate metal for 16 hours.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,581,Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,582,I was very nearly the first man
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,583,knighted to piss on the King's boots.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,584,Robert would have laughed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,585,"He was a good man, a great warrior."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,586,And a terrible king.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,587,I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,588,- You swore an oath. - Yes.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,589,"And a man of honour keeps his vows,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,590,even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,591,"Just once in my life before it's over,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,592,"I want to know what it's like to serve with pride,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,593,to fight for someone I believe in.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,594,Do you believe in her?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,595,With all my heart.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,596,These are the ones?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,597,"Yes, Khaleesi. The officers."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,598,You did not choose this life.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,599,But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,600,Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,601,Remove your helmet.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,602,This one has the honour.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,603,What is your name?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,604,Grey Worm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,605,Grey Worm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,606,All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,607,"Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,608,Names that remind them what they are...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,609,Vermin.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,610,"From this day forward, you will choose your own names."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,611,You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,612,Throw away your slave name.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,613,"Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,614,A name that gives you pride.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,615,"""Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a lucky name."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,616,The name this one was born with was cursed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,617,That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,618,But Grey Worm is the name this one had
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,619,the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,620,King Robert wanted her dead.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,621,Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,622,I suppose no one on the Small Council could speak sense to him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,623,I didn't sit on the Small Council.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,624,No?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,625,Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,626,"Traditionally, yes,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,627,but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,628,He didn't want advice on how to govern
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,629,from a man who had fought for the Mad King.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,630,Can't say I minded much.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,631,I always hated the politics.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,632,"Yeah, I imagine I would, too."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,633,Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,634,Mmm-hmm.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,635,"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,636,if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,637,She'll have good men around her
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,638,"to advise her, men with experience."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,639,Which men do you have in mind?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,640,"Forgive me for what I'm about to say,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,641,but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,642,It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,643,I don't know if your presence by her side
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,644,will help our cause when we go home.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,645,Our cause?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,646,"Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the Khaleesi"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,647,against King Robert's assassins
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,648,while you were still bowing to the man.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,649,We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,650,You only joined us a few days ago.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,651,I can't speak to your intentions.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,652,"If we're truly her loyal servants,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,653,"we will do whatever needs to be done,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,654,"no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,655,You're not Lord Commander here. You're just another exile.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,656,And I take my orders from the Queen.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,657,Come to bed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,658,You were right.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,659,The Karstarks are gone.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,660,Almost half our forces.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,661,Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,662,Nothing.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,663,Only wait.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,664,Don't let him.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,665,What can I do? Attack King's Landing?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,666,There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,667,We could ride north.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,668,Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,669,Winter could last five years.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,670,"Once my bannermen are home again,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,671,"sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,672,"warm and safe, they'll never ride south again."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,673,"When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,674,Now we're like a band of bickering children.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,675,Give them a new purpose.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,676,What?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,677,I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,678,Here.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,679,And we're here.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,680,King's Landing...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,681,What is it?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,682,I can't force them to meet us in the field
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,683,"and I can't attack them where they're strongest,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,684,but I can attack them where they're not.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,685,And Casterly Rock can't run away.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,686,I'm going to take their home away from them.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,687,Can you do it?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,688,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,689,There is only one person in this kingdom
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,690,with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,691,The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,692,Walder Frey.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,693,He's such a splendid fighter.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,694,Do you have any idea when we might...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,695,I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,696,It should grow quickly.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,697,Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,698,And only one to let you go.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,699,Because it will please me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,700,Squire.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,701,"Well fought, ser."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,702,That was no fight.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,703,I don't know you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,704,"Olyver, if it please you."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,705,"I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,706,How did you know?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,707,Know what?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,708,That I wanted to.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,709,My lord...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,710,"I'll have you know I'm to be married soon,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,711,and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,712,"They rarely do, in my experience."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,713,"You have a good deal of experience, do you?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,714,With the husbands.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,715,That didn't take long.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,716,"Well, it took long enough."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,717,It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,718,Is he?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,719,And...
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,720,Who's the lucky girl?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,721,She may not be the grandest ship in the world
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,722,"or the fastest,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,723,but she's mine.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,724,I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,725,"Strange, isn't it?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,726,What is?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,727,"It doesn't matter what we want,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,728,"once we get it, then we want something else."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,729,Your hair is different.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,730,Is it?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,731,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,732,Many ladies wear it this way.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,733,I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,734,You still want me to come with you?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,735,It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,736,"You want to go home, don't you?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,737,Of course. More than anything.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,738,But maybe it would be better to wait.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,739,"I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,740,You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,741,I can't tell you how touched I am
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,742,by your concern for my welfare.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,743,"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,744,Your true friend.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,745,"I do, Lord Baelish."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,746,Petyr.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,747,Petyr.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,748,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,749,We'll speak again when I return.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,750,You're late.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,751,What's she doing here?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,752,"Our business concerns her, too."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,753,Sit.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,754,You'll be pleased to learn that
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,755,"after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,756,I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,757,Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,758,I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,759,Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,760,Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,761,are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,762,Very well. She's a lovely girl.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,763,"Missing some of Loras' favourite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,764,Your jokes are not appreciated.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,765,"It wasn't my best, but..."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,766,"I bring them into the royal fold, and this is how they repay me,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,767,by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,768,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,769,The Karstarks have marched home.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,770,The Young Wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,771,Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,772,"That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,773,and I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,774,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,775,Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,776,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,777,Plots are not public knowledge.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,778,And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,779,We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,780,And how do we do that?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,781,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,782,Wonderful.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,783,"Yes, it is."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,784,You can't mean it.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,785,I can and I do.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,786,Joffrey's made this poor girl's life miserable
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,787,since the day he took her father's head.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,788,"Now she's finally free of him, and you give her to me?"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,789,"That's cruel, even for you."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,790,Do you intend on mistreating her?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,791,"The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor yours."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,792,She's a child!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,793,"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,794,"There, you see? You will wed her,"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,795,"bed her, and put a child in her."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,796,Surely you're capable of that.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,797,And if I refuse?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,798,You wanted to be rewarded for your valour in battle.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,799,Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,800,And it is past time you were wed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,801,I was wed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,802,Or don't you remember?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,803,Only too well.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,804,You should be thanking the Gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,805,Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,806,What do you mean?
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,807,You'll marry Ser Loras.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,808,I will not.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,809,The boy is heir to Highgarden.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,810,"Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,811,"No, I won't do it."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,812,"Yes, you will."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,813,You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,814,"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,815,You're my daughter!
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,816,"You will do as I command, and you will marry Loras Tyrell"
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,817,and put an end to the disgusting rumours about you once and for all.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,818,"Father, don't make me do it again, please."
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,819,Not another word.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,820,My children.
S03E05,Kissed By Fire,821,You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
S03E06,The Climb,1,You've got too much wood in there.
S03E06,The Climb,2,"But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
S03E06,The Climb,3,It needs to breathe.
S03E06,The Climb,4,Take off that big log.
S03E06,The Climb,5,Ah.
S03E06,The Climb,6,You know your fires.
S03E06,The Climb,7,Someone built your fires for you growing up?
S03E06,The Climb,8,It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.
S03E06,The Climb,9,"And there were servants, of course."
S03E06,The Climb,10,I knew you were highborn.
S03E06,The Climb,11,"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men."
S03E06,The Climb,12,Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.
S03E06,The Climb,13,What does it do?
S03E06,The Climb,14,I'm not sure that it does anything.
S03E06,The Climb,15,"It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
S03E06,The Climb,16,How much longer?
S03E06,The Climb,17,Not so far. A few more days.
S03E06,The Climb,18,Is the Wall as big as they say?
S03E06,The Climb,19,Bigger.
S03E06,The Climb,20,So big you can't even see the top sometimes.
S03E06,The Climb,21,It's hidden in clouds.
S03E06,The Climb,22,You're playing with me.
S03E06,The Climb,23,I'm not.
S03E06,The Climb,24,"It's 700 feet high, all made of ice."
S03E06,The Climb,25,On a warm day you can see it weeping.
S03E06,The Climb,26,Castle Black is nice enough.
S03E06,The Climb,27,They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night.
S03E06,The Climb,28,And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.
S03E06,The Climb,29,Very tasty.
S03E06,The Climb,30,"Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing."
S03E06,The Climb,31,Dareon sings best.
S03E06,The Climb,32,- Do you sing? - No.
S03E06,The Climb,33,"No, no, no.  Not very well."
S03E06,The Climb,34,Sing me a song.
S03E06,The Climb,35,"Oh, all right. Let's see."
S03E06,The Climb,36,Oh.
S03E06,The Climb,37,The Father's face is stern and strong
S03E06,The Climb,38,He sits and judges right from wrong
S03E06,The Climb,39,"He weighs our lives, the short and long"
S03E06,The Climb,40,And loves the little children
S03E06,The Climb,41,The Mother gives the gift of life
S03E06,The Climb,42,And watches over every wife
S03E06,The Climb,43,Her gentle smile ends all strife
S03E06,The Climb,44,And she loves her little children
S03E06,The Climb,45,That's not how you skin a rabbit.
S03E06,The Climb,46,I know how to skin a rabbit.
S03E06,The Climb,47,Not by the looks of it.
S03E06,The Climb,48,"You grow up north of the Wall,"
S03E06,The Climb,49,you learn the proper way to handle game.
S03E06,The Climb,50,I didn't see any game before I got here.
S03E06,The Climb,51,"If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen."
S03E06,The Climb,52,"Well, I made this bow myself."
S03E06,The Climb,53,Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.
S03E06,The Climb,54,You learn how to use your fists.
S03E06,The Climb,55,"Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
S03E06,The Climb,56,I had someone else in mind.
S03E06,The Climb,57,"Well, someone else is sitting right here."
S03E06,The Climb,58,You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
S03E06,The Climb,59,Some of us are just a little better.
S03E06,The Climb,60,"Well, some of us would say thank you"
S03E06,The Climb,61,when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them.
S03E06,The Climb,62,Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
S03E06,The Climb,63,"You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
S03E06,The Climb,64,- Stop it! - Hmm.
S03E06,The Climb,65,- Hodor. - You've been fighting since you met.
S03E06,The Climb,66,Just stop it.
S03E06,The Climb,67,"Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass,"
S03E06,The Climb,68,it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.
S03E06,The Climb,69,You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
S03E06,The Climb,70,Me? It's my fault?
S03E06,The Climb,71,"First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
S03E06,The Climb,72,"First time I met you, you held a knife at me."
S03E06,The Climb,73,We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall.
S03E06,The Climb,74,I want you both to make peace.
S03E06,The Climb,75,Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker.
S03E06,The Climb,76,"I said so, didn't I?"
S03E06,The Climb,77,Osha!
S03E06,The Climb,78,You're a good little hunter.
S03E06,The Climb,79,"Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it?"
S03E06,The Climb,80,- Thank you. - Don't push me.
S03E06,The Climb,81,I'm right here with you.
S03E06,The Climb,82,What's happening?
S03E06,The Climb,83,I'm right here with you.
S03E06,The Climb,84,What's wrong with him?
S03E06,The Climb,85,The visions take their toll.
S03E06,The Climb,86,He's having one now?
S03E06,The Climb,87,I saw Jon Snow.
S03E06,The Climb,88,You saw him? At Castle Black?
S03E06,The Climb,89,"He was on the wrong side of the Wall,"
S03E06,The Climb,90,surrounded by enemies.
S03E06,The Climb,91,Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall.
S03E06,The Climb,92,Crows would come out every morning with axes.
S03E06,The Climb,93,Your flock gets smaller every year.
S03E06,The Climb,94,You ever climbed it before?
S03E06,The Climb,95,No.
S03E06,The Climb,96,But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.
S03E06,The Climb,97,You're afraid.
S03E06,The Climb,98,Aren't you?
S03E06,The Climb,99,Aye.
S03E06,The Climb,100,"Well, it's a long way up and a long way down."
S03E06,The Climb,101,But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there.
S03E06,The Climb,102,"Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you."
S03E06,The Climb,103,"They're too big for you, but they're good."
S03E06,The Climb,104,You kill someone for them?
S03E06,The Climb,105,Nah.
S03E06,The Climb,106,"I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
S03E06,The Climb,107,He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.
S03E06,The Climb,108,"Well, he didn't do that thing you do with your tongue."
S03E06,The Climb,109,Can we not talk about that here?
S03E06,The Climb,110,"""Can we not talk about that here?"
S03E06,The Climb,111,"""I'm Jon Snow."
S03E06,The Climb,112,"""I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand,"
S03E06,The Climb,113,"""but I'm scared of naked girls."""
S03E06,The Climb,114,Did I seem scared the other day?
S03E06,The Climb,115,You were trembling like a leaf.
S03E06,The Climb,116,Only in the beginning.
S03E06,The Climb,117,Huh.
S03E06,The Climb,118,Only in the beginning.
S03E06,The Climb,119,"You're a proper lover, Jon Snow."
S03E06,The Climb,120,And don't worry.
S03E06,The Climb,121,Your secret's safe with me.
S03E06,The Climb,122,What secret?
S03E06,The Climb,123,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls
S03E06,The Climb,124,in silk dresses you knew growing up?
S03E06,The Climb,125,You're loyal and you're brave.
S03E06,The Climb,126,You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
S03E06,The Climb,127,"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow."
S03E06,The Climb,128,You're going to be loyal to your woman.
S03E06,The Climb,129,The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.
S03E06,The Climb,130,Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.
S03E06,The Climb,131,We're just soldiers and there's more to carry on if we go down.
S03E06,The Climb,132,It's you and me that matters to me and you.
S03E06,The Climb,133,Don't ever betray me.
S03E06,The Climb,134,I won't.
S03E06,The Climb,135,'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round me neck.
S03E06,The Climb,136,Sink your metal deep
S03E06,The Climb,137,and make sure it holds before taking your next step.
S03E06,The Climb,138,"And if you fall, don't scream."
S03E06,The Climb,139,You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.
S03E06,The Climb,140,Joffrey.
S03E06,The Climb,141,Cersei.
S03E06,The Climb,142,Ilyn Payne.
S03E06,The Climb,143,You're good.
S03E06,The Climb,144,You're not as good as you think you are.
S03E06,The Climb,145,"Face, tits, balls..."
S03E06,The Climb,146,I hit 'em right where I wanted to.
S03E06,The Climb,147,"Aye,"
S03E06,The Climb,148,but you took your sweet time of it.
S03E06,The Climb,149,"You won't be fighting straw men, little lady."
S03E06,The Climb,150,Show me your position.
S03E06,The Climb,151,Keep your elbow high.
S03E06,The Climb,152,You want your back doing the hard labour.
S03E06,The Climb,153,You're holding.
S03E06,The Climb,154,Never hold.
S03E06,The Climb,155,What?
S03E06,The Climb,156,Your muscles tense up when you hold.
S03E06,The Climb,157,Pull the string back to the centre of your chin and release.
S03E06,The Climb,158,Never hold.
S03E06,The Climb,159,But I have to aim.
S03E06,The Climb,160,Never aim.
S03E06,The Climb,161,Never aim?
S03E06,The Climb,162,Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go.
S03E06,The Climb,163,Trust your eye.
S03E06,The Climb,164,There's someone out there.
S03E06,The Climb,165,That's about far enough.
S03E06,The Climb,166,We come as friends.
S03E06,The Climb,167,"Begging your pardon, m'lady,"
S03E06,The Climb,168,but we'll be the judge of that.
S03E06,The Climb,169,Valar Morghulis.
S03E06,The Climb,170,Valar Dohaeris.
S03E06,The Climb,171,I don't see many priestesses of R'hllor in the Riverlands.
S03E06,The Climb,172,You are Thoros of Myr.
S03E06,The Climb,173,The High Priest gave you a mission.
S03E06,The Climb,174,Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light.
S03E06,The Climb,175,What happened?
S03E06,The Climb,176,I failed.
S03E06,The Climb,177,"You quit, you mean."
S03E06,The Climb,178,The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.
S03E06,The Climb,179,"You worship Him your way, and I'll worship Him mine."
S03E06,The Climb,180,Do you speak the Common tongue?
S03E06,The Climb,181,My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.
S03E06,The Climb,182,"Why are you here, my lady?"
S03E06,The Climb,183,Forgive my manners.
S03E06,The Climb,184,I don't see many ladies these days.
S03E06,The Climb,185,Lucky for the ladies.
S03E06,The Climb,186,How many times has the Lord brought him back?
S03E06,The Climb,187,Six.
S03E06,The Climb,188,That's not possible.
S03E06,The Climb,189,The Lord has smiled upon me.
S03E06,The Climb,190,You should not have this power.
S03E06,The Climb,191,I have no power.
S03E06,The Climb,192,"I ask the Lord for His favour,"
S03E06,The Climb,193,and He responds as He will.
S03E06,The Climb,194,I've always been a terrible priest.
S03E06,The Climb,195,Drank too much rum.
S03E06,The Climb,196,Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.
S03E06,The Climb,197,"It's a terrible thing to say,"
S03E06,The Climb,198,"but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord."
S03E06,The Climb,199,"I decided that He, that all the Gods,"
S03E06,The Climb,200,were stories we told the children to make them behave.
S03E06,The Climb,201,"So I wore the robes, and every now and then I'd recite the prayers,"
S03E06,The Climb,202,but it was just for show.
S03E06,The Climb,203,A spectacle for the locals.
S03E06,The Climb,204,Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart.
S03E06,The Climb,205,I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words.
S03E06,The Climb,206,"Not because I believed in them, but..."
S03E06,The Climb,207,He was my friend and he was dead.
S03E06,The Climb,208,And they were the only words I knew.
S03E06,The Climb,209,"And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied."
S03E06,The Climb,210,"Beric's eyes opened, and I knew the truth."
S03E06,The Climb,211,Our god is the one true god.
S03E06,The Climb,212,And all men must serve Him.
S03E06,The Climb,213,You've been to the other side.
S03E06,The Climb,214,The other side?
S03E06,The Climb,215,There is no other side.
S03E06,The Climb,216,"I have been to the darkness, my lady."
S03E06,The Climb,217,He sent you to us for a reason.
S03E06,The Climb,218,You have someone He needs.
S03E06,The Climb,219,Bodkin point.
S03E06,The Climb,220,Penetrates plate at 200 yards.
S03E06,The Climb,221,Can you make 'em?
S03E06,The Climb,222,"Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
S03E06,The Climb,223,I'll get you the steel.
S03E06,The Climb,224,Come on.
S03E06,The Climb,225,I don't like that woman.
S03E06,The Climb,226,That's 'cause you're a girl.
S03E06,The Climb,227,What does that have to do with anything?
S03E06,The Climb,228,"Forgive me, lad."
S03E06,The Climb,229,What are you doing? Let go of him.
S03E06,The Climb,230,- Tell them to stop. - Come on.
S03E06,The Climb,231,He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
S03E06,The Climb,232,"We serve the Lord of Light, and the Lord of Light needs this boy."
S03E06,The Climb,233,"Did the Lord of Light tell you that, or did she?"
S03E06,The Climb,234,You're not doing this for your god.
S03E06,The Climb,235,You're doing it for gold.
S03E06,The Climb,236,"We're doing it for both, girl."
S03E06,The Climb,237,We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food.
S03E06,The Climb,238,And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.
S03E06,The Climb,239,You told me this was a Brotherhood.
S03E06,The Climb,240,You told me I could be one of you.
S03E06,The Climb,241,You are more than they can ever be.
S03E06,The Climb,242,They're just foot soldiers in the great war.
S03E06,The Climb,243,You will make kings rise and fall.
S03E06,The Climb,244,You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
S03E06,The Climb,245,I see a darkness in you.
S03E06,The Climb,246,"And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me..."
S03E06,The Climb,247,"Brown eyes,"
S03E06,The Climb,248,"blue eyes, green eyes."
S03E06,The Climb,249,Eyes you'll shut forever.
S03E06,The Climb,250,We will meet again.
S03E06,The Climb,251,"You staring at me ass, Jon Snow?"
S03E06,The Climb,252,Look out!
S03E06,The Climb,253,You all right?
S03E06,The Climb,254,"Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
S03E06,The Climb,255,Sorry. Were you sleeping?
S03E06,The Climb,256,Wa...
S03E06,The Climb,257,Wa... Wa...
S03E06,The Climb,258,Water? You want some water.
S03E06,The Climb,259,I wish I had some for you.
S03E06,The Climb,260,"So, let's play a game."
S03E06,The Climb,261,Which body part do you need the least?
S03E06,The Climb,262,Please.
S03E06,The Climb,263,"""Please"" is not a body part."
S03E06,The Climb,264,"I'll tell you everything, please."
S03E06,The Climb,265,But you've already told me everything.
S03E06,The Climb,266,Remember?
S03E06,The Climb,267,Your daddy was mean to you.
S03E06,The Climb,268,The Starks didn't appreciate you.
S03E06,The Climb,269,"One good bit, though."
S03E06,The Climb,270,"The Stark boys, they're still alive."
S03E06,The Climb,271,Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?
S03E06,The Climb,272,"You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
S03E06,The Climb,273,Now...
S03E06,The Climb,274,"How about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you?"
S03E06,The Climb,275,No? Good. Let's start with that.
S03E06,The Climb,276,Ah!
S03E06,The Climb,277,"You've been wondering why you're here, haven't you?"
S03E06,The Climb,278,Where you are.
S03E06,The Climb,279,Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you.
S03E06,The Climb,280,"So, guess."
S03E06,The Climb,281,"If you guess right, I'll tell you."
S03E06,The Climb,282,"By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it."
S03E06,The Climb,283,You win the game
S03E06,The Climb,284,"if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you,"
S03E06,The Climb,285,and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
S03E06,The Climb,286,"If I win, you'll let me go?"
S03E06,The Climb,287,"If you think this has a happy ending,"
S03E06,The Climb,288,you haven't been paying attention.
S03E06,The Climb,289,Please.
S03E06,The Climb,290,"You say ""please"" again and you'll wish you hadn't."
S03E06,The Climb,291,You first. Where are we?
S03E06,The Climb,292,The North.
S03E06,The Climb,293,Too vague.
S03E06,The Climb,294,Deepwood Motte.
S03E06,The Climb,295,Terrible guess.
S03E06,The Climb,296,"Now, where?"
S03E06,The Climb,297,Last Hearth.
S03E06,The Climb,298,Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
S03E06,The Climb,299,Karhold!
S03E06,The Climb,300,Karhold?
S03E06,The Climb,301,How did you know that?
S03E06,The Climb,302,Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
S03E06,The Climb,303,No.
S03E06,The Climb,304,It was just a guess.
S03E06,The Climb,305,"Very good, Lord Theon."
S03E06,The Climb,306,And who am I?
S03E06,The Climb,307,Torrhen Karstark.
S03E06,The Climb,308,He's dead.
S03E06,The Climb,309,Strangled by the Kingslayer.
S03E06,The Climb,310,He was your brother.
S03E06,The Climb,311,Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
S03E06,The Climb,312,You swore to tell me if I...
S03E06,The Climb,313,You're right.
S03E06,The Climb,314,Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman.
S03E06,The Climb,315,I betrayed Robb.
S03E06,The Climb,316,That's why you're torturing me.
S03E06,The Climb,317,Yes.
S03E06,The Climb,318,You win.
S03E06,The Climb,319,"Of course, you forgot to ask one question."
S03E06,The Climb,320,You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.
S03E06,The Climb,321,I'm afraid I am.
S03E06,The Climb,322,Everything I told you is a lie.
S03E06,The Climb,323,This isn't happening to you for a reason.
S03E06,The Climb,324,"But, well, one reason..."
S03E06,The Climb,325,I enjoy it.
S03E06,The Climb,326,"Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
S03E06,The Climb,327,I win.
S03E06,The Climb,328,Thank you for riding here so quickly.
S03E06,The Climb,329,I know travel isn't easy in these times.
S03E06,The Climb,330,The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.
S03E06,The Climb,331,"When the King of the North summons us, we come."
S03E06,The Climb,332,Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance
S03E06,The Climb,333,with the North can continue if his terms are met.
S03E06,The Climb,334,Lord Frey requires a formal apology
S03E06,The Climb,335,for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
S03E06,The Climb,336,Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
S03E06,The Climb,337,"As restitution for this betrayal,"
S03E06,The Climb,338,he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
S03E06,The Climb,339,I don't think that's...
S03E06,The Climb,340,We are fighting for the North.
S03E06,The Climb,341,Harrenhal is not in the North.
S03E06,The Climb,342,It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
S03E06,The Climb,343,And there's something else.
S03E06,The Climb,344,We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
S03E06,The Climb,345,"Not what, whom."
S03E06,The Climb,346,What?
S03E06,The Climb,347,"Uh, no."
S03E06,The Climb,348,Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters. Roslin.
S03E06,The Climb,349,How old is she?
S03E06,The Climb,350,Nineteen.
S03E06,The Climb,351,Could I see her first?
S03E06,The Climb,352,You want to count her teeth?
S03E06,The Climb,353,We depart for the Twins in the morning.
S03E06,The Climb,354,"We need an answer before we leave,"
S03E06,The Climb,355,and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter
S03E06,The Climb,356,or this alliance is at an end.
S03E06,The Climb,357,Your father does realise we're in the middle of a war?
S03E06,The Climb,358,Father is old.
S03E06,The Climb,359,It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
S03E06,The Climb,360,And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
S03E06,The Climb,361,He has every right to be.
S03E06,The Climb,362,Please excuse us while we discuss it.
S03E06,The Climb,363,Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?
S03E06,The Climb,364,"At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were."
S03E06,The Climb,365,I'm his liege lord.
S03E06,The Climb,366,He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
S03E06,The Climb,367,I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
S03E06,The Climb,368,Listen to me and listen very carefully. You...
S03E06,The Climb,369,The laws of gods and men are very clear.
S03E06,The Climb,370,No man can compel another man to marry.
S03E06,The Climb,371,The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
S03E06,The Climb,372,It's all right. You heard him.
S03E06,The Climb,373,"If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
S03E06,The Climb,374,He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12.
S03E06,The Climb,375,He's not gonna stop wanting it now.
S03E06,The Climb,376,"When I say no, he will come back"
S03E06,The Climb,377,and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
S03E06,The Climb,378,You're willing to risk our freedom
S03E06,The Climb,379,and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
S03E06,The Climb,380,I have a war to fight.
S03E06,The Climb,381,We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle.
S03E06,The Climb,382,You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
S03E06,The Climb,383,You recall that heroic engagement?
S03E06,The Climb,384,I had something less permanent in mind.
S03E06,The Climb,385,"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war."
S03E06,The Climb,386,"If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
S03E06,The Climb,387,I'll marry her.
S03E06,The Climb,388,"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right."
S03E06,The Climb,389,I'll remember it.
S03E06,The Climb,390,I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
S03E06,The Climb,391,Yes. Most kind of them.
S03E06,The Climb,392,"You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton."
S03E06,The Climb,393,I am acting on Lady Stark's orders
S03E06,The Climb,394,to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.
S03E06,The Climb,395,"When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner."
S03E06,The Climb,396,"If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
S03E06,The Climb,397,I should send you back to Robb Stark.
S03E06,The Climb,398,You should.
S03E06,The Climb,399,"But instead, you're sitting here, watching me fail at dinner."
S03E06,The Climb,400,Why might that be?
S03E06,The Climb,401,Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
S03E06,The Climb,402,We both know who would pay the most.
S03E06,The Climb,403,Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me
S03E06,The Climb,404,and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
S03E06,The Climb,405,You're right.
S03E06,The Climb,406,Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
S03E06,The Climb,407,"It would be,"
S03E06,The Climb,408,if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
S03E06,The Climb,409,King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.
S03E06,The Climb,410,He doesn't have time for anything else.
S03E06,The Climb,411,He'll make time for you.
S03E06,The Climb,412,"As soon as you're well enough to travel,"
S03E06,The Climb,413,I will allow you to go to King's Landing
S03E06,The Climb,414,as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.
S03E06,The Climb,415,"And you will swear to tell your father the truth,"
S03E06,The Climb,416,that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
S03E06,The Climb,417,Shall we drink on it?
S03E06,The Climb,418,I don't partake.
S03E06,The Climb,419,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
S03E06,The Climb,420,Very well.
S03E06,The Climb,421,"My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
S03E06,The Climb,422,"Oh, she won't be going with you."
S03E06,The Climb,423,I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to...
S03E06,The Climb,424,You are charged with abetting treason.
S03E06,The Climb,425,I'm afraid I must insist.
S03E06,The Climb,426,You're in no place to insist on anything.
S03E06,The Climb,427,I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson
S03E06,The Climb,428,about overplaying your position.
S03E06,The Climb,429,- Impossible. - Why?
S03E06,The Climb,430,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.
S03E06,The Climb,431,The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.
S03E06,The Climb,432,"- Your daughter... - Is rich,"
S03E06,The Climb,433,"the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms,"
S03E06,The Climb,434,and the mother of the King.
S03E06,The Climb,435,Old.
S03E06,The Climb,436,Old?
S03E06,The Climb,437,Old.
S03E06,The Climb,438,I'm something of an expert on the subject.
S03E06,The Climb,439,Her change will be upon her before long.
S03E06,The Climb,440,I'll spare you the details of what will happen then.
S03E06,The Climb,441,"You may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter,"
S03E06,The Climb,442,but this is another matter entirely.
S03E06,The Climb,443,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that."
S03E06,The Climb,444,"My stomach remains quite strong, however."
S03E06,The Climb,445,The only thing that might turn it are details
S03E06,The Climb,446,of your grandson's nocturnal activities.
S03E06,The Climb,447,Do you deny them?
S03E06,The Climb,448,"Oh, not at all."
S03E06,The Climb,449,A sword-swallower through and through.
S03E06,The Climb,450,A boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity
S03E06,The Climb,451,to marry the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms
S03E06,The Climb,452,and remove the stain from his name.
S03E06,The Climb,453,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?"
S03E06,The Climb,454,"Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
S03E06,The Climb,455,Of course.
S03E06,The Climb,456,And you never...
S03E06,The Climb,457,No.
S03E06,The Climb,458,Not once? Not in any way?
S03E06,The Climb,459,Never.
S03E06,The Climb,460,I congratulate you upon your restraint.
S03E06,The Climb,461,"But it's natural, boys having a go beneath the sheets."
S03E06,The Climb,462,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behaviour.
S03E06,The Climb,463,I wouldn't say that.
S03E06,The Climb,464,"True, we don't tie ourselves in knots"
S03E06,The Climb,465,"over a discreet bit of buggery, but"
S03E06,The Climb,466,brothers and sisters...
S03E06,The Climb,467,"Where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
S03E06,The Climb,468,I will not breathe further life
S03E06,The Climb,469,into a malicious lie by discussing it.
S03E06,The Climb,470,"Lie or not,"
S03E06,The Climb,471,you must admit many people find it quite convincing.
S03E06,The Climb,472,Convincing enough to put swords in their hands
S03E06,The Climb,473,"and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells,"
S03E06,The Climb,474,thanks to our new affiliation.
S03E06,The Climb,475,I don't care what people believe.
S03E06,The Climb,476,And neither do you.
S03E06,The Climb,477,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
S03E06,The Climb,478,"Now, if the rumours about my children were true,"
S03E06,The Climb,479,"then Joffrey is no king at all,"
S03E06,The Climb,480,and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
S03E06,The Climb,481,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,"
S03E06,The Climb,482,we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.
S03E06,The Climb,483,It is a chance we simply cannot take.
S03E06,The Climb,484,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?
S03E06,The Climb,485,All right.
S03E06,The Climb,486,I'll remove it for you.
S03E06,The Climb,487,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,"
S03E06,The Climb,488,I will name him to the Kingsguard.
S03E06,The Climb,489,I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows.
S03E06,The Climb,490,He will never marry. He will never have children.
S03E06,The Climb,491,Ah.
S03E06,The Climb,492,The Tyrell name will fade.
S03E06,The Climb,493,And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
S03E06,The Climb,494,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
S03E06,The Climb,495,I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior
S03E06,The Climb,496,who takes his vows seriously.
S03E06,The Climb,497,"So, shall I draw up the order?"
S03E06,The Climb,498,Or do you consent to this match?
S03E06,The Climb,499,"It's a rare enough thing, a man who lives up to his reputation."
S03E06,The Climb,500,No!
S03E06,The Climb,501,We've gotta cut them loose!
S03E06,The Climb,502,No!
S03E06,The Climb,503,Take my hand!
S03E06,The Climb,504,That's a wonderful pin.
S03E06,The Climb,505,"It's more of a brooch, really."
S03E06,The Climb,506,"Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so..."
S03E06,The Climb,507,I'm very happy about...
S03E06,The Climb,508,Yes. I am as well.
S03E06,The Climb,509,I feel like I'm in a dream.
S03E06,The Climb,510,"Yes, me, too. Definitely."
S03E06,The Climb,511,I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was young.
S03E06,The Climb,512,"The guests, the food, the tournaments."
S03E06,The Climb,513,"And the bride, of course."
S03E06,The Climb,514,The most beautiful bride in the world
S03E06,The Climb,515,in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.
S03E06,The Climb,516,"Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
S03E06,The Climb,517,No. I had never left Winterfell
S03E06,The Climb,518,before I came to King's Landing.
S03E06,The Climb,519,But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it.
S03E06,The Climb,520,And to leave this place.
S03E06,The Climb,521,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
S03E06,The Climb,522,The most terrible place there is.
S03E06,The Climb,523,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
S03E06,The Climb,524,We can have them both killed.
S03E06,The Climb,525,It's hard to say which of the four of us
S03E06,The Climb,526,is getting the worst of this arrangement.
S03E06,The Climb,527,Probably Sansa.
S03E06,The Climb,528,Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
S03E06,The Climb,529,Father doesn't discriminate.
S03E06,The Climb,530,We're all being shipped off to hell together.
S03E06,The Climb,531,On a boat you built.
S03E06,The Climb,532,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.
S03E06,The Climb,533,I did what I did to protect our family.
S03E06,The Climb,534,I'm your family.
S03E06,The Climb,535,A member of your family who has actively
S03E06,The Climb,536,contributed to that family's survival.
S03E06,The Climb,537,Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
S03E06,The Climb,538,I do admit it.
S03E06,The Climb,539,"If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,"
S03E06,The Climb,540,Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.
S03E06,The Climb,541,Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
S03E06,The Climb,542,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.
S03E06,The Climb,543,There are two people in King's Landing
S03E06,The Climb,544,who can give an order to a Kingsguard.
S03E06,The Climb,545,Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon
S03E06,The Climb,546,to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
S03E06,The Climb,547,The impulse I understand.
S03E06,The Climb,548,He hates me because I'm the only one
S03E06,The Climb,549,who tells him what he really is.
S03E06,The Climb,550,"So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity?"
S03E06,The Climb,551,He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.
S03E06,The Climb,552,But the King orders a Kingsguard
S03E06,The Climb,553,to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army.
S03E06,The Climb,554,The boy's an idiot.
S03E06,The Climb,555,What do you want me to say?
S03E06,The Climb,556,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
S03E06,The Climb,557,Probably.
S03E06,The Climb,558,But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
S03E06,The Climb,559,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
S03E06,The Climb,560,Not the Tyrells.
S03E06,The Climb,561,Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.
S03E06,The Climb,562,"Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore,"
S03E06,The Climb,563,and so will his children and their children.
S03E06,The Climb,564,History will be taken from our hands.
S03E06,The Climb,565,"You may escape, at least."
S03E06,The Climb,566,"Once Jaime gets back,"
S03E06,The Climb,567,Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
S03E06,The Climb,568,"When Jaime gets back, yes."
S03E06,The Climb,569,But when will that be? He's out there somewhere.
S03E06,The Climb,570,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
S03E06,The Climb,571,Who's going to tell her?
S03E06,The Climb,572,Do you think people will like it?
S03E06,The Climb,573,I don't think they will even notice it.
S03E06,The Climb,574,You're right. It's not my wedding.
S03E06,The Climb,575,"Anyway, from what I can tell,"
S03E06,The Climb,576,the dressmakers in Highgarden will be
S03E06,The Climb,577,far superior to the ones in King's Landing.
S03E06,The Climb,578,They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.
S03E06,The Climb,579,Loras likes green and gold brocade.
S03E06,The Climb,580,I'm sure he does.
S03E06,The Climb,581,Will they let me invite my family?
S03E06,The Climb,582,They haven't asked my opinion.
S03E06,The Climb,583,But do you think they will?
S03E06,The Climb,584,No.
S03E06,The Climb,585,"Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you."
S03E06,The Climb,586,Should I...
S03E06,The Climb,587,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
S03E06,The Climb,588,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was trying on a gown for Joffrey's wedding."
S03E06,The Climb,589,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding."
S03E06,The Climb,590,"I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
S03E06,The Climb,591,Of course.
S03E06,The Climb,592,"Alone, if I may."
S03E06,The Climb,593,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
S03E06,The Climb,594,Shae.
S03E06,The Climb,595,Please excuse her. She's not from here.
S03E06,The Climb,596,"But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
S03E06,The Climb,597,"Sometimes we think we want to hear something,"
S03E06,The Climb,598,"and it's only afterwards, when it's too late,"
S03E06,The Climb,599,that we realise we wished we'd heard it
S03E06,The Climb,600,under entirely different circumstances.
S03E06,The Climb,601,"It's all right, really."
S03E06,The Climb,602,How to begin?
S03E06,The Climb,603,It's... This...
S03E06,The Climb,604,This... This is awkward.
S03E06,The Climb,605,A thousand blades
S03E06,The Climb,606,"taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies,"
S03E06,The Climb,607,forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
S03E06,The Climb,608,"There aren't 1,000 blades."
S03E06,The Climb,609,There aren't even 200.
S03E06,The Climb,610,I've counted.
S03E06,The Climb,611,I'm sure you have.
S03E06,The Climb,612,Ugly old thing.
S03E06,The Climb,613,Yet it has a certain appeal.
S03E06,The Climb,614,The Lysa Arryn of chairs.
S03E06,The Climb,615,Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
S03E06,The Climb,616,"Early days, my friend."
S03E06,The Climb,617,"It is flattering, really,"
S03E06,The Climb,618,you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
S03E06,The Climb,619,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you."
S03E06,The Climb,620,Although who doesn't like to see
S03E06,The Climb,621,their friends fail now and then?
S03E06,The Climb,622,You're so right.
S03E06,The Climb,623,"For instance, when I thwarted your plan"
S03E06,The Climb,624,to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.
S03E06,The Climb,625,"If I'm going to be honest,"
S03E06,The Climb,626,I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there.
S03E06,The Climb,627,"But your confidant,"
S03E06,The Climb,628,"the one who fed you information about my plans,"
S03E06,The Climb,629,the one you swore to protect...
S03E06,The Climb,630,You didn't bring her any enjoyment.
S03E06,The Climb,631,And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.
S03E06,The Climb,632,She was a bad investment on my part.
S03E06,The Climb,633,"Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new."
S03E06,The Climb,634,Something daring.
S03E06,The Climb,635,And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
S03E06,The Climb,636,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
S03E06,The Climb,637,The realm?
S03E06,The Climb,638,Do you know what the realm is?
S03E06,The Climb,639,"It's the 1,000 blades of Aegon's enemies."
S03E06,The Climb,640,"A story we agree to tell each other over and over,"
S03E06,The Climb,641,till we forget that it's a lie.
S03E06,The Climb,642,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?
S03E06,The Climb,643,Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
S03E06,The Climb,644,Chaos isn't a pit.
S03E06,The Climb,645,Chaos is a ladder.
S03E06,The Climb,646,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.
S03E06,The Climb,647,The fall breaks them.
S03E06,The Climb,648,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse."
S03E06,The Climb,649,They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.
S03E06,The Climb,650,Illusions.
S03E06,The Climb,651,Only the ladder is real.
S03E06,The Climb,652,The climb is all there is.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,1,How far are we?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,2,"About a week, I think."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,3,You think?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,4,You don't know?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,5,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the King's Road."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,6,You and your roads.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,7,Is that how you lot do your fighting?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,8,You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,9,"Most of the time, yes."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,10,How do the men holding the banners fight?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,11,"They don't, really."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,12,It's a great honour to carry your house sigil.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,13,"And the drummers... Is that a great honour, too?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,14,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,15,"So, what good are they?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,16,They help the men march.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,17,How?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,18,"Well, it's..."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,19,It's the rhythm.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,20,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,21,"right foot, left foot, right foot?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,22,"What, you need help remembering that?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,23,"When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,24,we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,25,No.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,26,"No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,27,the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,28,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,29,"She's right, you don't."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,30,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,31,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,32,That's because she understands the way things are.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,33,"And are you gonna share it with me,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,34,the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,35,People work together when it suits them.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,36,They're loyal when it suits them.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,37,They love each other when it suits them.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,38,And they kill each other when it suits them.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,39,"She knows that, you don't."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,40,Which is why you'll never hold on to her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,41,That rain will cost us another day.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,42,Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,43,Lord Walder is prickly by nature. If...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,44,"""Prickly""? That what you call it?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,45,Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,46,"Yes, and that is why..."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,47,I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,48,"Apologies, Your Grace."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,49,I've spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,50,"I've spent two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,51,I'm not afraid of wet shits.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,52,Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,53,He can take it as he likes.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,54,He's getting the wedding he wanted.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,55,He's getting a wedding.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,56,It was a king he wanted.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,57,Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,58,We should all get some sleep.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,59,"If you don't put some clothes on,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,60,I can't promise I won't attack you again.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,61,Attack. Attack.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,62,Who are you writing?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,63,My mother.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,64,Is that Valyrian?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,65,Gaaa.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,66,"""Gaaa""?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,67,Say hello for me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,68,Rytsas.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,69,"""Ritsas."""
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,70,That was close enough.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,71,Does she know her daughter's a queen?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,72,Not yet.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,73,"That will be a surprise, I expect."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,74,Many surprises for her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,75,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,76,"when you're over there, looking like that?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,77,Will you come with me one day to Volantis?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,78,When all this is over?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,79,I will.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,80,I promise.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,81,I know she'd love to meet you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,82,And her grandchild.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,83,"What, now?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,84,Are you certain?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,85,Are you angry with me?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,86,Angry?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,87,You're my queen.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,88,And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,89,Maybe one of each.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,90,Don't get greedy.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,91,Can you leave the war for one night?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,92,I love you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,93,Do you hear me?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,94,I love you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,95,Most men fuck like dogs.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,96,"No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts, and done."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,97,You need to be patient. Give her time.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,98,Your cock shouldn't go near her
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,99,till she's slick as a baby seal.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,100,"And then you go inside, but slowly."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,101,Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,102,Come on!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,103,"Hey, come on."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,104,"You think he loves you, is that it?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,105,What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,106,and live with you in some castle?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,107,"No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,108,"I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,109,"What, you're jealous?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,110,Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,111,And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,112,You would if you were mine.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,113,I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,114,I'd be good to you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,115,You love him?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,116,'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,117,You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,118,You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,119,Don't touch me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,120,You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,121,"Growing up at Winterfell,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,122,"all I ever wanted was to escape,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,123,to come here to the capital.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,124,See the southern knights and their painted armour
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,125,and King's Landing after dark.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,126,All the candles burning in all those windows.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,127,I'm stupid.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,128,A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,129,Come on.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,130,Come walk with me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,131,I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,132,I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,133,"I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,134,"You would have been happy at Highgarden,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,135,but women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,136,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,137,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,138,No.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,139,Has he been kind to you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,140,He's tried.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,141,"You don't want him, though."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,142,He's a Lannister.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,143,"Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,144,I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,145,My son will be king.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,146,Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,147,"And your son, if I'm not mistaken,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,148,your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,149,What?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,150,My son...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,151,With him.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,152,I'll have to...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,153,We'll have to...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,154,If it's the pain you're worried about...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,155,I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,156,"What is it, then?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,157,"He's rather good-looking, even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,158,He's a dwarf.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,159,And Loras...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,160,Loras.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,161,Some women like tall men. Some like short men.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,162,Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,163,"Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,164,Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,165,"And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and grey."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,166,"Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,167,And that's a good thing?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,168,It can be.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,169,"We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,170,How do you know all this?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,171,Did your mother teach you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,172,"Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,173,She's a child.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,174,She's a foot taller than you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,175,A tall child.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,176,What's the youngest you've ever had?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,177,Not that young.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,178,How much older?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,179,Older.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,180,"You're a lord, she's a lady."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,181,"And a beauty, at that. I don't see the problem."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,182,Shae isn't going to like it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,183,Shae is a whore.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,184,"Are you gonna marry her, eh?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,185,How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,186,I should never have told you about that.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,187,"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,188,All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,189,He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,190,You can rule the North in his name.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,191,You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,192,Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,193,"You waste time trying to get people to love you,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,194,you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,195,You want to fuck that Stark girl.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,196,You just don't want to admit it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,197,I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,198,The ones already there don't need company.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,199,You pay me to kill people who bother you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,200,Evil notions come free.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,201,Your Grace.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,202,Grandfather.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,203,You wanted to speak to me?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,204,Yes.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,205,I'd like a report on the meetings of my Small Council.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,206,You're welcome to attend the meetings
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,207,"of your Small Council, Your Grace."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,208,Any or all of them.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,209,I've been very busy.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,210,Many important matters require a king's attention.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,211,Of course.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,212,You've been holding the council meetings
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,213,in the Tower of the Hand instead of the Small Council chamber.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,214,"I have, yes."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,215,May I ask why?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,216,"Well, the Tower of the Hand is where I work."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,217,"To walk from there to here would take time,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,218,time I could otherwise spend productively.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,219,"So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,220,I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,221,We could arrange to have you carried.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,222,Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,223,Where did you hear about this?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,224,Is it true?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,225,Apparently so.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,226,Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,227,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,228,the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,229,The skull of the last of them was right here.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,230,It was the size of an apple.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,231,And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,232,"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,233,Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,234,But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,235,and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,236,Because we have been told as much by the many experts
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,237,who serve the realm by counselling the King
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,238,on matters about which he knows nothing.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,239,But I haven't been counselled.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,240,You are being counselled at this very moment.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,241,I should be consulted about such things.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,242,"From now on, I will see to it that you are"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,243,appropriately consulted on important matters
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,244,whenever necessary.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,245,Your Grace.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,246,Yunkai. The Yellow City.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,247,"The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,248,"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,249,"They have provisions, patience, and strong walls."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,250,"If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,251,"and chip away at us, man by man."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,252,I don't want half my army killed
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,253,before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,254,"We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,255,Taking this city will not bring you
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,256,any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,257,How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,258,"200,000, if not more."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,259,"Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,260,Send a man to the city gates.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,261,"Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,262,"Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,263,Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,264,"of that ancient and honourable house,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,265,"Master of Men and Speaker to Savages, to offer terms of peace."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,266,"Noble lord, you are in the presence"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,267,"of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,268,"Queen of the Andals and the First Men,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,269,"Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,270,"Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,271,You may approach. Sit.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,272,Will the noble lord take refreshment?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,273,Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,274,Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,275,Many an army has broken against our walls.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,276,"You shall find no easy conquest here, Khaleesi."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,277,Good.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,278,My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,279,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,280,But why?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,281,"'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,282,but the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,283,The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the Silver Queen.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,284,There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,285,"- My ship? - Yes, Khaleesi."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,286,"As I said, we are a generous people."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,287,You shall have as many ships as you require.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,288,And what do you ask in return?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,289,All we ask is that you make use of these ships.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,290,"Sail them back to Westeros where you belong,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,291,and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,292,I have a gift for you as well.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,293,Your life.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,294,My life?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,295,And the lives of your wise masters.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,296,But I also want something in return.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,297,You will release every slave in Yunkai.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,298,"Every man, woman, and child"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,299,"shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,300,as payment for their years of servitude.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,301,"Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,302,You are mad.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,303,"We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai, and we have powerful friends."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,304,Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,305,"Those who survive, we shall enslave once more."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,306,Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,307,"- You swore me safe conduct. - I did,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,308,but my dragons made no promises.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,309,And you threatened their mother.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,310,Take the gold.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,311,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,312,And I shall put it to good use.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,313,You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,314,Now get out.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,315,The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,316,And what happens to things that don't bend?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,317,He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,318,I don't know.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,319,Find out.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,320,Chains?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,321,Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,322,Smithed in Casterly Rock.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,323,Golden chains.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,324,You could buy a ship with these.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,325,- Do I need a ship? - What?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,326,Am I going somewhere?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,327,Of course you're not going anywhere.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,328,"So, am I invited to your wedding?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,329,I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,330,No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,331,That doesn't mean that...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,332,"This is duty, not desire."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,333,Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,334,I don't have a choice. My father...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,335,Does not rule the world.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,336,We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,337,What would I do there?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,338,Juggle?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,339,I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,340,And I'm Shae the funny whore.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,341,My feelings for you have not changed.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,342,I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,343,While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,344,"I swear to you, it will not be like that."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,345,No? What will it be like?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,346,I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,347,"You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,348,Any children we might have will be well provided for.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,349,Children? You think I want children
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,350,who can never see their father?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,351,Who would be killed in their sleep
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,352,if their grandfather found out about them?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,353,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,354,I'm not your lady.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,355,You are.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,356,You'll always be my lady.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,357,I'm your whore.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,358,"And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,359,- What happened? - Wildfire.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,360,I should have been here.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,361,"After all the running and fighting,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,362,"here I am, back where I started."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,363,Do you miss it?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,364,- King's Landing? - Your father's house.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,365,Never had a father. Never wanted one.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,366,Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,367,Your talent for fighting?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,368,I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,369,Mine was a slave. So was I.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,370,"Bought and sold, scourged and branded,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,371,"until the Lord of Light reached down,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,372,"took me in his hand, and raised me up."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,373,I was born in Flea Bottom.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,374,Your blood is noble.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,375,"Are you saying my father, he was some lord or..."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,376,There. Your father's house.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,377,I'm just a bastard.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,378,"The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,379,"First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,380,Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,381,There is power in a king's blood.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,382,"Come sit by the fire, child."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,383,"Not talking, eh? That's a first."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,384,I don't talk to traitors.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,385,I didn't like giving up the boy.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,386,But you did.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,387,You took the gold and you gave him up.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,388,The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,389,"When he commands, we obey."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,390,He's not my one true god.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,391,No? Who's yours?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,392,Death.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,393,Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,394,- How many? - No more than 20.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,395,How far?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,396,Less than a day's ride south.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,397,"What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,398,Yeah!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,399,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,400,It will still be west of here two days from now.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,401,You swore.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,402,"To take you home, and I will."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,403,But we need to do this first.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,404,Why? So you can steal their gold?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,405,"I swear to you, this isn't..."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,406,I don't care what you swear
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,407,"because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,408,You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,409,"One day you'll understand, but now..."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,410,"Anguy, bring her back."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,411,"Come back, girl!"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,412,"Kick all you like, wolf girl."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,413,Won't do you no good.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,414,I thought you were gone.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,415,Tomorrow.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,416,Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,417,Lord Bolton's travelling tomorrow as well.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,418,He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,419,You're to remain here.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,420,With Locke?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,421,I owe you a debt.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,422,"When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,423,Now it's your promise.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,424,You gave your word.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,425,Keep it and consider the debt paid.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,426,I will return the Stark girls to their mother.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,427,I swear it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,428,"Good-bye, Ser Jaime."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,429,Here. Let me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,430,It will take time.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,431,Qyburn hopes your father will force
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,432,the Citadel to give him back his chain.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,433,My father will make him grand maester if he grows me a new hand.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,434,"You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,435,Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,436,The Lannisters send their regards.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,437,"Safe journey, Kingslayer."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,438,Nothing to say?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,439,"I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,440,Don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,441,"Gentle, my lord."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,442,Gentle.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,443,Myranda knows what she's doing.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,444,Let her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,445,"She trained as a septa, only..."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,446,She had other urges.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,447,"So did the septons, only they lied about it."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,448,Where is he?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,449,"Who, my lord?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,450,"There's no one here but you, me, and Violet."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,451,Please.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,452,Don't you want us to see it?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,453,"Oh, come on. Let us see it."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,454,Everybody talks about it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,455,Who sent you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,456,Who sent us?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,457,"We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy. We heard so much about it."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,458,Please.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,459,Oh!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,460,There it is.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,461,Oh...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,462,Do you think we're ugly?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,463,He thinks we're ugly.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,464,"Well, he's been through so much."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,465,Look at his poor face.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,466,Help me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,467,If he comes back...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,468,We need to make him feel better.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,469,And how can we make him feel better?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,470,I have an idea.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,471,Aw!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,472,"She's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,473,Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,474,I felt something.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,475,"Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,476,As good as they say?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,477,Mmm.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,478,And why should you get all the fun?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,479,What? You like her better?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,480,Plenty there for both of us.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,481,I was here first.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,482,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,483,Terrible timing.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,484,But I was getting jealous.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,485,Well?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,486,Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,487,Everyone knows you love girls.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,488,I bet you always thought they loved you back.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,489,Your famous cock must be very precious to you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,490,Would you say it's your most precious part?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,491,Please.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,492,"No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,493,This is mercy.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,494,I'm not killing you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,495,Just making a few alterations.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,496,"No! No! No! Please, no! No!"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,497,"No! No, please! Please!"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,498,You're gonna scare it off.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,499,I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,500,It's too far away.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,501,Is that a palace?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,502,It's a windmill.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,503,Windmill.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,504,Who built it? Some king?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,505,Just the men who used to live here.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,506,"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,507,Winterfell has towers three times that size.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,508,"""Oh, I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,509,"""My daddy was a fancy lord"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,510,"""and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds."""
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,511,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,512,if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,513,What's swooning?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,514,Fainting.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,515,What's fainting?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,516,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,517,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,518,Well...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,519,Not all girls are like you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,520,"Well, girls see more blood than boys."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,521,"Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,522,"Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,523,My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,524,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,525,Would you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,526,So I could tear it off you.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,527,"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,528,Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,529,Or maybe one day I'll take you there.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,530,After we've taken our land back.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,531,Ygritte.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,532,You won't win.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,533,"I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,534,You know nothing...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,535,"Six times in the last thousand years,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,536,a King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the kingdoms.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,537,Six times they failed.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,538,And how do you know that?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,539,Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,540,"Where the battles were fought, the heroes, who died where."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,541,Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,542,The seventh will be the same.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,543,Mance is different.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,544,You don't have the discipline.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,545,You don't have the training. Your army is no army.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,546,You don't know how to fight together.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,547,You don't know that.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,548,I do.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,549,I know it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,550,"If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,551,All of us.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,552,You're mine as I'm yours.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,553,"And if we die, we die."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,554,But first we'll live.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,555,"Yes, first we'll live."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,556,What's he going on about?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,557,And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,558,Hodor.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,559,- That's where we are. - What are you telling him?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,560,"- It's all right, Osha. - It's not all right."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,561,You think I can't hear you every day?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,562,Filling his head with black magic.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,563,Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,564,Leave him alone.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,565,He can speak for himself.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,566,I don't fill his head with anything.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,567,"So, what do you talk about?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,568,What's happening to him and what that means.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,569,"Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,570,It's not like that.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,571,I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,572,I don't want you talking to him any more.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,573,Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,574,We're not going to Castle Black.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,575,What did you say?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,576,I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,577,Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,578,"Oh, no. I'm not going back there."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,579,Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,580,Look at me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,581,The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,582,He wants me to find him.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,583,I don't have my legs any more.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,584,This is what I have now.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,585,You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,586,"so you can get back to them, where you belong."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,587,What if I belong in the North?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,588,What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,589,Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,590,All these bad things happened because the Gods got big plans for you?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,591,"I wish it were true, little lord."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,592,But the Gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,593,You don't understand. You don't know.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,594,You don't know. None of you know.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,595,None of you have been up there.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,596,I had a man once. A good man.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,597,"Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,598,But one night Bruni disappears.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,599,"People said he left me, but I knew him."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,600,He'd never leave me. Not for long.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,601,I knew he'd come back.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,602,And he did.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,603,He came in through the back of the hut.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,604,Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,605,His skin was pale like a dead man's.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,606,His eyes bluer than clear sky.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,607,"He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,608,I could feel the life slipping out of me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,609,I don't know how I got the knife.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,610,"When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,611,And he hardly seemed to notice.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,612,I had to burn our hut down with him inside.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,613,I didn't ask the Gods what it meant.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,614,I didn't need to. I already knew.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,615,It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not any more.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,616,I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,617,"How is the pain, my lord?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,618,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,619,"Well, we've stymied the corruption."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,620,"Yes, we've stymied the corruption."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,621,You're a learned man.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,622,All the good it's done me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,623,You did well sewing up this mess.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,624,You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,625,"Faint praise, my lord."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,626,"So, why did the Citadel take your chain?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,627,Did you fondle one boy too many?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,628,"No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,629,What is?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,630,Curiosity.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,631,"The only way to treat disease is to understand disease,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,632,and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,633,You performed experiments on living men.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,634,- On dying men. - With their permission?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,635,My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,636,"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,637,You found them moaning in the poorhouse
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,638,and had them carted back to your garret
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,639,and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,640,"How many men have you killed, my lord?"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,641,- I don't know. - 50?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,642,100?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,643,Countless.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,644,"""Countless"" has a nice ring to it."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,645,And how many lives have you saved?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,646,Half a million.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,647,The population of King's Landing.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,648,You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,649,Did you... Did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,650,A bird flew off and a bird flew back.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,651,Lord Selwyn Tarth
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,652,offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,653,A fair offer.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,654,A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,655,Why not?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,656,He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,657,He feels he's being cheated.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,658,They'd be fools to kill her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,659,These men have been at war a long time.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,660,Most of them will be dead by winter.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,661,She'll be their entertainment tonight.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,662,"Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,663,We have to return to Harrenhal.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,664,- Why? - I've left something behind.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,665,Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,666,And what are those orders?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,667,To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,668,You think you'll get a reward.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,669,I serve Lord Bolton.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,670,Any appreciation your father...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,671,You think you're getting a reward.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,672,"Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,673,"the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,674,and I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,675,I had nothing...
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,676,Or I could tell him this man saved my life.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,677,We return to Harrenhal. Now.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,678,"- Eyes open, lads. - Be quiet."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,679,"The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,680,"From there to here, from here to there"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,681,All black and brown and covered in hair
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,682,He smelt that girl in the summer air
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,683,"The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,684,Don't spare her.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,685,Don't spare her!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,686,"Well, this is one shameful fucking performance."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,687,Stop running and fight.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,688,A wooden sword?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,689,I thought you'd gone.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,690,You gave her a wooden sword!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,691,We've only got one bear.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,692,I'll pay her bloody ransom.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,693,"Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,694,All you lords and ladies still think that
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,695,the only thing that matters is gold.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,696,This makes me happier than all your gold ever could.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,697,And that makes me happier than all her sapphires.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,698,So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,699,- Get behind me. - I will not.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,700,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,701,"Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive,"
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,702,and that's what I aim to do.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,703,Pull her up!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,704,Hold my legs.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,705,Pull him up!
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,706,The bitch stays.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,707,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,708,She belongs to me.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,709,Lord Bolton's orders.
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,710,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,711,Getting his pet rat a reward
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,712,or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,713,"Well, we must be on our way."
S03E07,The Bear And The Maiden Fair,714,Sorry about the sapphires.
S03E08,Second Sons,1,"I'll give you one try, girl."
S03E08,Second Sons,2,Kill me and you're free.
S03E08,Second Sons,3,"But if I live, I'll break both your hands."
S03E08,Second Sons,4,"Go on, hit me."
S03E08,Second Sons,5,Hit me hard.
S03E08,Second Sons,6,Sulk all you want.
S03E08,Second Sons,7,"The truth is, you're lucky."
S03E08,Second Sons,8,"You don't want to be alone out here, girl."
S03E08,Second Sons,9,Someone worse than me would find you.
S03E08,Second Sons,10,There's no one worse than you.
S03E08,Second Sons,11,You never knew my brother.
S03E08,Second Sons,12,He once killed a man for snoring.
S03E08,Second Sons,13,There's plenty worse than me.
S03E08,Second Sons,14,"There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them."
S03E08,Second Sons,15,I saved your sister from some of them.
S03E08,Second Sons,16,You're lying.
S03E08,Second Sons,17,"Ask her, if you ever see her again."
S03E08,Second Sons,18,Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back.
S03E08,Second Sons,19,They would have taken her every which way
S03E08,Second Sons,20,and left her there with her throat cut open.
S03E08,Second Sons,21,Is that the Blackwater?
S03E08,Second Sons,22,The Blackwater?
S03E08,Second Sons,23,Where do you think I'm taking you?
S03E08,Second Sons,24,"Back to King's Landing, to Joffrey and the Queen."
S03E08,Second Sons,25,Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen.
S03E08,Second Sons,26,That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
S03E08,Second Sons,27,But why?
S03E08,Second Sons,28,"Your mother and brother will be there, and they'll pay me for you."
S03E08,Second Sons,29,Why would they be at the Twins?
S03E08,Second Sons,30,Those outlaws you love so much never told you?
S03E08,Second Sons,31,The whole countryside is yapping about it.
S03E08,Second Sons,32,Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.
S03E08,Second Sons,33,"So quit trying to bash my skull in,"
S03E08,Second Sons,34,and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
S03E08,Second Sons,35,Men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty.
S03E08,Second Sons,36,They cannot be trusted.
S03E08,Second Sons,37,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid.
S03E08,Second Sons,38,The Yunkish are paying them well.
S03E08,Second Sons,39,You know these men?
S03E08,Second Sons,40,Only by the broken swords on their banners.
S03E08,Second Sons,41,They're called the Second Sons.
S03E08,Second Sons,42,"A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan's Bastard."
S03E08,Second Sons,43,Is he more titan or bastard?
S03E08,Second Sons,44,"He's a dangerous man, Khaleesi. They all are."
S03E08,Second Sons,45,How many?
S03E08,Second Sons,46,"2,000, Your Grace. Armoured and mounted."
S03E08,Second Sons,47,Enough to make a difference?
S03E08,Second Sons,48,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.
S03E08,Second Sons,49,I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
S03E08,Second Sons,50,I imagine you're right.
S03E08,Second Sons,51,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
S03E08,Second Sons,52,He may not agree to meet.
S03E08,Second Sons,53,He will.
S03E08,Second Sons,54,A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
S03E08,Second Sons,55,"Your Grace, allow me to present"
S03E08,Second Sons,56,"the captains of the Second Sons,"
S03E08,Second Sons,57,"Mero of Braavos,"
S03E08,Second Sons,58,"Prendahl na Ghezn,"
S03E08,Second Sons,59,"and, um..."
S03E08,Second Sons,60,Daario Naharis.
S03E08,Second Sons,61,You are the Mother of Dragons?
S03E08,Second Sons,62,I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
S03E08,Second Sons,63,Mind your tongue.
S03E08,Second Sons,64,Why?
S03E08,Second Sons,65,I didn't mind hers.
S03E08,Second Sons,66,She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
S03E08,Second Sons,67,"You, slave girl, bring wine."
S03E08,Second Sons,68,We have no slaves here.
S03E08,Second Sons,69,"You'll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you."
S03E08,Second Sons,70,"Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap,"
S03E08,Second Sons,71,and I may give you my Second Sons.
S03E08,Second Sons,72,Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.
S03E08,Second Sons,73,"Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
S03E08,Second Sons,74,"Under 2,000, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,75,"We have more, don't we?"
S03E08,Second Sons,76,"10,000 Unsullied."
S03E08,Second Sons,77,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war,"
S03E08,Second Sons,78,but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself
S03E08,Second Sons,79,can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
S03E08,Second Sons,80,I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.
S03E08,Second Sons,81,"You have 8,000 Unsullied."
S03E08,Second Sons,82,You're very young to be a captain.
S03E08,Second Sons,83,He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
S03E08,Second Sons,84,"Even if your numbers are right,"
S03E08,Second Sons,85,the odds don't favour your side.
S03E08,Second Sons,86,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
S03E08,Second Sons,87,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
S03E08,Second Sons,88,Or you could fight for me.
S03E08,Second Sons,89,We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
S03E08,Second Sons,90,I would pay you as much and more.
S03E08,Second Sons,91,Our contract is our bond.
S03E08,Second Sons,92,"If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
S03E08,Second Sons,93,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract.
S03E08,Second Sons,94,You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing
S03E08,Second Sons,95,when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
S03E08,Second Sons,96,You have no ships. You have no siege weapons.
S03E08,Second Sons,97,You have no cavalry.
S03E08,Second Sons,98,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons."
S03E08,Second Sons,99,You have two days to decide.
S03E08,Second Sons,100,Show me your cunt. I want to see
S03E08,Second Sons,101,if it's worth fighting for.
S03E08,Second Sons,102,"My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
S03E08,Second Sons,103,These men are our guests.
S03E08,Second Sons,104,You seem to be enjoying my wine.
S03E08,Second Sons,105,Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
S03E08,Second Sons,106,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
S03E08,Second Sons,107,"- A barrel, then. - Good."
S03E08,Second Sons,108,The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.
S03E08,Second Sons,109,"In the Second Sons, we share everything."
S03E08,Second Sons,110,"After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
S03E08,Second Sons,111,I'll come looking for you when this is over.
S03E08,Second Sons,112,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
S03E08,Second Sons,113,"Gladly, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,114,"Half Robert, half lowborn."
S03E08,Second Sons,115,Show the boy to his chambers.
S03E08,Second Sons,116,Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.
S03E08,Second Sons,117,I'll come visit you soon.
S03E08,Second Sons,118,What do you mean to do with him?
S03E08,Second Sons,119,You know.
S03E08,Second Sons,120,Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?
S03E08,Second Sons,121,"If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
S03E08,Second Sons,122,"Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
S03E08,Second Sons,123,No.
S03E08,Second Sons,124,"If the lamb sees the knife, she panics."
S03E08,Second Sons,125,"Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavour."
S03E08,Second Sons,126,You've slaughtered many lambs?
S03E08,Second Sons,127,And none have seen the blade.
S03E08,Second Sons,128,"""And though"
S03E08,Second Sons,129,"""Visenya"
S03E08,Second Sons,130,"""Targaryen"
S03E08,Second Sons,131,"""rode"
S03E08,Second Sons,132,"""Vhagar"
S03E08,Second Sons,133,"""Vhag..."""
S03E08,Second Sons,134,Fuck me.
S03E08,Second Sons,135,"""Visenya Targaryen"
S03E08,Second Sons,136,"""rode Vhagar,"
S03E08,Second Sons,137,"""the smallest of the dragons,"
S03E08,Second Sons,138,"""though still"
S03E08,Second Sons,139,"""large"
S03E08,Second Sons,140,"""enough"
S03E08,Second Sons,141,"""to swallow a horse whole."""
S03E08,Second Sons,142,Your Grace.
S03E08,Second Sons,143,They feeding you enough?
S03E08,Second Sons,144,Two meals a day.
S03E08,Second Sons,145,"Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
S03E08,Second Sons,146,You don't belong in a place like this.
S03E08,Second Sons,147,"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
S03E08,Second Sons,148,Yeah.
S03E08,Second Sons,149,I'm sorry about your son.
S03E08,Second Sons,150,Didn't get the chance to tell you before.
S03E08,Second Sons,151,Good lad. Loyal lad.
S03E08,Second Sons,152,Melisandre's returned.
S03E08,Second Sons,153,I didn't know she'd been gone.
S03E08,Second Sons,154,Came back with a bastard boy.
S03E08,Second Sons,155,Robert's bastard boy.
S03E08,Second Sons,156,Why?
S03E08,Second Sons,157,She says there's power in king's blood.
S03E08,Second Sons,158,She's going to kill him.
S03E08,Second Sons,159,Sacrifice him.
S03E08,Second Sons,160,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man,"
S03E08,Second Sons,161,but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?
S03E08,Second Sons,162,The boy is your nephew.
S03E08,Second Sons,163,What of it? We're at war.
S03E08,Second Sons,164,Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut
S03E08,Second Sons,165,Robert bedded one drunken night?
S03E08,Second Sons,166,Because he has your blood in his veins.
S03E08,Second Sons,167,So did Renly.
S03E08,Second Sons,168,Renly wronged you.
S03E08,Second Sons,169,Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.
S03E08,Second Sons,170,"He raised an army, stole your bannermen."
S03E08,Second Sons,171,This boy has done you no harm.
S03E08,Second Sons,172,He's an innocent.
S03E08,Second Sons,173,How many boys live in Westeros?
S03E08,Second Sons,174,How many girls? How many men? How many women?
S03E08,Second Sons,175,"The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends."
S03E08,Second Sons,176,Unless I triumph. I never asked for this.
S03E08,Second Sons,177,No more than I asked to be king.
S03E08,Second Sons,178,"We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?"
S03E08,Second Sons,179,"Great or small, we must do our duty."
S03E08,Second Sons,180,What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?
S03E08,Second Sons,181,"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
S03E08,Second Sons,182,I came to free you.
S03E08,Second Sons,183,If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
S03E08,Second Sons,184,I swear it.
S03E08,Second Sons,185,I can't swear never to speak against her.
S03E08,Second Sons,186,You have little regard for your own life.
S03E08,Second Sons,187,"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none."
S03E08,Second Sons,188,"You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow,"
S03E08,Second Sons,189,but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife
S03E08,Second Sons,190,because you knew I'd counsel restraint.
S03E08,Second Sons,191,You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.
S03E08,Second Sons,192,You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory.
S03E08,Second Sons,193,"When my son was five, he said to me,"
S03E08,Second Sons,194,"""I don't ever want to die."""
S03E08,Second Sons,195,"I wanted to say to him, ""You won't, child. You won't ever."""
S03E08,Second Sons,196,"I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid."
S03E08,Second Sons,197,I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods
S03E08,Second Sons,198,because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
S03E08,Second Sons,199,I saw a vision in the flames.
S03E08,Second Sons,200,A great battle in the snow. I saw it.
S03E08,Second Sons,201,And you saw whatever she gave birth to.
S03E08,Second Sons,202,"I never believed, but when you see the truth,"
S03E08,Second Sons,203,"when it's right there in front of you,"
S03E08,Second Sons,204,"as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
S03E08,Second Sons,205,That dragon bitch. She talks too much.
S03E08,Second Sons,206,You talk too much.
S03E08,Second Sons,207,She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
S03E08,Second Sons,208,"8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock."
S03E08,Second Sons,209,My cock will find a way. Tell him.
S03E08,Second Sons,210,Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
S03E08,Second Sons,211,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
S03E08,Second Sons,212,"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
S03E08,Second Sons,213,I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them.
S03E08,Second Sons,214,"And I'm no whore, my friend."
S03E08,Second Sons,215,"She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade."
S03E08,Second Sons,216,- What's the difference? - I fight for beauty.
S03E08,Second Sons,217,For beauty?
S03E08,Second Sons,218,We fight for gold.
S03E08,Second Sons,219,"The Gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die,"
S03E08,Second Sons,220,the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked
S03E08,Second Sons,221,and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
S03E08,Second Sons,222,You'll die young.
S03E08,Second Sons,223,What do we do about the dragon girl?
S03E08,Second Sons,224,"We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield."
S03E08,Second Sons,225,"There won't be a battle, and we don't have to deal with her eunuchs."
S03E08,Second Sons,226,We only have to deal with her.
S03E08,Second Sons,227,She's well-guarded.
S03E08,Second Sons,228,Tonight's a new moon.
S03E08,Second Sons,229,One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
S03E08,Second Sons,230,Which one of us?
S03E08,Second Sons,231,"Close your eyes, love."
S03E08,Second Sons,232,Three coins.
S03E08,Second Sons,233,"A coin from Meereen,"
S03E08,Second Sons,234,"a coin from Volantis,"
S03E08,Second Sons,235,and a coin from Braavos.
S03E08,Second Sons,236,The Braavosi does the deed.
S03E08,Second Sons,237,"One for each of us, darling."
S03E08,Second Sons,238,No peeking.
S03E08,Second Sons,239,Do you hear me?
S03E08,Second Sons,240,Follow my voice. I'm right here.
S03E08,Second Sons,241,You have something for me?
S03E08,Second Sons,242,Valar Morghulis.
S03E08,Second Sons,243,Lady Sansa.
S03E08,Second Sons,244,"You look very handsome, my lord."
S03E08,Second Sons,245,"Oh, yes."
S03E08,Second Sons,246,The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious.
S03E08,Second Sons,247,Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind?
S03E08,Second Sons,248,"Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
S03E08,Second Sons,249,"My lady, I want you to know"
S03E08,Second Sons,250,I didn't ask for this.
S03E08,Second Sons,251,"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
S03E08,Second Sons,252,"No, don't."
S03E08,Second Sons,253,You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner any more.
S03E08,Second Sons,254,You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife.
S03E08,Second Sons,255,I suppose that's a different kind of prison.
S03E08,Second Sons,256,I just wanted to say...
S03E08,Second Sons,257,"I'm just trying to say, very badly..."
S03E08,Second Sons,258,I just...
S03E08,Second Sons,259,Just want to say I know how you feel.
S03E08,Second Sons,260,"I doubt that very much, my lord."
S03E08,Second Sons,261,You're right. I have no idea how you feel.
S03E08,Second Sons,262,And you have no idea how I feel.
S03E08,Second Sons,263,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you."
S03E08,Second Sons,264,Do you drink wine?
S03E08,Second Sons,265,When I have to.
S03E08,Second Sons,266,"Well, today you have to."
S03E08,Second Sons,267,"You look radiant, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,268,Radiant? Why radiant?
S03E08,Second Sons,269,It's the word that came to mind.
S03E08,Second Sons,270,We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
S03E08,Second Sons,271,"You're a musical girl, aren't you?"
S03E08,Second Sons,272,I imagine you have a lovely voice.
S03E08,Second Sons,273,"A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
S03E08,Second Sons,274,But you know the song The Rains of Castamere?
S03E08,Second Sons,275,Of course. They play it so often here at court.
S03E08,Second Sons,276,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
S03E08,Second Sons,277,"Not as well as you, I'm sure."
S03E08,Second Sons,278,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy.
S03E08,Second Sons,279,The second wealthiest in Westeros.
S03E08,Second Sons,280,Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
S03E08,Second Sons,281,Ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung.
S03E08,Second Sons,282,"If only you could take that final step,"
S03E08,Second Sons,283,you'd see further than all the rest.
S03E08,Second Sons,284,You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.
S03E08,Second Sons,285,So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock.
S03E08,Second Sons,286,He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore.
S03E08,Second Sons,287,"And finally one day, he rebelled against my father."
S03E08,Second Sons,288,Do you know where House Reyne is now?
S03E08,Second Sons,289,Gone.
S03E08,Second Sons,290,Gone.
S03E08,Second Sons,291,"A gentle word. Why not say ""slaughtered""?"
S03E08,Second Sons,292,"Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
S03E08,Second Sons,293,I remember seeing their bodies hanging
S03E08,Second Sons,294,high above the gates of Casterly Rock.
S03E08,Second Sons,295,My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer.
S03E08,Second Sons,296,"""And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear."""
S03E08,Second Sons,297,"If you ever call me ""sister"" again,"
S03E08,Second Sons,298,I'll have you strangled in your sleep.
S03E08,Second Sons,299,What are you doing?
S03E08,Second Sons,300,Your father's gone.
S03E08,Second Sons,301,"As the father of the realm, it is my duty"
S03E08,Second Sons,302,to give you away to your husband.
S03E08,Second Sons,303,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
S03E08,Second Sons,304,Uh...
S03E08,Second Sons,305,Could you...
S03E08,Second Sons,306,Thank you.
S03E08,Second Sons,307,"Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies,"
S03E08,Second Sons,308,we stand here in the sight of gods and men
S03E08,Second Sons,309,to witness the union of man and wife.
S03E08,Second Sons,310,"One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
S03E08,Second Sons,311,Have you ever seen one like it?
S03E08,Second Sons,312,I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
S03E08,Second Sons,313,"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth?"
S03E08,Second Sons,314,"When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day."
S03E08,Second Sons,315,And stew is a kind word for it.
S03E08,Second Sons,316,"In Flea Bottom we called them ""bowls of brown."""
S03E08,Second Sons,317,We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.
S03E08,Second Sons,318,We knew it wasn't chicken.
S03E08,Second Sons,319,"Here, taste this."
S03E08,Second Sons,320,You think I'm trying to poison you?
S03E08,Second Sons,321,That's good.
S03E08,Second Sons,322,That's really good.
S03E08,Second Sons,323,Where do you think it's from?
S03E08,Second Sons,324,I couldn't even guess.
S03E08,Second Sons,325,"Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not."
S03E08,Second Sons,326,You only need a tongue to tell the difference.
S03E08,Second Sons,327,"Go on, have some more."
S03E08,Second Sons,328,You still don't trust it.
S03E08,Second Sons,329,You think this is all a mistake
S03E08,Second Sons,330,that you have to pay for every bite you take.
S03E08,Second Sons,331,"That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
S03E08,Second Sons,332,There are no mistakes.
S03E08,Second Sons,333,Not for us.
S03E08,Second Sons,334,I'm a mistake.
S03E08,Second Sons,335,I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother
S03E08,Second Sons,336,instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
S03E08,Second Sons,337,Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.
S03E08,Second Sons,338,He willed it so you could be here right now
S03E08,Second Sons,339,with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand.
S03E08,Second Sons,340,And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.
S03E08,Second Sons,341,We're both a part of His plan.
S03E08,Second Sons,342,"He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
S03E08,Second Sons,343,I don't understand. This...
S03E08,Second Sons,344,This doesn't seem very religious.
S03E08,Second Sons,345,According to whom?
S03E08,Second Sons,346,The Silent Sisters?
S03E08,Second Sons,347,"With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?"
S03E08,Second Sons,348,What have their gods done for you?
S03E08,Second Sons,349,Mmm?
S03E08,Second Sons,350,"When you pray to them, what's their answer?"
S03E08,Second Sons,351,A god is real or he's not.
S03E08,Second Sons,352,You only need eyes to see.
S03E08,Second Sons,353,Death is coming for everyone and everything.
S03E08,Second Sons,354,A darkness that will swallow the dawn.
S03E08,Second Sons,355,"And we can stop it, you and I."
S03E08,Second Sons,356,Let me show you what you have inside you.
S03E08,Second Sons,357,Come fight death with me.
S03E08,Second Sons,358,What are you doing?
S03E08,Second Sons,359,You have to trust me.
S03E08,Second Sons,360,What...
S03E08,Second Sons,361,Get it away.
S03E08,Second Sons,362,Get it off me.
S03E08,Second Sons,363,"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
S03E08,Second Sons,364,Why are you doing this?
S03E08,Second Sons,365,I told you there's power in the blood of kings.
S03E08,Second Sons,366,And you have so much blood.
S03E08,Second Sons,367,No.
S03E08,Second Sons,368,"No, no, no, no!"
S03E08,Second Sons,369,Not there. Not there!
S03E08,Second Sons,370,You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.
S03E08,Second Sons,371,He wanted a demonstration.
S03E08,Second Sons,372,"Please. Please, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,373,My lord!
S03E08,Second Sons,374,The usurper Robb Stark.
S03E08,Second Sons,375,The usurper Balon Greyjoy.
S03E08,Second Sons,376,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
S03E08,Second Sons,377,So their son will be your nephew.
S03E08,Second Sons,378,"After you're wed to Cersei, of course."
S03E08,Second Sons,379,And you will be the King's stepfather and brother-in-law.
S03E08,Second Sons,380,"When you marry the King, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law"
S03E08,Second Sons,381,and your son will be Loras' nephew?
S03E08,Second Sons,382,Grandson? I'm not sure.
S03E08,Second Sons,383,But your brother will become your father-in-law.
S03E08,Second Sons,384,That much is beyond dispute.
S03E08,Second Sons,385,"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
S03E08,Second Sons,386,Of course. Of course. Enjoy.
S03E08,Second Sons,387,Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
S03E08,Second Sons,388,I've got a lifetime for that.
S03E08,Second Sons,389,Stay.
S03E08,Second Sons,390,You seem rather drunk.
S03E08,Second Sons,391,Rather less than I plan to be.
S03E08,Second Sons,392,Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
S03E08,Second Sons,393,This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding.
S03E08,Second Sons,394,"Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
S03E08,Second Sons,395,And?
S03E08,Second Sons,396,"If you're going to give her one,"
S03E08,Second Sons,397,you need to perform.
S03E08,Second Sons,398,What did you once call me?
S03E08,Second Sons,399,A drunken little lust-filled beast.
S03E08,Second Sons,400,- More than once. - There you have it.
S03E08,Second Sons,401,Nothing to worry about.
S03E08,Second Sons,402,"Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things."
S03E08,Second Sons,403,I am the god of tits and wine.
S03E08,Second Sons,404,I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
S03E08,Second Sons,405,"You can drink, you can joke,"
S03E08,Second Sons,406,you can engage in juvenile attempts
S03E08,Second Sons,407,"to make your father uncomfortable,"
S03E08,Second Sons,408,but you will do your duty.
S03E08,Second Sons,409,Well...
S03E08,Second Sons,410,My father once told me...
S03E08,Second Sons,411,Nobody cares what your father once told you.
S03E08,Second Sons,412,"Congratulations, my lady."
S03E08,Second Sons,413,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,414,"Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister."
S03E08,Second Sons,415,Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.
S03E08,Second Sons,416,"It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?"
S03E08,Second Sons,417,What a glorious day.
S03E08,Second Sons,418,"Yes, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,419,I suppose it doesn't really matter
S03E08,Second Sons,420,which Lannister puts the baby into you.
S03E08,Second Sons,421,Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.
S03E08,Second Sons,422,How'd you like that?
S03E08,Second Sons,423,You wouldn't?
S03E08,Second Sons,424,That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
S03E08,Second Sons,425,Time for the bedding ceremony.
S03E08,Second Sons,426,Ah!
S03E08,Second Sons,427,There will be no bedding ceremony.
S03E08,Second Sons,428,"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?"
S03E08,Second Sons,429,"Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed."
S03E08,Second Sons,430,Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer.
S03E08,Second Sons,431,"Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
S03E08,Second Sons,432,There will be no bedding ceremony.
S03E08,Second Sons,433,There will be if I command it.
S03E08,Second Sons,434,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
S03E08,Second Sons,435,What did you say?
S03E08,Second Sons,436,What did you say?
S03E08,Second Sons,437,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,438,I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the King.
S03E08,Second Sons,439,"A bad joke, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,440,Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.
S03E08,Second Sons,441,Mine is so small.
S03E08,Second Sons,442,My poor wife won't even know I'm there.
S03E08,Second Sons,443,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,444,I am.
S03E08,Second Sons,445,Guilty.
S03E08,Second Sons,446,But...
S03E08,Second Sons,447,But it is my wedding night.
S03E08,Second Sons,448,My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.
S03E08,Second Sons,449,"Come, wife."
S03E08,Second Sons,450,I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act.
S03E08,Second Sons,451,Not proud of it.
S03E08,Second Sons,452,But I think honesty is important
S03E08,Second Sons,453,"between a man and wife, don't you agree?"
S03E08,Second Sons,454,"Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
S03E08,Second Sons,455,"Is that wise, my lord?"
S03E08,Second Sons,456,"Tyrion, Sansa."
S03E08,Second Sons,457,My name is Tyrion.
S03E08,Second Sons,458,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
S03E08,Second Sons,459,Nothing was ever wiser.
S03E08,Second Sons,460,Astoundingly long.
S03E08,Second Sons,461,What?
S03E08,Second Sons,462,Neck.
S03E08,Second Sons,463,You have one.
S03E08,Second Sons,464,How old are you exactly?
S03E08,Second Sons,465,14.
S03E08,Second Sons,466,"Well, talk won't make you any older."
S03E08,Second Sons,467,My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
S03E08,Second Sons,468,Stop.
S03E08,Second Sons,469,I can't.
S03E08,Second Sons,470,"I could, I won't."
S03E08,Second Sons,471,But your father...
S03E08,Second Sons,472,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start."
S03E08,Second Sons,473,I won't share your bed.
S03E08,Second Sons,474,Not until you want me to.
S03E08,Second Sons,475,What if I never want you to?
S03E08,Second Sons,476,And so my watch begins.
S03E08,Second Sons,477,Nineteen?
S03E08,Second Sons,478,"Yes, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,479,How can anyone speak 19 languages?
S03E08,Second Sons,480,It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
S03E08,Second Sons,481,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki"
S03E08,Second Sons,482,or grunt at my husband and hope...
S03E08,Second Sons,483,"What do you mean, ""reasonably well""?"
S03E08,Second Sons,484,Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.
S03E08,Second Sons,485,So guttural and harsh.
S03E08,Second Sons,486,Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it.
S03E08,Second Sons,487,It gave him great pride.
S03E08,Second Sons,488,Athjahakar.
S03E08,Second Sons,489,Athjahaka.
S03E08,Second Sons,490,Ath-ja-hakar.
S03E08,Second Sons,491,Athjahakar.
S03E08,Second Sons,492,"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
S03E08,Second Sons,493,"Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace."
S03E08,Second Sons,494,The Gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.
S03E08,Second Sons,495,It is the only proper language for poetry.
S03E08,Second Sons,496,"No screaming, or she dies."
S03E08,Second Sons,497,What do you want?
S03E08,Second Sons,498,You.
S03E08,Second Sons,499,Let her go.
S03E08,Second Sons,500,"Don't scream, lovely girl."
S03E08,Second Sons,501,You were sent here to kill me?
S03E08,Second Sons,502,So why haven't you?
S03E08,Second Sons,503,I don't want to.
S03E08,Second Sons,504,What do your captains have to say about that?
S03E08,Second Sons,505,You should ask them.
S03E08,Second Sons,506,Why?
S03E08,Second Sons,507,We had philosophical differences.
S03E08,Second Sons,508,Over what?
S03E08,Second Sons,509,Your beauty.
S03E08,Second Sons,510,It meant more to me than it did to them.
S03E08,Second Sons,511,You're a strange man.
S03E08,Second Sons,512,I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
S03E08,Second Sons,513,And this is supposed to impress me?
S03E08,Second Sons,514,Yes.
S03E08,Second Sons,515,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
S03E08,Second Sons,516,They ordered me to murder you.
S03E08,Second Sons,517,I told them I preferred not to.
S03E08,Second Sons,518,They told me I had no choice.
S03E08,Second Sons,519,I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice.
S03E08,Second Sons,520,They drew their swords and I drew mine.
S03E08,Second Sons,521,Will you fight for me?
S03E08,Second Sons,522,Swear to me.
S03E08,Second Sons,523,"The Second Sons are yours, and so is Daario Naharis."
S03E08,Second Sons,524,"My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
S03E08,Second Sons,525,You really ought to knock.
S03E08,Second Sons,526,I brought your breakfast.
S03E08,Second Sons,527,It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
S03E08,Second Sons,528,How hard can it be to build a fire?
S03E08,Second Sons,529,It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
S03E08,Second Sons,530,He winked at me before.
S03E08,Second Sons,531,I doubt it.
S03E08,Second Sons,532,I saw him wink at me.
S03E08,Second Sons,533,He blinked.
S03E08,Second Sons,534,I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference
S03E08,Second Sons,535,between a wink and a blink.
S03E08,Second Sons,536,A what?
S03E08,Second Sons,537,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
S03E08,Second Sons,538,A wink is on purpose.
S03E08,Second Sons,539,You thought of a name yet?
S03E08,Second Sons,540,It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
S03E08,Second Sons,541,Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
S03E08,Second Sons,542,What? No.
S03E08,Second Sons,543,This is just the way I talk.
S03E08,Second Sons,544,I'll build that fire.
S03E08,Second Sons,545,Don't you think he should have a name?
S03E08,Second Sons,546,I don't know many boys' names.
S03E08,Second Sons,547,"Let's see, there's Duncan,"
S03E08,Second Sons,548,"Kevan, Jon..."
S03E08,Second Sons,549,"Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
S03E08,Second Sons,550,Craster.
S03E08,Second Sons,551,Uh... Yes.
S03E08,Second Sons,552,Maybe that's not...
S03E08,Second Sons,553,Mormont.
S03E08,Second Sons,554,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
S03E08,Second Sons,555,Why is it a last name?
S03E08,Second Sons,556,"Well, it's a family name."
S03E08,Second Sons,557,"For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly."
S03E08,Second Sons,558,Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name.
S03E08,Second Sons,559,You see? So my father is also a Tarly.
S03E08,Second Sons,560,"His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
S03E08,Second Sons,561,"No, Randyll Tarly."
S03E08,Second Sons,562,Randyll is a handsome name.
S03E08,Second Sons,563,Please don't name him Randyll.
S03E08,Second Sons,564,"Is your father cruel, like mine?"
S03E08,Second Sons,565,Different manner of cruel.
S03E08,Second Sons,566,"Not Randyll, then."
S03E08,Second Sons,567,Don't.
S03E08,Second Sons,568,Don't go out there.
S03E08,Second Sons,569,I'll be back. I just want to look.
S03E08,Second Sons,570,Go inside.
S03E08,Second Sons,571,Go back inside. I'll...
S03E08,Second Sons,572,It's come for the baby.
S03E08,Second Sons,573,Stay back!
S03E08,Second Sons,574,You stay back!
S03E08,Second Sons,575,"No, you can't have him! No!"
S03E08,Second Sons,576,No!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,1,Are you sure about this?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,2,No.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,3,It's dangerous.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,4,"If we take Tywin's castle from him,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,5,the lords of Westeros will realise he's not invincible.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,6,"Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,7,Why are you telling me?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,8,You begged me not to send Theon
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,9,"to negotiate with his father, and I ignored your advice."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,10,"Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,11,"the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,12,"So, Casterly Rock..."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,13,I'm asking your advice.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,14,We have enough men?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,15,If Walder Frey cooperates.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,16,If Walder Frey cooperates.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,17,"If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,18,we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,19,We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,20,Or worse.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,21,Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,22,"My honoured guests,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,23,be welcome within my walls and at my table.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,24,I extend to you my hospitality
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,25,and protection in the light of the Seven.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,26,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,27,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,28,"Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,29,It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,30,One of them was supposed to be queen.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,31,Now none of them are.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,32,"This is Arwyn, my daughter."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,33,"My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,34,my daughter Waldra.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,35,My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,36,"Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,37,You could have had either.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,38,"Could have had both, for all I care."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,39,My granddaughter Marianne.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,40,My granddaughter Freya.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,41,My granddaughter...
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,42,Wertha.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,43,Waldra.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,44,Waldina.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,45,I'm Merry.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,46,Fine.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,47,"And here's my youngest daughter Shirei,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,48,though she hasn't bled yet.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,49,Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,50,My ladies.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,51,"All men should keep their word, kings most of all."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,52,I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,53,The fault is not with you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,54,Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,55,"I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,56,I know these words cannot set right
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,57,the wrong I have done to you and your house.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,58,I beg your forgiveness
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,59,and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,60,and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,61,Very good.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,62,There she is.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,63,Come closer. Let me have a look at you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,64,Still can't see you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,65,Old eyes.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,66,Love.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,67,"That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,68,Very honourable. I call it a pretty face.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,69,Mmm.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,70,Very pretty.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,71,"Prettier than this lot, that's for sure."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,72,Very shapely as well.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,73,"Oh, you try to hide her under that dress."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,74,"If you wanted to hide her,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,75,you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,76,I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,77,Been at this a long time.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,78,"I bet when you take that dress off,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,79,everything stays right where it is.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,80,Doesn't drop an inch.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,81,Your king says he betrayed me for love.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,82,I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,83,And I can respect that.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,84,"When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,85,to get into that without a second thought.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,86,"Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,87,We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,88,"Thank you, my lord."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,89,"Well, let's get ready."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,90,The wine will flow red
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,91,and the music will play loud
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,92,and we'll put this mess behind us.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,93,Where?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,94,There.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,95,There. It's a back gate.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,96,My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,97,"Your men, but not you?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,98,I have no interest in slaves.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,99,A man cannot make love to property.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,100,This is where we enter the city. Very few guards. They know me.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,101,They let me inside...
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,102,We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,103,I kill the guards.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,104,I take your two best men
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,105,"and lead them through the back streets, which I know well,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,106,and open the front gates.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,107,Then comes the army.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,108,"Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,109,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,110,cutting the head off our army.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,111,The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,112,and you won't have to split it three ways
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,113,'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,114,You have a very suspicious mind.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,115,"In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,116,You command the Unsullied.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,117,What do you think?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,118,You are a leader now.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,119,Do you trust him?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,120,I trust him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,121,You leave tonight.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,122,Very good. We'll prepare.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,123,Ser Jorah.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,124,You can use an extra sword.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,125,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,126,"If we are truly her loyal servants,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,127,"we'll do whatever needs to be done,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,128,"no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,129,"We're west of Castle Black,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,130,but the Nightfort's closest to us.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,131,It was the first castle on the Wall.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,132,The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,133,Too big. Impossible to maintain.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,134,"Other than Castle Black itself,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,135,the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,136,"It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,137,"No one's used it in centuries, most likely."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,138,"It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,139,"if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens,  I do."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,140,How do you know all that?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,141,I read about it in a very old book.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,142,You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,143,Yes.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,144,You're like a wizard.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,145,Our father used to tell us
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,146,that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,147,Here we are.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,148,Alive.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,149,Remember what happens to children who run.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,150,I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,151,The roads have gone right to hell.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,152,Cracked three spokes this morning.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,153,Need a hand?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,154,Need about eight hands.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,155,Oh!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,156,Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,157,Many thanks.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,158,Don't! Don't kill him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,159,Dead rats don't squeak.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,160,"You're so dangerous, aren't you?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,161,Saying scary things to little girls.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,162,Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,163,More than anyone you know.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,164,You're wrong.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,165,I know a killer.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,166,- A real killer. - That so?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,167,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,168,That him?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,169,- No. - Good.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,170,Don't kill him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,171,Please.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,172,Please don't.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,173,You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,174,Where are we?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,175,"The Gift, I think."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,176,Brandon the Builder gave all this land
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,177,south of the Wall to the Night's Watch
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,178,for their sustenance and support.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,179,Maester Luwin taught me that.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,180,Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,181,"It's good land, and there's no war up here."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,182,Why leave?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,183,Wildlings.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,184,Sorry.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,185,"But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,186,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,187,and make you drink your own blood from it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,188,That's what Old Nan said.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,189,There's a storm coming.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,190,I don't see any.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,191,It's as good a place to shelter as any.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,192,We can drink some blood while we wait.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,193,I don't need much.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,194,Only one old man and eight good horses.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,195,What's one old man doing with eight horses?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,196,He breeds them for the Watch.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,197,How's he keep folks from stealing them?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,198,The Watch protects him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,199,"Not today, they don't."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,200,"He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,201,And proper steel.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,202,Let's carve him up.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,203,We just take the horses and go.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,204,The old man's no threat.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,205,I keep telling you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,206,He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,207,than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,208,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,209,They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,210,I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,211,"Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,212,Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,213,Ygritte!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,214,Clear the barn!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,215,No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,216,Best part of the animal.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,217,Don't worry. They're still there.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,218,I know they're still there.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,219,You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,220,I'm not afraid.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,221,Of course you are.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,222,You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,223,"The closer you get, the worse the fear gets."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,224,No point in trying to hide behind that face.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,225,I know fear when I see it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,226,Seen it a lot.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,227,I knew fear when I saw it in you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,228,You're afraid of fire.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,229,"When Beric's sword went up in flames,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,230,you looked like a scared little girl.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,231,"And I know why, too."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,232,I heard what your brother did to you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,233,Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,234,That give you some ideas?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,235,Might do.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,236,"Go ahead, then. You might get away."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,237,Might even make it there on your own.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,238,They're just over the river.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,239,The closest you've been to family
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,240,since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,241,Someday I'll put a sword through
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,242,your eye and out the back of your skull.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,243,How are we going to get past the Wall?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,244,My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,245,How did you get past it?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,246,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,247,It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,248,Some climb straight up the ice.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,249,Even Hodor's not strong enough to
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,250,climb the Wall with me on his back.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,251,Hodor.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,252,Nineteen castles guard the Wall.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,253,Only three are still manned.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,254,Hodor!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,255,One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,256,My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,257,and stone when the castles were deserted.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,258,"Well, we'll have to open them up again."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,259,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,260,There's a rider out there.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,261,Just one?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,262,- There's more. - Hodor!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,263,"It's just thunder, sweet giant."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,264,Hodor.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,265,I yield.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,266,- I yield. - Wildlings.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,267,Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,268,Hunting.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,269,Hodor!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,270,"- Shh. Quiet, Hodor. - Hodor!"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,271,Make him shut up. If they hear us...
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,272,"Hush, Hodor. No... No more Hodoring."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,273,Hodor!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,274,"- Hodor! - Hodor, calm down."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,275,- You need to keep quiet. - They're gonna hear us.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,276,"Hodor, be quiet."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,277,"- Hodor! - Hodor, calm down."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,278,Hodor! Hodor!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,279,"Hodor, be quiet!"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,280,What did you do?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,281,Nothing.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,282,I don't know.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,283,What's that?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,284,That's a horse dying.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,285,Bring them over here.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,286,That was the last of them. The rest are dead.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,287,I heard shouting up there.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,288,Thunder.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,289,I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,290,Maybe it's ghosts.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,291,"That won't help you, grandpa."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,292,Where you riding?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,293,"Doesn't matter now, does it?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,294,"No, it doesn't matter now."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,295,"Cut his throat, or he'll tell the crows we're here."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,296,You understand.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,297,Let me stand at least.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,298,Let me go with a bit of dignity.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,299,Make the crow kill him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,300,You're one of us now. Prove it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,301,The wolves are out there.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,302,I can't do it by choice.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,303,I don't know how.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,304,It happens in my dreams.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,305,"You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,306,I can't.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,307,"You just did, with him."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,308,A wolf is nothing compared to that.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,309,She looks sharp.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,310,Do it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,311,Do it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,312,I told you. He's still one of them.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,313,"Go on, boy."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,314,Go on!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,315,He's a crow. He'll always be a crow.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,316,And here's his crow wife guarding him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,317,He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,318,Kill him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,319,He's one of them.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,320,No!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,321,Do you hear me? Ahh!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,322,You're not gonna die for one of them.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,323,Do it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,324,They'll find us if you don't.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,325,You were right the whole time.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,326,"When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,327,I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,328,Daario Naharis.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,329,That one was quick.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,330,- There may be others. - I doubt it.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,331,The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,332,That's what you call a few guards?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,333,"Come on! What do you got, huh?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,334,"Lord Edmure,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,335,I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,336,"You're a delight to me, my lady."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,337,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,338,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,339,binding them as one for eternity.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,340,Look upon each other and say the words.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,341,"- Father, Smith... - Father, Smith..."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,342,"...Warrior, Mother... ...Warrior, Mother..."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,343,"...Maiden, Crone, Stranger. ...Maiden, Crone, Stranger."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,344,- I am hers... - I am his...
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,345,...and she is mine... ...and he is mine...
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,346,from this day until the end of my days.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,347,Is that safe?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,348,They're long gone.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,349,You were right.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,350,I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,351,Of course you can.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,352,North of the Wall there are wildlings
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,353,who can control all sorts of animals.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,354,But you did a lot more than that.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,355,You got inside Hodor's mind.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,356,They can't do that north of the Wall?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,357,No one can do that. Anywhere.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,358,"When I was looking through Summer's eyes,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,359,- I saw Jon. - Where?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,360,He was with the wildlings.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,361,"They tried to kill him, but he got away."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,362,"He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,363,That's where we should go.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,364,"For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,365,If this many wildlings got through...
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,366,I already told you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,367,I'm not going north of the Wall.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,368,Everything Jojen told me is true.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,369,You saw what I did to Hodor.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,370,I have to find the three-eyed raven.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,371,"Listen to me, little lord."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,372,Don't worry.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,373,I'm not asking you to come with me.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,374,It won't be safe for Rickon.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,375,Me? I'm coming with you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,376,No.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,377,You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,378,The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,379,I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,380,Right now I have to protect you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,381,Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,382,"If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,383,Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,384,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,385,You're easy to find.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,386,We're not Southerners.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,387,And I don't want to leave you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,388,Shh!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,389,"Come here, little soldier."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,390,"You and me, we're gonna have some adventures."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,391,You don't have to do any of this.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,392,Your family took me in and was good to me without cause.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,393,"We'll be fine, you and me."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,394,The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,395,They'll teach you how to swing a sword.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,396,I know how to swing a sword.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,397,You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,398,I learned to walk in darkness.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,399,"Say your good-byes, little man."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,400,Keep this one safe.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,401,He means the world to me.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,402,We've been waiting a long time.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,403,Haven't we?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,404,"Well, I don't know, you tell me."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,405,How long does it take to sack a city?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,406,It was just as you said.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,407,They did not believe until it was too late.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,408,Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,409,And Daario Naharis?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,410,"The city is yours, my queen."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,411,"They're good, aren't they?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,412,They ought to be because they cost enough.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,413,Look at the crowd there.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,414,He complained about this marriage
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,415,"the entire ride from Riverrun,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,416,and now look at him.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,417,The Gods love to reward a fool.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,418,- Uncle. - What?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,419,He's my nephew. I love him. And he's a damned fool.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,420,"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,421,"Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,422,That's the point.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,423,Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,424,Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,425,and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,426,So I have a fat young bride.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,427,I hope she makes you very happy.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,428,"Well, she's made me very rich."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,429,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,430,My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,431,Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,432,Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,433,And I like her.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,434,"But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,435,"playing my harp and you would be sitting over there,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,436,eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,437,Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,438,Striking your king is an act of treason.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,439,"No, don't."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,440,Don't insult them.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,441,Your Grace.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,442,"The septon has prayed his prayers,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,443,"some words were said,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,444,and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,445,But they are not yet man and wife.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,446,A sword needs a sheath.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,447,And a wedding needs a bedding.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,448,What does my sire say?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,449,To bed! To bed! To bed!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,450,"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,451,let us bed them.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,452,To bed! To bed! To bed!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,453,Go on.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,454,Ho-ho!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,455,"Careful now, ladies."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,456,"Once you set that monster free,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,457,there's no caging him again.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,458,To bed! To bed! To bed!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,459,Poor girl.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,460,Every bride suffers the same.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,461,I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,462,"Oh, Ned forbade it."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,463,He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,464,That is a very strange custom.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,465,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,466,It seems normal to you?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,467,It's a tradition.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,468,"Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,469,the lord and lady consummated their marriage.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,470,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,471,Boy or girl?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,472,I don't know.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,473,"But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,474,"Oh, do you?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,475,It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,476,Eddard.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,477,Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,478,I do.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,479,"Go on, line 'em up!"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,480,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,481,Where are you going?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,482,Got salt pork for the feast.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,483,The feast is over.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,484,Doesn't sound like it's over.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,485,"If I tell you it's over, it's over."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,486,Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,487,"Got pig's feet, too."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,488,Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,489,Your Grace.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,490,I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,491,"I've given you meat and wine and music,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,492,but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,493,My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,494,Robb!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,495,Ohh!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,496,Ahh!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,497,Ahh!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,498,"You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,499,"Feast over yet, is it?"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,500,"Aye, it's over."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,501,Aim!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,502,It's too late.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,503,The King in the North arises.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,504,Lord Walder!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,505,"Lord Walder, enough!"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,506,Let it end!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,507,Please. He is my son.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,508,My first son.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,509,"Let him go, and I swear that we will forget this."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,510,I swear it by the Old Gods and New.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,511,We will take no vengeance.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,512,You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,513,You swore by all the Gods your son would marry my daughter!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,514,"Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,515,"Robb, get up. Get up and walk out."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,516,Please!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,517,Please!
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,518,And why would I let him do that?
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,519,"On my honour as a Tully,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,520,"on my honour as a Stark,"
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,521,"let him go, or I will cut your wife's throat."
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,522,I'll find another.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,523,Mother.
S03E09,The Rains Of Castamere,524,The Lannisters send their regards.
S03E10,Mhysa,1,"Go, move out!"
S03E10,Mhysa,2,Here comes the King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,3,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,4,Here comes the King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,5,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,6,Here comes the King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,7,Here comes the King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,8,Here comes the King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,9,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,10,Here comes the King in the North!
S03E10,Mhysa,11,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
S03E10,Mhysa,12,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
S03E10,Mhysa,13,What are you doing?
S03E10,Mhysa,14,I have a list.
S03E10,Mhysa,15,A list of people you mean to kill?
S03E10,Mhysa,16,For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you?
S03E10,Mhysa,17,"No, death seems a bit extreme."
S03E10,Mhysa,18,"Fear of death, on the other hand..."
S03E10,Mhysa,19,You should learn to ignore them.
S03E10,Mhysa,20,"My lady, people have been laughing at me"
S03E10,Mhysa,21,far longer than they've been laughing at you.
S03E10,Mhysa,22,"I'm the halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
S03E10,Mhysa,23,You're a Lannister.
S03E10,Mhysa,24,I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
S03E10,Mhysa,25,The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.
S03E10,Mhysa,26,We're perfect for each other.
S03E10,Mhysa,27,So how should we punish them?
S03E10,Mhysa,28,Who? Whom?
S03E10,Mhysa,29,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
S03E10,Mhysa,30,Ah!
S03E10,Mhysa,31,I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.
S03E10,Mhysa,32,Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
S03E10,Mhysa,33,I hear that you're a pervert.
S03E10,Mhysa,34,I am the Imp.
S03E10,Mhysa,35,I have certain standards to maintain.
S03E10,Mhysa,36,We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.
S03E10,Mhysa,37,You cut a little hole in his mattress
S03E10,Mhysa,38,and you stuff sheep dung inside.
S03E10,Mhysa,39,Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.
S03E10,Mhysa,40,"His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
S03E10,Mhysa,41,Lady Sansa!
S03E10,Mhysa,42,My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.
S03E10,Mhysa,43,And she was always angry with me.
S03E10,Mhysa,44,"Why ""sheep shift""?"
S03E10,Mhysa,45,"That's the vulgar word for ""dung."""
S03E10,Mhysa,46,My lady...
S03E10,Mhysa,47,"Well, you asked me."
S03E10,Mhysa,48,That's him!
S03E10,Mhysa,49,"My lord, my lady."
S03E10,Mhysa,50,Your father has called a meeting of the Small Council.
S03E10,Mhysa,51,Killed a few puppies today?
S03E10,Mhysa,52,Show him.
S03E10,Mhysa,53,"Come on, show him."
S03E10,Mhysa,54,Oh!
S03E10,Mhysa,55,"Apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
S03E10,Mhysa,56,"""Roslin caught a fine fat trout."
S03E10,Mhysa,57,"""Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding."""
S03E10,Mhysa,58,"Signed, ""Walder Frey."""
S03E10,Mhysa,59,Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
S03E10,Mhysa,60,Robb Stark is dead.
S03E10,Mhysa,61,And his bitch mother.
S03E10,Mhysa,62,Write back to Lord Frey.
S03E10,Mhysa,63,Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head.
S03E10,Mhysa,64,I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
S03E10,Mhysa,65,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
S03E10,Mhysa,66,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
S03E10,Mhysa,67,"Yes, I did."
S03E10,Mhysa,68,I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
S03E10,Mhysa,69,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,70,She is no longer yours to torment.
S03E10,Mhysa,71,Everyone is mine to torment.
S03E10,Mhysa,72,"You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
S03E10,Mhysa,73,"Oh, I'm a monster."
S03E10,Mhysa,74,"Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then."
S03E10,Mhysa,75,"Monsters are dangerous, and just now kings are dying like flies."
S03E10,Mhysa,76,I could have your tongue out for saying that.
S03E10,Mhysa,77,Let him make his threats.
S03E10,Mhysa,78,Hmm?
S03E10,Mhysa,79,He's a bitter little man.
S03E10,Mhysa,80,Lord Tyrion should apologise immediately.
S03E10,Mhysa,81,"Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
S03E10,Mhysa,82,I am the King!
S03E10,Mhysa,83,I will punish you.
S03E10,Mhysa,84,"Any man who must say, ""I am the King,"" is no true king."
S03E10,Mhysa,85,I'll make sure you understand that
S03E10,Mhysa,86,when I've won your war for you.
S03E10,Mhysa,87,My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar.
S03E10,Mhysa,88,He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
S03E10,Mhysa,89,The King is tired. See him to his chambers.
S03E10,Mhysa,90,- Come along. - I'm not tired.
S03E10,Mhysa,91,We have so much to celebrate.
S03E10,Mhysa,92,A wedding to plan. You must rest.
S03E10,Mhysa,93,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade"
S03E10,Mhysa,94,to help him sleep.
S03E10,Mhysa,95,I'm not tired!
S03E10,Mhysa,96,Come.
S03E10,Mhysa,97,Not you.
S03E10,Mhysa,98,You just sent the most powerful man
S03E10,Mhysa,99,in Westeros to bed without his supper.
S03E10,Mhysa,100,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
S03E10,Mhysa,101,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is King.
S03E10,Mhysa,102,You really think a crown gives you power?
S03E10,Mhysa,103,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,104,I think armies give you power.
S03E10,Mhysa,105,Mmm-hmm.
S03E10,Mhysa,106,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle,"
S03E10,Mhysa,107,and you defeated him all the same.
S03E10,Mhysa,108,Mmm-hmm.
S03E10,Mhysa,109,"Oh, I know."
S03E10,Mhysa,110,Walder Frey gets all the credit.
S03E10,Mhysa,111,"Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance."
S03E10,Mhysa,112,"Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?"
S03E10,Mhysa,113,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,114,He never would have risked such an action
S03E10,Mhysa,115,if he didn't have certain assurances.
S03E10,Mhysa,116,Which he got from me.
S03E10,Mhysa,117,Do you disapprove?
S03E10,Mhysa,118,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
S03E10,Mhysa,119,But to slaughter them at a wedding...
S03E10,Mhysa,120,Explain to me why it is more noble
S03E10,Mhysa,121,"to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner."
S03E10,Mhysa,122,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
S03E10,Mhysa,123,To end the war. To protect the family.
S03E10,Mhysa,124,Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?
S03E10,Mhysa,125,"Go ahead, write one."
S03E10,Mhysa,126,I'm in this world a little while longer
S03E10,Mhysa,127,"to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
S03E10,Mhysa,128,The Northerners will never forget.
S03E10,Mhysa,129,Good.
S03E10,Mhysa,130,Let them remember what happens when they march on the South.
S03E10,Mhysa,131,All the Stark men are dead.
S03E10,Mhysa,132,Winterfell is a ruin.
S03E10,Mhysa,133,Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North
S03E10,Mhysa,134,until your son by Sansa comes of age.
S03E10,Mhysa,135,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
S03E10,Mhysa,136,Do you think she'll open her legs for me
S03E10,Mhysa,137,after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
S03E10,Mhysa,138,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
S03E10,Mhysa,139,I will not rape her.
S03E10,Mhysa,140,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
S03E10,Mhysa,141,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
S03E10,Mhysa,142,The house that puts family first will always defeat
S03E10,Mhysa,143,the house that puts the whims and wishes
S03E10,Mhysa,144,of its sons and daughters first.
S03E10,Mhysa,145,A good man does everything in his power
S03E10,Mhysa,146,"to better his family's position,"
S03E10,Mhysa,147,regardless of his own selfish desires.
S03E10,Mhysa,148,Does that amuse you?
S03E10,Mhysa,149,"No, it's a very good lesson."
S03E10,Mhysa,150,Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family
S03E10,Mhysa,151,when you're making all the decisions.
S03E10,Mhysa,152,"Easy for me, is it?"
S03E10,Mhysa,153,"When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest,"
S03E10,Mhysa,154,but solely for the benefit of the family?
S03E10,Mhysa,155,The day that you were born.
S03E10,Mhysa,156,I wanted to carry you into the sea
S03E10,Mhysa,157,and let the waves wash you away.
S03E10,Mhysa,158,"Instead, I let you live."
S03E10,Mhysa,159,And I brought you up as my son.
S03E10,Mhysa,160,Because you're a Lannister.
S03E10,Mhysa,161,Sansa.
S03E10,Mhysa,162,It's empty.
S03E10,Mhysa,163,Let's find a place to sleep.
S03E10,Mhysa,164,Hodor.
S03E10,Mhysa,165,Hodor.
S03E10,Mhysa,166,"Don't, Hodor."
S03E10,Mhysa,167,Maybe we shouldn't stay here.
S03E10,Mhysa,168,You'd rather be out there?
S03E10,Mhysa,169,There are a lot of stories about this place.
S03E10,Mhysa,170,Horrible stories.
S03E10,Mhysa,171,I always quite liked the horrible stories.
S03E10,Mhysa,172,So did I. Once.
S03E10,Mhysa,173,You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
S03E10,Mhysa,174,No. Who's he?
S03E10,Mhysa,175,Just a cook in the Night's Watch.
S03E10,Mhysa,176,"He was angry at the King for something, I don't remember."
S03E10,Mhysa,177,"When the King was visiting the Nightfort,"
S03E10,Mhysa,178,"the cook killed the King's son,"
S03E10,Mhysa,179,"cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon."
S03E10,Mhysa,180,That night he served the pie to the King.
S03E10,Mhysa,181,"He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice."
S03E10,Mhysa,182,The Gods turned the cook into a giant white rat
S03E10,Mhysa,183,who could only eat his own young.
S03E10,Mhysa,184,"He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies."
S03E10,Mhysa,185,"But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
S03E10,Mhysa,186,If the Gods turned every killer into a giant white rat...
S03E10,Mhysa,187,It wasn't for murder the Gods cursed the Rat Cook
S03E10,Mhysa,188,or for serving the King's son in a pie.
S03E10,Mhysa,189,He killed a guest beneath his roof.
S03E10,Mhysa,190,That's something the Gods can't forgive.
S03E10,Mhysa,191,"""The late Walder Frey,"" old Tully called me"
S03E10,Mhysa,192,because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.
S03E10,Mhysa,193,He thought he was witty.
S03E10,Mhysa,194,"Look at us now, Tully."
S03E10,Mhysa,195,"You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,"
S03E10,Mhysa,196,"your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon,"
S03E10,Mhysa,197,and I'm Lord of Riverrun.
S03E10,Mhysa,198,The Blackfish escaped.
S03E10,Mhysa,199,An old man on the run with no allies.
S03E10,Mhysa,200,I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
S03E10,Mhysa,201,Who does he have?
S03E10,Mhysa,202,As you say.
S03E10,Mhysa,203,"They all laughed at me, all those high lords."
S03E10,Mhysa,204,They all thought they were better than me.
S03E10,Mhysa,205,"Ned Stark, Hoster Tully."
S03E10,Mhysa,206,"People snigger when I marry a young girl,"
S03E10,Mhysa,207,but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
S03E10,Mhysa,208,You'll be needing a new young girl.
S03E10,Mhysa,209,Yeah.
S03E10,Mhysa,210,Got that to look forward to.
S03E10,Mhysa,211,Hmm.
S03E10,Mhysa,212,"And you, the Warden of the North."
S03E10,Mhysa,213,No more Starks to bow and scrape to.
S03E10,Mhysa,214,Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
S03E10,Mhysa,215,He ignored my advice at every turn.
S03E10,Mhysa,216,If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...
S03E10,Mhysa,217,"Calling himself the ""Young Wolf."" How's that for pomposity?"
S03E10,Mhysa,218,"Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
S03E10,Mhysa,219,Forever young.
S03E10,Mhysa,220,Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
S03E10,Mhysa,221,At some point perhaps.
S03E10,Mhysa,222,But Winterfell's in ruins.
S03E10,Mhysa,223,Yeah.
S03E10,Mhysa,224,What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
S03E10,Mhysa,225,"I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
S03E10,Mhysa,226,I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.
S03E10,Mhysa,227,Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
S03E10,Mhysa,228,Oh. And?
S03E10,Mhysa,229,Ramsay delivered the terms.
S03E10,Mhysa,230,"The ironborn turned on Theon, as we knew they would."
S03E10,Mhysa,231,They handed him over trussed and hooded.
S03E10,Mhysa,232,"But Ramsay, well..."
S03E10,Mhysa,233,Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
S03E10,Mhysa,234,"Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
S03E10,Mhysa,235,What?
S03E10,Mhysa,236,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,237,Pork sausage.
S03E10,Mhysa,238,You think I'm some sort of savage?
S03E10,Mhysa,239,People talk about phantom limbs.
S03E10,Mhysa,240,An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.
S03E10,Mhysa,241,"So I've always wondered,"
S03E10,Mhysa,242,do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
S03E10,Mhysa,243,"Next time you think about naked girls,"
S03E10,Mhysa,244,will you feel an itch?
S03E10,Mhysa,245,Sorry.
S03E10,Mhysa,246,I shouldn't make jokes.
S03E10,Mhysa,247,My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
S03E10,Mhysa,248,But my father taught me to aim for their head.
S03E10,Mhysa,249,Kill me.
S03E10,Mhysa,250,"Sorry, what?"
S03E10,Mhysa,251,Kill me.
S03E10,Mhysa,252,A little louder.
S03E10,Mhysa,253,Kill me!
S03E10,Mhysa,254,You're no good to me dead. We need you.
S03E10,Mhysa,255,You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy any more.
S03E10,Mhysa,256,That's a name for a lord.
S03E10,Mhysa,257,"But you're not a lord, are you?"
S03E10,Mhysa,258,You're just meat.
S03E10,Mhysa,259,Stinking meat.
S03E10,Mhysa,260,You reek.
S03E10,Mhysa,261,Reek!
S03E10,Mhysa,262,That's a good name for you.
S03E10,Mhysa,263,What's your name?
S03E10,Mhysa,264,Theon Greyjoy.
S03E10,Mhysa,265,What's your name?
S03E10,Mhysa,266,Theon Greyjoy.
S03E10,Mhysa,267,Please.
S03E10,Mhysa,268,What is your name?
S03E10,Mhysa,269,Reek.
S03E10,Mhysa,270,My name is...
S03E10,Mhysa,271,Reek.
S03E10,Mhysa,272,Hodor.
S03E10,Mhysa,273,- Don't kill me! - Who are you?
S03E10,Mhysa,274,- Sam! Sam! - Who are you?
S03E10,Mhysa,275,Gilly. Don't hurt us.
S03E10,Mhysa,276,Where are you going?
S03E10,Mhysa,277,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
S03E10,Mhysa,278,"My brother, he's in the Night's..."
S03E10,Mhysa,279,- Who's your brother? - Doesn't matter.
S03E10,Mhysa,280,You're Jon's brother.
S03E10,Mhysa,281,The one who fell from the window.
S03E10,Mhysa,282,"No, I'm not."
S03E10,Mhysa,283,I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.
S03E10,Mhysa,284,And I've heard all about Hodor.
S03E10,Mhysa,285,Hodor.
S03E10,Mhysa,286,I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.
S03E10,Mhysa,287,"If you're his brother, you're my brother, too."
S03E10,Mhysa,288,"And anything I can do to help you, I will."
S03E10,Mhysa,289,Take us north of the Wall.
S03E10,Mhysa,290,What? Why in the world would you want to go...
S03E10,Mhysa,291,I don't want to. I have to.
S03E10,Mhysa,292,How did you get through the Wall?
S03E10,Mhysa,293,Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
S03E10,Mhysa,294,Come with us.
S03E10,Mhysa,295,There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.
S03E10,Mhysa,296,Hodor can carry you to the top.
S03E10,Mhysa,297,We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
S03E10,Mhysa,298,Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
S03E10,Mhysa,299,"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be."
S03E10,Mhysa,300,It's the safest place for you.
S03E10,Mhysa,301,There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
S03E10,Mhysa,302,What I know is what I saw.
S03E10,Mhysa,303,"And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
S03E10,Mhysa,304,You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
S03E10,Mhysa,305,How do you know all that?
S03E10,Mhysa,306,The Night's Watch can't stop them.
S03E10,Mhysa,307,The Kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
S03E10,Mhysa,308,But you're going to stop them?
S03E10,Mhysa,309,"Please, Sam."
S03E10,Mhysa,310,I have to go north.
S03E10,Mhysa,311,I have to.
S03E10,Mhysa,312,"""Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North."
S03E10,Mhysa,313,"""I give you until the full moon"
S03E10,Mhysa,314,"""to order all ironborn scum out of the North"
S03E10,Mhysa,315,"""and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
S03E10,Mhysa,316,"""On the first night of the full moon,"
S03E10,Mhysa,317,"""I will hunt down every islander"
S03E10,Mhysa,318,"""still in our lands and flay them living,"
S03E10,Mhysa,319,"""the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell."
S03E10,Mhysa,320,"""In the box you'll find a special gift..."
S03E10,Mhysa,321,"""Theon's favourite toy."
S03E10,Mhysa,322,"""He cried when I took it away from him."
S03E10,Mhysa,323,"""Leave the North now, or more boxes will follow"
S03E10,Mhysa,324,"""with more Theon."""
S03E10,Mhysa,325,"Signed, ""Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton,"
S03E10,Mhysa,326,"""Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."""
S03E10,Mhysa,327,Get that out of my sight.
S03E10,Mhysa,328,Theon disobeyed my orders.
S03E10,Mhysa,329,The boy is a fool.
S03E10,Mhysa,330,He cannot further the Greyjoy line.
S03E10,Mhysa,331,"I will not give up the lands I have seized,"
S03E10,Mhysa,332,the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me.
S03E10,Mhysa,333,He's your son.
S03E10,Mhysa,334,Son?
S03E10,Mhysa,335,He's not a man any more.
S03E10,Mhysa,336,He's your son. He's my brother.
S03E10,Mhysa,337,He's a Greyjoy.
S03E10,Mhysa,338,Watch yourself.
S03E10,Mhysa,339,I've made my decision.
S03E10,Mhysa,340,And I've made mine.
S03E10,Mhysa,341,I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
S03E10,Mhysa,342,I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.
S03E10,Mhysa,343,Get those ropes!
S03E10,Mhysa,344,"I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea,"
S03E10,Mhysa,345,all the way to the Weeping Water.
S03E10,Mhysa,346,I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.
S03E10,Mhysa,347,"I'm going to find my little brother,"
S03E10,Mhysa,348,and I'm going to bring him home.
S03E10,Mhysa,349,What is it?
S03E10,Mhysa,350,Dragonglass.
S03E10,Mhysa,351,We found them at the Fist.
S03E10,Mhysa,352,Someone buried them a long time ago.
S03E10,Mhysa,353,Someone wanted us to find them.
S03E10,Mhysa,354,Why? What are they for?
S03E10,Mhysa,355,Killing White Walkers.
S03E10,Mhysa,356,How do you know that?
S03E10,Mhysa,357,The Walker came for my baby.
S03E10,Mhysa,358,And Sam...
S03E10,Mhysa,359,But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
S03E10,Mhysa,360,"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
S03E10,Mhysa,361,"Take it, Hodor."
S03E10,Mhysa,362,And the archer.
S03E10,Mhysa,363,I got lucky with one of them.
S03E10,Mhysa,364,There are more.
S03E10,Mhysa,365,Many more.
S03E10,Mhysa,366,"And for every one of them,"
S03E10,Mhysa,367,"the dead men,"
S03E10,Mhysa,368,more than you could count.
S03E10,Mhysa,369,I wish you'd come with us.
S03E10,Mhysa,370,I wish I could.
S03E10,Mhysa,371,I really do.
S03E10,Mhysa,372,How are you keeping?
S03E10,Mhysa,373,Great. Never better.
S03E10,Mhysa,374,It was just a bit of blood.
S03E10,Mhysa,375,I should have known.
S03E10,Mhysa,376,"Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble."
S03E10,Mhysa,377,We're not really people to you.
S03E10,Mhysa,378,Just ways to get what you want.
S03E10,Mhysa,379,I'm not a highborn.
S03E10,Mhysa,380,"She called you ""Ser."""
S03E10,Mhysa,381,I heard it.
S03E10,Mhysa,382,A recent state of affairs.
S03E10,Mhysa,383,"I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you."
S03E10,Mhysa,384,"Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
S03E10,Mhysa,385,I lived below the Street of Flour.
S03E10,Mhysa,386,How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
S03E10,Mhysa,387,The shit that poured from their privy pipes
S03E10,Mhysa,388,"flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill,"
S03E10,Mhysa,389,along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door
S03E10,Mhysa,390,- on Gin Alley. - Gin Alley.
S03E10,Mhysa,391,"The Street of Steel, with your armour and your knights?"
S03E10,Mhysa,392,You lived in the fancy part of town.
S03E10,Mhysa,393,And here we are now.
S03E10,Mhysa,394,Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
S03E10,Mhysa,395,"Yeah, we've come a long way."
S03E10,Mhysa,396,"We're all the same, really."
S03E10,Mhysa,397,She went to great pains to point that out to me.
S03E10,Mhysa,398,"If you mistrust fancy people so much,"
S03E10,Mhysa,399,why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
S03E10,Mhysa,400,You're me.
S03E10,Mhysa,401,Never been with a woman.
S03E10,Mhysa,402,"Never talked to a woman, really."
S03E10,Mhysa,403,"And then she comes at you,"
S03E10,Mhysa,404,"big words, no clothes."
S03E10,Mhysa,405,What would you have done?
S03E10,Mhysa,406,"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
S03E10,Mhysa,407,So how'd you become a lord?
S03E10,Mhysa,408,Oh. That's a long story.
S03E10,Mhysa,409,"Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
S03E10,Mhysa,410,Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation.
S03E10,Mhysa,411,He rewarded me with a lordship.
S03E10,Mhysa,412,And this.
S03E10,Mhysa,413,You see?
S03E10,Mhysa,414,Highborns.
S03E10,Mhysa,415,I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
S03E10,Mhysa,416,Why did you?
S03E10,Mhysa,417,I did it for my son.
S03E10,Mhysa,418,I didn't want him to step over a river of shit
S03E10,Mhysa,419,every time he stepped through his front door.
S03E10,Mhysa,420,I wanted him to have a better life.
S03E10,Mhysa,421,Does he?
S03E10,Mhysa,422,He's dead.
S03E10,Mhysa,423,How'd he die?
S03E10,Mhysa,424,Following me.
S03E10,Mhysa,425,When did you come to this strange country?
S03E10,Mhysa,426,When I was 13.
S03E10,Mhysa,427,You were only a child.
S03E10,Mhysa,428,I stopped being a child when I was nine.
S03E10,Mhysa,429,My mother made sure of that.
S03E10,Mhysa,430,"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know."
S03E10,Mhysa,431,"He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night,"
S03E10,Mhysa,432,gamble away his father's money.
S03E10,Mhysa,433,Now it's just the drinking.
S03E10,Mhysa,434,And now I'm his wife's servant.
S03E10,Mhysa,435,I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
S03E10,Mhysa,436,She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
S03E10,Mhysa,437,I love that girl. I would kill for her.
S03E10,Mhysa,438,Do you think that makes it easier for me?
S03E10,Mhysa,439,"No, I expect not."
S03E10,Mhysa,440,She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
S03E10,Mhysa,441,"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family."
S03E10,Mhysa,442,"We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen."
S03E10,Mhysa,443,If you let yourself believe
S03E10,Mhysa,444,that a foreign girl with no name
S03E10,Mhysa,445,could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister...
S03E10,Mhysa,446,I have a name.
S03E10,Mhysa,447,You have one name.
S03E10,Mhysa,448,"As do I. Here, only the family name matters."
S03E10,Mhysa,449,"What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
S03E10,Mhysa,450,Diamonds.
S03E10,Mhysa,451,"I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth,"
S03E10,Mhysa,452,but you know how to protect yourself.
S03E10,Mhysa,453,Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.
S03E10,Mhysa,454,"You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house."
S03E10,Mhysa,455,Hire servants.
S03E10,Mhysa,456,"Start a new life, a good life, far from here."
S03E10,Mhysa,457,The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.
S03E10,Mhysa,458,Why do you want me to leave?
S03E10,Mhysa,459,Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive
S03E10,Mhysa,460,who could make this country a better place.
S03E10,Mhysa,461,"He has the mind, the will, and the right last name."
S03E10,Mhysa,462,"And you,"
S03E10,Mhysa,463,you are a complication.
S03E10,Mhysa,464,I know you love him.
S03E10,Mhysa,465,"And I know it's true love, not bought by gold and silver."
S03E10,Mhysa,466,I'm not asking you to leave him for money.
S03E10,Mhysa,467,I'm asking you to leave
S03E10,Mhysa,468,because your presence in the capital endangers him.
S03E10,Mhysa,469,"This will never be your home, my lady."
S03E10,Mhysa,470,"Find a true home somewhere far from here,"
S03E10,Mhysa,471,while there's still time.
S03E10,Mhysa,472,Lord Varys.
S03E10,Mhysa,473,"If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
S03E10,Mhysa,474,Keep up.
S03E10,Mhysa,475,"I don't think I can, my lord."
S03E10,Mhysa,476,It's not easy being drunk all the time.
S03E10,Mhysa,477,"Everyone would do it, if it were easy."
S03E10,Mhysa,478,Leave.
S03E10,Mhysa,479,"So, enjoying married life?"
S03E10,Mhysa,480,An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
S03E10,Mhysa,481,She doesn't deserve this.
S03E10,Mhysa,482,Deserve?
S03E10,Mhysa,483,Be careful with that.
S03E10,Mhysa,484,"Start trying to work out who deserves what,"
S03E10,Mhysa,485,and before long you'll spend your days
S03E10,Mhysa,486,weeping for every person in the world.
S03E10,Mhysa,487,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
S03E10,Mhysa,488,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras
S03E10,Mhysa,489,with the same philosophical spirit?
S03E10,Mhysa,490,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
S03E10,Mhysa,491,I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
S03E10,Mhysa,492,You're not me.
S03E10,Mhysa,493,You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
S03E10,Mhysa,494,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
S03E10,Mhysa,495,So she can have some happiness in her life.
S03E10,Mhysa,496,You have children.
S03E10,Mhysa,497,How happy would you say you are?
S03E10,Mhysa,498,Not very.
S03E10,Mhysa,499,"But if it weren't for my children,"
S03E10,Mhysa,500,I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.
S03E10,Mhysa,501,They're the reason I'm alive.
S03E10,Mhysa,502,Even Joffrey?
S03E10,Mhysa,503,Even Joffrey.
S03E10,Mhysa,504,He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born.
S03E10,Mhysa,505,I used to spend hours looking at him.
S03E10,Mhysa,506,His wisps of hair.
S03E10,Mhysa,507,His tiny little hands and feet.
S03E10,Mhysa,508,He was such a jolly little fellow.
S03E10,Mhysa,509,You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.
S03E10,Mhysa,510,"""We should have known. Even then we should have known."""
S03E10,Mhysa,511,It's nonsense.
S03E10,Mhysa,512,"Whenever he was with me, he was happy."
S03E10,Mhysa,513,"And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey,"
S03E10,Mhysa,514,how it feels to have someone.
S03E10,Mhysa,515,Someone of your own.
S03E10,Mhysa,516,How long does it go on?
S03E10,Mhysa,517,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
S03E10,Mhysa,518,"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
S03E10,Mhysa,519,Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
S03E10,Mhysa,520,"I'm telling you, that's what she did."
S03E10,Mhysa,521,Sounded like a cow in heat.
S03E10,Mhysa,522,"Aye, not for long."
S03E10,Mhysa,523,That's right.
S03E10,Mhysa,524,Black Walder shut her up right quick.
S03E10,Mhysa,525,None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
S03E10,Mhysa,526,"I'll tell you what, though."
S03E10,Mhysa,527,The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.
S03E10,Mhysa,528,You sewed it on?
S03E10,Mhysa,529,I did.
S03E10,Mhysa,530,"I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one."
S03E10,Mhysa,531,It was me.
S03E10,Mhysa,532,And Malcolm and Talbott.
S03E10,Mhysa,533,"Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time."
S03E10,Mhysa,534,Took the skin right with it.
S03E10,Mhysa,535,What we ended up having to do was hook the needle
S03E10,Mhysa,536,"right under the collarbone,"
S03E10,Mhysa,537,give it a nice firm mooring and...
S03E10,Mhysa,538,What do you want?
S03E10,Mhysa,539,Mind if I keep warm?
S03E10,Mhysa,540,Fuck off.
S03E10,Mhysa,541,But I'm hungry.
S03E10,Mhysa,542,"Does ""fuck off"" mean something different where you're from?"
S03E10,Mhysa,543,I've got money.
S03E10,Mhysa,544,What kind of coin is that?
S03E10,Mhysa,545,It's worth a lot.
S03E10,Mhysa,546,Sorry.
S03E10,Mhysa,547,Little shit.
S03E10,Mhysa,548,Fool!
S03E10,Mhysa,549,Where did you get the knife?
S03E10,Mhysa,550,From you.
S03E10,Mhysa,551,Is that the first man you've killed?
S03E10,Mhysa,552,The first man.
S03E10,Mhysa,553,"Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."
S03E10,Mhysa,554,Valar Morghulis.
S03E10,Mhysa,555,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice."
S03E10,Mhysa,556,"You always knew who I was, what I am."
S03E10,Mhysa,557,I have to go home now.
S03E10,Mhysa,558,I know you won't hurt me.
S03E10,Mhysa,559,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
S03E10,Mhysa,560,I do know some things.
S03E10,Mhysa,561,I know I love you.
S03E10,Mhysa,562,I know you love me.
S03E10,Mhysa,563,But I have to go home now.
S03E10,Mhysa,564,I know how this must look.
S03E10,Mhysa,565,What I meant was...
S03E10,Mhysa,566,"I swear to you, my lord..."
S03E10,Mhysa,567,"I'm not a lord, my dear."
S03E10,Mhysa,568,"Not for many, many years."
S03E10,Mhysa,569,Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles.
S03E10,Mhysa,570,Among other things.
S03E10,Mhysa,571,What is your name?
S03E10,Mhysa,572,Gilly.
S03E10,Mhysa,573,Ah.
S03E10,Mhysa,574,For the gillyflower. Lovely.
S03E10,Mhysa,575,"Yes, my..."
S03E10,Mhysa,576,Maester.
S03E10,Mhysa,577,Master.
S03E10,Mhysa,578,Maester.
S03E10,Mhysa,579,And the child?
S03E10,Mhysa,580,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
S03E10,Mhysa,581,His name is Sam.
S03E10,Mhysa,582,"Tarly,"
S03E10,Mhysa,583,do you remember the oath you swore
S03E10,Mhysa,584,when you joined this order?
S03E10,Mhysa,585,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon."
S03E10,Mhysa,586,She's one of Craster's wives.
S03E10,Mhysa,587,I remember every word of the oath.
S03E10,Mhysa,588,"""Night gathers and my watch begins."
S03E10,Mhysa,589,"""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."

S03E10,Mhysa,594,It's coming for all of us.
S03E10,Mhysa,595,"Gilly, you and your son"
S03E10,Mhysa,596,will be our guests for the time being.
S03E10,Mhysa,597,We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
S03E10,Mhysa,598,Thank you...
S03E10,Mhysa,599,Maester.
S03E10,Mhysa,600,I can cook and clean and I can...
S03E10,Mhysa,601,Good.
S03E10,Mhysa,602,"Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell."
S03E10,Mhysa,603,I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
S03E10,Mhysa,604,Miles better.
S03E10,Mhysa,605,We had 44 ravens at last count.

S03E10,Mhysa,619,My books are better than these boring scrolls.
S03E10,Mhysa,620,You could read about Balerion the Dread.
S03E10,Mhysa,621,They say you can still see his skull
S03E10,Mhysa,622,in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.
S03E10,Mhysa,623,I'd like to see that someday.

S03E10,Mhysa,637,Are we being attacked?
S03E10,Mhysa,638,Stay here. Bar the door.
S03E10,Mhysa,639,The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
S03E10,Mhysa,640,And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
S03E10,Mhysa,641,I take no credit.
S03E10,Mhysa,642,"I have faith, and my faith has been rewarded."
S03E10,Mhysa,643,"Your Grace, the world has got so far bent."
S03E10,Mhysa,644,"I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open."
S03E10,Mhysa,645,I don't know if Robb Stark died
S03E10,Mhysa,646,because of the Red Woman's sorcery
S03E10,Mhysa,647,"or because at war men die all the time,"
S03E10,Mhysa,648,but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms
S03E10,Mhysa,649,with blood magic is wrong. It is evil.
S03E10,Mhysa,650,And you are not an evil man.
S03E10,Mhysa,651,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
S03E10,Mhysa,652,Aegon Targaryen.
S03E10,Mhysa,653,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
S03E10,Mhysa,654,"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
S03E10,Mhysa,655,He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced
S03E10,Mhysa,656,"and a smaller army, but he had three dragons."
S03E10,Mhysa,657,"Dragons are magic, Ser Davos."
S03E10,Mhysa,658,My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.
S03E10,Mhysa,659,I will not forget that.
S03E10,Mhysa,660,I will not forgive that.
S03E10,Mhysa,661,I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
S03E10,Mhysa,662,You do not need to burn the boy.
S03E10,Mhysa,663,"If what you say is true,"
S03E10,Mhysa,664,a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark...
S03E10,Mhysa,665,And our King is still no closer to the Iron Throne.
S03E10,Mhysa,666,A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
S03E10,Mhysa,667,His name is Gendry. He's a good lad.
S03E10,Mhysa,668,"A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who happens to be your nephew."
S03E10,Mhysa,669,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
S03E10,Mhysa,670,Everything.
S03E10,Mhysa,671,The boy must die.
S03E10,Mhysa,672,- What are you doing? - You're leaving.
S03E10,Mhysa,673,Is this some kind of trick?
S03E10,Mhysa,674,"Yes, but not on you."
S03E10,Mhysa,675,Aim for that star. Don't stop.
S03E10,Mhysa,676,There's bread and water. Go slow with it.
S03E10,Mhysa,677,"If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get,"
S03E10,Mhysa,678,don't drink seawater.
S03E10,Mhysa,679,I know not to drink seawater.
S03E10,Mhysa,680,Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest.
S03E10,Mhysa,681,You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
S03E10,Mhysa,682,Where should I go?
S03E10,Mhysa,683,You must keep the coast on your left side
S03E10,Mhysa,684,until you reach King's Landing.
S03E10,Mhysa,685,The gold cloaks are looking for me.
S03E10,Mhysa,686,They were looking for me for 20 years.
S03E10,Mhysa,687,- Do they know your face? - No.
S03E10,Mhysa,688,I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
S03E10,Mhysa,689,The other way.
S03E10,Mhysa,690,You ever been in a boat before?
S03E10,Mhysa,691,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,692,You know how to swim?
S03E10,Mhysa,693,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,694,Don't fall out. Go on.
S03E10,Mhysa,695,Why are you doing this?
S03E10,Mhysa,696,Because it's right.
S03E10,Mhysa,697,And because I'm a slow learner.
S03E10,Mhysa,698,"When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
S03E10,Mhysa,699,Horse approaching!
S03E10,Mhysa,700,Halt! Halt!
S03E10,Mhysa,701,Jon! Jon!
S03E10,Mhysa,702,"Jon, it's us."
S03E10,Mhysa,703,I don't think he can see us.
S03E10,Mhysa,704,Pyp?
S03E10,Mhysa,705,Sam?
S03E10,Mhysa,706,"Hush, now. You're home."
S03E10,Mhysa,707,Carry him inside. Gently.
S03E10,Mhysa,708,Out of the way.
S03E10,Mhysa,709,"Step aside, country boy. People working here."
S03E10,Mhysa,710,Cersei.
S03E10,Mhysa,711,You don't deny it?
S03E10,Mhysa,712,No. I let him go.
S03E10,Mhysa,713,Your mercy saved the boy's life.
S03E10,Mhysa,714,You feel good about that?
S03E10,Mhysa,715,"Aye, I do."
S03E10,Mhysa,716,You saved one innocent.
S03E10,Mhysa,717,How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
S03E10,Mhysa,718,There has got to be another way.
S03E10,Mhysa,719,What other way? Tell us about this other way.
S03E10,Mhysa,720,"I don't know, Your Grace."
S03E10,Mhysa,721,I can't see the future in the fire.
S03E10,Mhysa,722,"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth."
S03E10,Mhysa,723,"I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,"
S03E10,Mhysa,724,"First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S03E10,Mhysa,725,sentence you to die.
S03E10,Mhysa,726,I understand.
S03E10,Mhysa,727,"But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King,"
S03E10,Mhysa,728,it is my duty to advise you against it.
S03E10,Mhysa,729,You're gonna need me.
S03E10,Mhysa,730,Take him away.
S03E10,Mhysa,731,Why am I gonna need you?
S03E10,Mhysa,732,My King.
S03E10,Mhysa,733,It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
S03E10,Mhysa,734,Their Lord Commander is dead.
S03E10,Mhysa,735,Took a ranging party north and never made it back.
S03E10,Mhysa,736,"One lad did, though."
S03E10,Mhysa,737,"What he saw beyond the Wall, it's coming for all of us."
S03E10,Mhysa,738,When did you learn to read?
S03E10,Mhysa,739,"Matthos taught me before he died,"
S03E10,Mhysa,740,so I could be of better service to you.
S03E10,Mhysa,741,This War of Five Kings means nothing.
S03E10,Mhysa,742,"The true war lies to the north, my King."
S03E10,Mhysa,743,Death marches on the Wall.
S03E10,Mhysa,744,Only you can stop him.
S03E10,Mhysa,745,You can't stop him alone.
S03E10,Mhysa,746,"You need someone to rebuild your army for you,"
S03E10,Mhysa,747,"someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you,"
S03E10,Mhysa,748,to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
S03E10,Mhysa,749,I've made my decision.
S03E10,Mhysa,750,He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
S03E10,Mhysa,751,"You see, Ser Davos?"
S03E10,Mhysa,752,You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock.
S03E10,Mhysa,753,You're in His army now.
S03E10,Mhysa,754,"They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
S03E10,Mhysa,755,Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
S03E10,Mhysa,756,You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
S03E10,Mhysa,757,People learn to love their chains.
S03E10,Mhysa,758,"This is Daenerys Targaryen,"
S03E10,Mhysa,759,"the Stormborn, the Unburnt,"
S03E10,Mhysa,760,"the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros,"
S03E10,Mhysa,761,the Mother of Dragons.
S03E10,Mhysa,762,It is to her you owe your freedom.
S03E10,Mhysa,763,No.
S03E10,Mhysa,764,You do not owe me your freedom.
S03E10,Mhysa,765,I cannot give it to you.
S03E10,Mhysa,766,Your freedom is not mine to give.
S03E10,Mhysa,767,It belongs to you and you alone.
S03E10,Mhysa,768,"If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves."

S03E10,Mhysa,783,- Mhysa. - Mhysa.
S03E10,Mhysa,784,- Mhysa. - Mhysa.
S03E10,Mhysa,785,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
S04E01,Two Swords,1,- Magnificent. - Mmm-hmm.
S04E01,Two Swords,2,Looks fresh-forged.
S04E01,Two Swords,3,It is.
S04E01,Two Swords,4,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
S04E01,Two Swords,5,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel.
S04E01,Two Swords,6,The finest of them was in Volantis.
S04E01,Two Swords,7,Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
S04E01,Two Swords,8,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
S04E01,Two Swords,9,From someone who no longer had need of it.
S04E01,Two Swords,10,You've wanted one in the family for a long time.
S04E01,Two Swords,11,- And now we have two. - Two?
S04E01,Two Swords,12,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
S04E01,Two Swords,13,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
S04E01,Two Swords,14,You'll have to train your left hand.
S04E01,Two Swords,15,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
S04E01,Two Swords,16,You'll never be as good.
S04E01,Two Swords,17,No.
S04E01,Two Swords,18,"But as long as I'm better than everyone else, it doesn't matter."
S04E01,Two Swords,19,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
S04E01,Two Swords,20,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
S04E01,Two Swords,21,The war is over. The King is safe.
S04E01,Two Swords,22,The King is never safe.
S04E01,Two Swords,23,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
S04E01,Two Swords,24,Other knights protected the King while you were a prisoner.
S04E01,Two Swords,25,They will continue to do so when you go home.
S04E01,Two Swords,26,Home?
S04E01,Two Swords,27,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
S04E01,Two Swords,28,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
S04E01,Two Swords,29,I am the King's Hand. My place is here.
S04E01,Two Swords,30,I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
S04E01,Two Swords,31,You know what they call me?
S04E01,Two Swords,32,Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honour.
S04E01,Two Swords,33,Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
S04E01,Two Swords,34,You won't be breaking anything.
S04E01,Two Swords,35,There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.
S04E01,Two Swords,36,The King will exercise that prerogative.
S04E01,Two Swords,37,No.
S04E01,Two Swords,38,No?
S04E01,Two Swords,39,No.
S04E01,Two Swords,40,- I don't believe I asked you a question. - There's my answer.
S04E01,Two Swords,41,If you think your bloody honour comes before your...
S04E01,Two Swords,42,"My bloody honour is beyond repair, but my answer is still no."
S04E01,Two Swords,43,"I don't want Casterly Rock, a wife, children."
S04E01,Two Swords,44,What do you want?
S04E01,Two Swords,45,Supper would be nice.
S04E01,Two Swords,46,For 40 years I've tried to teach you.
S04E01,Two Swords,47,"If you haven't learned by now, you never will."
S04E01,Two Swords,48,Go.
S04E01,Two Swords,49,"If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
S04E01,Two Swords,50,I suppose you want the sword back.
S04E01,Two Swords,51,Keep it.
S04E01,Two Swords,52,A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
S04E01,Two Swords,53,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
S04E01,Two Swords,54,Please don't.
S04E01,Two Swords,55,Seems to me the smart place to meet travellers is in a tavern.
S04E01,Two Swords,56,"That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
S04E01,Two Swords,57,"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
S04E01,Two Swords,58,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
S04E01,Two Swords,59,There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
S04E01,Two Swords,60,Has been for years.
S04E01,Two Swords,61,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood,"
S04E01,Two Swords,62,"- it may as well be yours, eh? - No need for cynicism."
S04E01,Two Swords,63,I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
S04E01,Two Swords,64,Oh.
S04E01,Two Swords,65,"Ah, here we are."
S04E01,Two Swords,66,Can you read the sigils?
S04E01,Two Swords,67,Yellow balls?
S04E01,Two Swords,68,"Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood."
S04E01,Two Swords,69,"A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House of Blackmont."
S04E01,Two Swords,70,"A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
S04E01,Two Swords,71,Boy knows his Dornish houses.
S04E01,Two Swords,72,I need a sigil.
S04E01,Two Swords,73,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
S04E01,Two Swords,74,"I don't see it, my lord."
S04E01,Two Swords,75,"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name."
S04E01,Two Swords,76,"My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well."
S04E01,Two Swords,77,"I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin."
S04E01,Two Swords,78,Forgive me.
S04E01,Two Swords,79,I don't see Prince Doran in your company.
S04E01,Two Swords,80,The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear.
S04E01,Two Swords,81,"He sends his brother, Prince Oberyn, to attend the royal wedding."
S04E01,Two Swords,82,The King will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior
S04E01,Two Swords,83,as renowned as Prince Oberyn.
S04E01,Two Swords,84,Will he?
S04E01,Two Swords,85,Where is Prince Oberyn?
S04E01,Two Swords,86,Arrived before dawn.
S04E01,Two Swords,87,Not a man for welcome parties.
S04E01,Two Swords,88,"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch"
S04E01,Two Swords,89,will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.
S04E01,Two Swords,90,You must be weary after such a long journey.
S04E01,Two Swords,91,Some accomplished diplomacy that was.
S04E01,Two Swords,92,Now where?
S04E01,Two Swords,93,"We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody, or several somebodies."
S04E01,Two Swords,94,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
S04E01,Two Swords,95,You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.
S04E01,Two Swords,96,You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad road.
S04E01,Two Swords,97,Where would you go?
S04E01,Two Swords,98,"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
S04E01,Two Swords,99,Look at this one.
S04E01,Two Swords,100,How lovely is she?
S04E01,Two Swords,101,Beautiful.
S04E01,Two Swords,102,But pale.
S04E01,Two Swords,103,We like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
S04E01,Two Swords,104,Do I frighten you?
S04E01,Two Swords,105,You like?
S04E01,Two Swords,106,Timid bores me.
S04E01,Two Swords,107,Hmm.
S04E01,Two Swords,108,"You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
S04E01,Two Swords,109,I think she likes you.
S04E01,Two Swords,110,She has good taste.
S04E01,Two Swords,111,"You're not timid, are you?"
S04E01,Two Swords,112,Not timid.
S04E01,Two Swords,113,Do you like women?
S04E01,Two Swords,114,"When they look like her, my lord."
S04E01,Two Swords,115,This one will do nicely.
S04E01,Two Swords,116,"Very good, my lady."
S04E01,Two Swords,117,"Oh, I'm not a lady."
S04E01,Two Swords,118,A term of courtesy in this establishment.
S04E01,Two Swords,119,A lie anywhere.
S04E01,Two Swords,120,Why not use the right words?
S04E01,Two Swords,121,I'm a bastard.
S04E01,Two Swords,122,She is a whore. And you're what?
S04E01,Two Swords,123,A procurer.
S04E01,Two Swords,124,Any of the others?
S04E01,Two Swords,125,The two girls can leave.
S04E01,Two Swords,126,You stay.
S04E01,Two Swords,127,"I'm afraid I'm not on offer, my lord."
S04E01,Two Swords,128,Everyone who works for Littlefinger is on offer.
S04E01,Two Swords,129,Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
S04E01,Two Swords,130,"- My lord. - I am a prince, boy."
S04E01,Two Swords,131,Have you ever been with a prince?
S04E01,Two Swords,132,Can't say I have.
S04E01,Two Swords,133,I'm wildly expensive.
S04E01,Two Swords,134,Take off your clothes.
S04E01,Two Swords,135,Which way do you like it?
S04E01,Two Swords,136,My way.
S04E01,Two Swords,137,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
S04E01,Two Swords,138,That Lord of Castamere
S04E01,Two Swords,139,But now the rains...
S04E01,Two Swords,140,Oberyn.
S04E01,Two Swords,141,Weep o'er his hall...
S04E01,Two Swords,142,"Oberyn, don't."
S04E01,Two Swords,143,With no one there to hear
S04E01,Two Swords,144,Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall
S04E01,Two Swords,145,And not a soul to hear
S04E01,Two Swords,146,"You lost, friend?"
S04E01,Two Swords,147,Forgive me for staring.
S04E01,Two Swords,148,I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
S04E01,Two Swords,149,I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
S04E01,Two Swords,150,We don't like the smell.
S04E01,Two Swords,151,"- Come with me, lover. - Gods, look at this one."
S04E01,Two Swords,152,"Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
S04E01,Two Swords,153,Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman?
S04E01,Two Swords,154,Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
S04E01,Two Swords,155,Hmm.
S04E01,Two Swords,156,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
S04E01,Two Swords,157,You think your gold
S04E01,Two Swords,158,and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone.
S04E01,Two Swords,159,May I tell you a secret?
S04E01,Two Swords,160,You're not a golden lion.
S04E01,Two Swords,161,You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
S04E01,Two Swords,162,Longsword is a bad option in close quarters.
S04E01,Two Swords,163,"When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding."
S04E01,Two Swords,164,"Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
S04E01,Two Swords,165,He'll live if you get him help straightaway.
S04E01,Two Swords,166,"So, decisions."
S04E01,Two Swords,167,"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
S04E01,Two Swords,168,...trouble.
S04E01,Two Swords,169,"Apologies, my love."
S04E01,Two Swords,170,I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
S04E01,Two Swords,171,"Ellaria Sand, my paramour."
S04E01,Two Swords,172,The King's own Uncle Imp.
S04E01,Two Swords,173,"Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
S04E01,Two Swords,174,If there's anything I can do to make your stay at King's Landing...
S04E01,Two Swords,175,What are you? His hired killer?
S04E01,Two Swords,176,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
S04E01,Two Swords,177,How did that come to pass?
S04E01,Two Swords,178,Killed the right people.
S04E01,Two Swords,179,"We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
S04E01,Two Swords,180,You don't partake?
S04E01,Two Swords,181,"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
S04E01,Two Swords,182,"Prince Oberyn, a word in private?"
S04E01,Two Swords,183,Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
S04E01,Two Swords,184,"- Oh, they take all kinds. - Even Dornishmen."
S04E01,Two Swords,185,The King is very grateful that you travelled all this way for his wedding.
S04E01,Two Swords,186,Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted.
S04E01,Two Swords,187,I am only the second son.
S04E01,Two Swords,188,"Well, speaking as a fellow second son,"
S04E01,Two Swords,189,I have grown rather used to being the family insult.
S04E01,Two Swords,190,Why did you come to King's Landing?
S04E01,Two Swords,191,I was invited to the royal wedding.
S04E01,Two Swords,192,I thought we were speaking truth.
S04E01,Two Swords,193,The last time I was in the capital was many years ago.
S04E01,Two Swords,194,Another wedding.
S04E01,Two Swords,195,"My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon."
S04E01,Two Swords,196,My sister loved him. She bore his children.
S04E01,Two Swords,197,"Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast."
S04E01,Two Swords,198,Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.
S04E01,Two Swords,199,"And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen"
S04E01,Two Swords,200,left her for another woman.
S04E01,Two Swords,201,"That started a war, and the war ended right here,"
S04E01,Two Swords,202,when your father's army took the city.
S04E01,Two Swords,203,I wasn't actually present.
S04E01,Two Swords,204,They butchered those children.
S04E01,Two Swords,205,My nephew and niece.
S04E01,Two Swords,206,Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.
S04E01,Two Swords,207,"And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
S04E01,Two Swords,208,I'm asking you a question.
S04E01,Two Swords,209,- I've heard rumours. - Hmm.
S04E01,Two Swords,210,So have I.
S04E01,Two Swords,211,The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain
S04E01,Two Swords,212,raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
S04E01,Two Swords,213,I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
S04E01,Two Swords,214,"If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order."
S04E01,Two Swords,215,Tell your father I'm here.
S04E01,Two Swords,216,And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.
S04E01,Two Swords,217,"They're dragons, Khaleesi."
S04E01,Two Swords,218,They can never be tamed.
S04E01,Two Swords,219,Not even by their mother.
S04E01,Two Swords,220,Ser Barristan.
S04E01,Two Swords,221,Your Grace.
S04E01,Two Swords,222,Where's Daario Naharis?
S04E01,Two Swords,223,Where's Grey Worm?
S04E01,Two Swords,224,"Gambling, Your Grace."
S04E01,Two Swords,225,Gambling?
S04E01,Two Swords,226,Mhysa. Mhysa.
S04E01,Two Swords,227,How long have they been at it?
S04E01,Two Swords,228,"Since midnight, Your Grace."
S04E01,Two Swords,229,Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.
S04E01,Two Swords,230,But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
S04E01,Two Swords,231,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
S04E01,Two Swords,232,The honour of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
S04E01,Two Swords,233,"That honour goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan,"
S04E01,Two Swords,234,as neither of them kept me waiting this morning.
S04E01,Two Swords,235,You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
S04E01,Two Swords,236,The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
S04E01,Two Swords,237,You like this girl?
S04E01,Two Swords,238,Must be frustrating.
S04E01,Two Swords,239,"You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
S04E01,Two Swords,240,I'd rather have no brains
S04E01,Two Swords,241,and two balls.
S04E01,Two Swords,242,You need to eat something.
S04E01,Two Swords,243,Pigeon pie.
S04E01,Two Swords,244,"No, thank you."
S04E01,Two Swords,245,Lemon cakes?
S04E01,Two Swords,246,"No, thank you."
S04E01,Two Swords,247,You love lemon cakes.
S04E01,Two Swords,248,Tell her she needs to eat.
S04E01,Two Swords,249,"My lady, you do need to eat."
S04E01,Two Swords,250,I don't want to eat.
S04E01,Two Swords,251,If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
S04E01,Two Swords,252,She needs to eat.
S04E01,Two Swords,253,I can't let you starve.
S04E01,Two Swords,254,I swore to protect you.
S04E01,Two Swords,255,"My lady,"
S04E01,Two Swords,256,I am your husband. Let me help you.
S04E01,Two Swords,257,How can you help me?
S04E01,Two Swords,258,"I don't know, but I can try."
S04E01,Two Swords,259,"I lie awake all night staring at the canopy,"
S04E01,Two Swords,260,thinking about how they died.
S04E01,Two Swords,261,I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
S04E01,Two Swords,262,Do you know what they did to my brother?
S04E01,Two Swords,263,How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body?
S04E01,Two Swords,264,And my mother.
S04E01,Two Swords,265,They cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
S04E01,Two Swords,266,What happened to your family was a terrible crime.
S04E01,Two Swords,267,I didn't know your brother.
S04E01,Two Swords,268,"He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him."
S04E01,Two Swords,269,"Your mother, I admired her."
S04E01,Two Swords,270,"She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her."
S04E01,Two Swords,271,She was a strong woman.
S04E01,Two Swords,272,And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children.
S04E01,Two Swords,273,Sansa.
S04E01,Two Swords,274,Your mother would want you to carry on.
S04E01,Two Swords,275,You know it's true.
S04E01,Two Swords,276,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
S04E01,Two Swords,277,"Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
S04E01,Two Swords,278,I don't pray any more.
S04E01,Two Swords,279,It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
S04E01,Two Swords,280,My lion.
S04E01,Two Swords,281,What are you doing?
S04E01,Two Swords,282,What does it look like?
S04E01,Two Swords,283,Come here.
S04E01,Two Swords,284,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
S04E01,Two Swords,285,I know. We have come to a dangerous place.
S04E01,Two Swords,286,Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
S04E01,Two Swords,287,Of course I haven't forgotten.
S04E01,Two Swords,288,I want you.
S04E01,Two Swords,289,Don't you want me?
S04E01,Two Swords,290,Things are a bit tense right now.
S04E01,Two Swords,291,What things?
S04E01,Two Swords,292,My nephew the King wants to murder me.
S04E01,Two Swords,293,My wife hates me because my father murdered her family.
S04E01,Two Swords,294,Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
S04E01,Two Swords,295,You need to relax.
S04E01,Two Swords,296,Don't you want to relax?
S04E01,Two Swords,297,- What's wrong? - I told you.
S04E01,Two Swords,298,- It's not a good time. - It's never a good time.
S04E01,Two Swords,299,- You have your child bride now. - Shae.
S04E01,Two Swords,300,Do you love her?
S04E01,Two Swords,301,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
S04E01,Two Swords,302,That's not an answer.
S04E01,Two Swords,303,I don't love her.
S04E01,Two Swords,304,You tried to ship me away.
S04E01,Two Swords,305,Ship you away?
S04E01,Two Swords,306,Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
S04E01,Two Swords,307,What are you talking about?
S04E01,Two Swords,308,"If you want me to leave, just say it."
S04E01,Two Swords,309,- Say it! - Shh.
S04E01,Two Swords,310,I don't know what you're talking about.
S04E01,Two Swords,311,You want me to stay?
S04E01,Two Swords,312,A work of art.
S04E01,Two Swords,313,The craftsmanship is excellent.
S04E01,Two Swords,314,"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
S04E01,Two Swords,315,You're such an ingrate.
S04E01,Two Swords,316,I spent days with the goldsmith getting the details just right.
S04E01,Two Swords,317,Days?
S04E01,Two Swords,318,Better part of an afternoon.
S04E01,Two Swords,319,"There, how does that feel?"
S04E01,Two Swords,320,Uh...
S04E01,Two Swords,321,A hook would be more practical.
S04E01,Two Swords,322,"Elegant, I think."
S04E01,Two Swords,323,CERSEl: Thank you for your help with the other matter.
S04E01,Two Swords,324,- The symptoms have abated? - Gone completely.
S04E01,Two Swords,325,"I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
S04E01,Two Swords,326,"Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can."
S04E01,Two Swords,327,- Odd little man. - I've grown fond of him.
S04E01,Two Swords,328,He's quite talented.
S04E01,Two Swords,329,What symptoms?
S04E01,Two Swords,330,Symptoms that are not your concern.
S04E01,Two Swords,331,You let him touch you?
S04E01,Two Swords,332,You jealous?
S04E01,Two Swords,333,I'm surprised.
S04E01,Two Swords,334,You never let Pycelle near you.
S04E01,Two Swords,335,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me?
S04E01,Two Swords,336,He smells like a dead cat.
S04E01,Two Swords,337,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
S04E01,Two Swords,338,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
S04E01,Two Swords,339,You drink more than you used to.
S04E01,Two Swords,340,- Yes. - Why?
S04E01,Two Swords,341,Hmm. Let's see.
S04E01,Two Swords,342,You started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.
S04E01,Two Swords,343,My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.
S04E01,Two Swords,344,It must have been traumatic for you.
S04E01,Two Swords,345,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.
S04E01,Two Swords,346,We suffered through a siege.
S04E01,Two Swords,347,A rather short siege.
S04E01,Two Swords,348,That I didn't expect to survive.
S04E01,Two Swords,349,"And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden,"
S04E01,Two Swords,350,"while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow-biter. So..."
S04E01,Two Swords,351,Father disowned me today.
S04E01,Two Swords,352,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
S04E01,Two Swords,353,You're forgetting Tyrion.
S04E01,Two Swords,354,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
S04E01,Two Swords,355,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
S04E01,Two Swords,356,- Not now. - I want...
S04E01,Two Swords,357,Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
S04E01,Two Swords,358,- Something's changed. - Everything's changed.
S04E01,Two Swords,359,You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand
S04E01,Two Swords,360,and expect everything to be the same?
S04E01,Two Swords,361,What do you want me to apologise for?
S04E01,Two Swords,362,For leaving me.
S04E01,Two Swords,363,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
S04E01,Two Swords,364,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here.
S04E01,Two Swords,365,You left me alone.
S04E01,Two Swords,366,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape."
S04E01,Two Swords,367,Every day.
S04E01,Two Swords,368,I murdered people so I could be here with you.
S04E01,Two Swords,369,- You took too long. - I...
S04E01,Two Swords,370,- What are you saying? - You took too long.
S04E01,Two Swords,371,- Come in. - Go away.
S04E01,Two Swords,372,"Forgive me, Your Grace."
S04E01,Two Swords,373,You told me to come at once if there was anything important.
S04E01,Two Swords,374,You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
S04E01,Two Swords,375,"Do you plan on sitting here, scratching your balls till winter?"
S04E01,Two Swords,376,We wait for Mance's orders.
S04E01,Two Swords,377,You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon.
S04E01,Two Swords,378,"If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
S04E01,Two Swords,379,And what is it you want?
S04E01,Two Swords,380,March on Castle Black with just this lot?
S04E01,Two Swords,381,Your pretty crow said a thousand men are nesting there.
S04E01,Two Swords,382,He's a liar.
S04E01,Two Swords,383,He is?
S04E01,Two Swords,384,"Shouldn't it be ""he was""?"
S04E01,Two Swords,385,You said you put three arrows in him.
S04E01,Two Swords,386,I did.
S04E01,Two Swords,387,I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.
S04E01,Two Swords,388,"If that boy's still walking,"
S04E01,Two Swords,389,it's 'cause you let him go.
S04E01,Two Swords,390,Thenns.
S04E01,Two Swords,391,I fucking hate Thenns.
S04E01,Two Swords,392,Mance sent you?
S04E01,Two Swords,393,How did you find us?
S04E01,Two Swords,394,"You came from the south, not the north."
S04E01,Two Swords,395,Took a detour.
S04E01,Two Swords,396,Got some supper from a village down that way.
S04E01,Two Swords,397,Why does the meat down here taste so much better
S04E01,Two Swords,398,than it does on our side of the Wall?
S04E01,Two Swords,399,Help yourself.
S04E01,Two Swords,400,Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
S04E01,Two Swords,401,Fat and lazy.
S04E01,Two Swords,402,Easier for us.
S04E01,Two Swords,403,You didn't see us coming?
S04E01,Two Swords,404,Lost your warg?
S04E01,Two Swords,405,"And that baby crow you had with you,"
S04E01,Two Swords,406,"lost him, too?"
S04E01,Two Swords,407,I'll answer to Mance.
S04E01,Two Swords,408,I won't answer to you.
S04E01,Two Swords,409,She yours?
S04E01,Two Swords,410,I'm not anybody's.
S04E01,Two Swords,411,Too scrawny.
S04E01,Two Swords,412,Not like those crows at Castle Black.
S04E01,Two Swords,413,"Think of them stuck in their larders,"
S04E01,Two Swords,414,stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage
S04E01,Two Swords,415,"and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
S04E01,Two Swords,416,"I know we've had our differences, Tormund,"
S04E01,Two Swords,417,"but just one time before you die,"
S04E01,Two Swords,418,you really ought to try crow.
S04E01,Two Swords,419,Draw.
S04E01,Two Swords,420,Loose.
S04E01,Two Swords,421,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell."
S04E01,Two Swords,422,"He said, ""Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."""
S04E01,Two Swords,423,I was jealous of Robb my whole life.
S04E01,Two Swords,424,"The way my father looked at him, I wanted that."
S04E01,Two Swords,425,He was better than me at everything.
S04E01,Two Swords,426,Fighting and hunting
S04E01,Two Swords,427,and riding
S04E01,Two Swords,428,and girls.
S04E01,Two Swords,429,"Gods, the girls loved him."
S04E01,Two Swords,430,"I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
S04E01,Two Swords,431,Sometimes I want to hate you.
S04E01,Two Swords,432,You're better than me at everything.
S04E01,Two Swords,433,Except reading.
S04E01,Two Swords,434,"They're, um..."
S04E01,Two Swords,435,They're ready for you.
S04E01,Two Swords,436,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
S04E01,Two Swords,437,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
S04E01,Two Swords,438,I've done plenty wrong.
S04E01,Two Swords,439,So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
S04E01,Two Swords,440,- I didn't murder him. - No?
S04E01,Two Swords,441,You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch.
S04E01,Two Swords,442,What do you call that?
S04E01,Two Swords,443,He wanted me to kill him.
S04E01,Two Swords,444,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
S04E01,Two Swords,445,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
S04E01,Two Swords,446,Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
S04E01,Two Swords,447,Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall.
S04E01,Two Swords,448,"The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
S04E01,Two Swords,449,The free folk? Listen to him.
S04E01,Two Swords,450,He even talks like a wildling now.
S04E01,Two Swords,451,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings."
S04E01,Two Swords,452,I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I...
S04E01,Two Swords,453,I laid with a wildling girl.
S04E01,Two Swords,454,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
S04E01,Two Swords,455,I do.
S04E01,Two Swords,456,The law is the law.
S04E01,Two Swords,457,The boy must die.
S04E01,Two Swords,458,"If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl,"
S04E01,Two Swords,459,the Wall would be manned by headless men.
S04E01,Two Swords,460,There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel
S04E01,Two Swords,461,and sleeping with the enemy.
S04E01,Two Swords,462,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke,"
S04E01,Two Swords,463,"Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
S04E01,Two Swords,464,Impossible.
S04E01,Two Swords,465,You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
S04E01,Two Swords,466,"100,000."
S04E01,Two Swords,467,"He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans."
S04E01,Two Swords,468,He has giants fighting for him.
S04E01,Two Swords,469,Giants?
S04E01,Two Swords,470,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
S04E01,Two Swords,471,"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
S04E01,Two Swords,472,And now you're here.
S04E01,Two Swords,473,You must not have been very good at your job.
S04E01,Two Swords,474,How dare you?
S04E01,Two Swords,475,"There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already, led by Tormund Giantsbane."
S04E01,Two Swords,476,I killed their warg and three others.
S04E01,Two Swords,477,They shot me full of arrows.
S04E01,Two Swords,478,Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north.
S04E01,Two Swords,479,The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.
S04E01,Two Swords,480,Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen.
S04E01,Two Swords,481,That's the truth.
S04E01,Two Swords,482,All the truth.
S04E01,Two Swords,483,"Do you intend to execute me, or am I free to go?"
S04E01,Two Swords,484,None of us are free.
S04E01,Two Swords,485,We are men of the Night's Watch.
S04E01,Two Swords,486,"But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow."
S04E01,Two Swords,487,Go on.
S04E01,Two Swords,488,"I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon."
S04E01,Two Swords,489,"Yes, you are."
S04E01,Two Swords,490,And I don't trust the bastard.
S04E01,Two Swords,491,He told the truth.
S04E01,Two Swords,492,And you always know when a man's telling a lie?
S04E01,Two Swords,493,How did you acquire this magical power?
S04E01,Two Swords,494,I grew up in King's Landing.
S04E01,Two Swords,495,No.
S04E01,Two Swords,496,"You're a queen, not an ox."
S04E01,Two Swords,497,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
S04E01,Two Swords,498,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother."
S04E01,Two Swords,499,You can't say no to everything.
S04E01,Two Swords,500,"Nonsense. My little dears,"
S04E01,Two Swords,501,go and speak to the jewellers of King's Landing.
S04E01,Two Swords,502,"Tell them who you are, who sent you."
S04E01,Two Swords,503,The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.
S04E01,Two Swords,504,The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the Sept a fortnight from now
S04E01,Two Swords,505,will inspire a thousand songs.
S04E01,Two Swords,506,How sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.
S04E01,Two Swords,507,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me.
S04E01,Two Swords,508,End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
S04E01,Two Swords,509,"You watch that. Even here, with me."
S04E01,Two Swords,510,My word.
S04E01,Two Swords,511,My lady.
S04E01,Two Swords,512,Please pardon me for interrupting.
S04E01,Two Swords,513,My name is Brienne of Tarth.
S04E01,Two Swords,514,We know who you are. We've heard all about you.
S04E01,Two Swords,515,But hearing is one thing.
S04E01,Two Swords,516,Aren't you just marvellous!
S04E01,Two Swords,517,Absolutely singular.
S04E01,Two Swords,518,"I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt, like the silly little boy he is."
S04E01,Two Swords,519,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
S04E01,Two Swords,520,You dare not refuse.
S04E01,Two Swords,521,A shadow?
S04E01,Two Swords,522,With the face of Stannis Baratheon.
S04E01,Two Swords,523,I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis.
S04E01,Two Swords,524,He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared.
S04E01,Two Swords,525,"One day, I will avenge our king."
S04E01,Two Swords,526,Joffrey is our king now.
S04E01,Two Swords,527,- I meant no offence. - And you've given none.
S04E01,Two Swords,528,All the Kingsguard will be on duty.
S04E01,Two Swords,529,Ser Boros will be stationed here.
S04E01,Two Swords,530,"Ser Preston will be stationed here, beside the primary entertainment."
S04E01,Two Swords,531,- Your Grace? - Huh?
S04E01,Two Swords,532,One guard at the thing. Go on.
S04E01,Two Swords,533,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
S04E01,Two Swords,534,"I've always guarded the King himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
S04E01,Two Swords,535,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn."
S04E01,Two Swords,536,All very good. I don't expect any trouble.
S04E01,Two Swords,537,The people love their King. They know who keeps them fed.
S04E01,Two Swords,538,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
S04E01,Two Swords,539,By my leave.
S04E01,Two Swords,540,They know I saved the city. I won the war.
S04E01,Two Swords,541,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
S04E01,Two Swords,542,I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.
S04E01,Two Swords,543,"Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
S04E01,Two Swords,544,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
S04E01,Two Swords,545,Busy getting captured.
S04E01,Two Swords,546,So this is the famous Book of Brothers?
S04E01,Two Swords,547,All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard.
S04E01,Two Swords,548,Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning.
S04E01,Two Swords,549,Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood.
S04E01,Two Swords,550,Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat.
S04E01,Two Swords,551,Ser Duncan the Tall.
S04E01,Two Swords,552,Four pages.
S04E01,Two Swords,553,- He must have been quite a man. - So they say.
S04E01,Two Swords,554,Ser Jaime Lannister.
S04E01,Two Swords,555,Hmm.
S04E01,Two Swords,556,Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
S04E01,Two Swords,557,- There's still time. - Is there?
S04E01,Two Swords,558,For a 40-year-old knight with one hand?
S04E01,Two Swords,559,How can you protect me with that?
S04E01,Two Swords,560,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace."
S04E01,Two Swords,561,Makes for more of a contest.
S04E01,Two Swords,562,Have you ever been to Meereen?
S04E01,Two Swords,563,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
S04E01,Two Swords,564,And?
S04E01,Two Swords,565,They say a thousand slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
S04E01,Two Swords,566,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates.
S04E01,Two Swords,567,You think the Great Masters are worried?
S04E01,Two Swords,568,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
S04E01,Two Swords,569,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
S04E01,Two Swords,570,"Yes, My Queen."
S04E01,Two Swords,571,But I need to speak to you about something important.
S04E01,Two Swords,572,A matter of strategy.
S04E01,Two Swords,573,Your Grace.
S04E01,Two Swords,574,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
S04E01,Two Swords,575,A dusk rose.
S04E01,Two Swords,576,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
S04E01,Two Swords,577,And this one's called lady's lace.
S04E01,Two Swords,578,Would you like to walk without shoes?
S04E01,Two Swords,579,You have to know a land to rule it.
S04E01,Two Swords,580,"Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its people."
S04E01,Two Swords,581,Dusk rose tea eases fever.
S04E01,Two Swords,582,Everyone in Meereen knows that.
S04E01,Two Swords,583,Especially the slaves who have to make the tea.
S04E01,Two Swords,584,"If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world."
S04E01,Two Swords,585,Strategy.
S04E01,Two Swords,586,Harpy's Gold.
S04E01,Two Swords,587,No tea from this one.
S04E01,Two Swords,588,Beautiful but poisonous.
S04E01,Two Swords,589,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
S04E01,Two Swords,590,Your Grace.
S04E01,Two Swords,591,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
S04E01,Two Swords,592,How many miles are there?
S04E01,Two Swords,593,"163, Your Grace."
S04E01,Two Swords,594,I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them.
S04E01,Two Swords,595,You don't need to see this.
S04E01,Two Swords,596,You will do no such thing.
S04E01,Two Swords,597,I will see each and every one of their faces.
S04E01,Two Swords,598,Remove her collar before you bury her.
S04E01,Two Swords,599,There she is.
S04E01,Two Swords,600,Yes.
S04E01,Two Swords,601,- And? - You made a promise.
S04E01,Two Swords,602,"To return the Stark girls to their mother, who is now dead."
S04E01,Two Swords,603,To keep them safe.
S04E01,Two Swords,604,Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed.
S04E01,Two Swords,605,Where do you think she is? My money's on dead.
S04E01,Two Swords,606,"There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say?"
S04E01,Two Swords,607,And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.
S04E01,Two Swords,608,Bit of a complication.
S04E01,Two Swords,609,A complication does not release you from a vow.
S04E01,Two Swords,610,What do you want me to do?
S04E01,Two Swords,611,Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
S04E01,Two Swords,612,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
S04E01,Two Swords,613,Are you sure we're not related?
S04E01,Two Swords,614,"Ever since I've returned,"
S04E01,Two Swords,615,every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass.
S04E01,Two Swords,616,"Maybe you're a Lannister, too."
S04E01,Two Swords,617,"You've got the hair for it, if not the looks."
S04E01,Two Swords,618,It's all right.
S04E01,Two Swords,619,- You're drunk. - Yes.
S04E01,Two Swords,620,I have good reason to be.
S04E01,Two Swords,621,Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool.
S04E01,Two Swords,622,Don't you know me?
S04E01,Two Swords,623,Ser Dontos. The King's nameday celebration.
S04E01,Two Swords,624,I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
S04E01,Two Swords,625,I can't accept your apology.
S04E01,Two Swords,626,"I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
S04E01,Two Swords,627,Anyone would have done the same.
S04E01,Two Swords,628,But only you did.
S04E01,Two Swords,629,I can never repay you. You gave me my life.
S04E01,Two Swords,630,But this is worth more than my life.
S04E01,Two Swords,631,"It belonged to my mother, and her mother before her."
S04E01,Two Swords,632,House Hollard was strong once.
S04E01,Two Swords,633,House on the rise.
S04E01,Two Swords,634,"That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
S04E01,Two Swords,635,I can't take it.
S04E01,Two Swords,636,"It's very kind of you, but I can't."
S04E01,Two Swords,637,I don't have anything else left.
S04E01,Two Swords,638,That's all.
S04E01,Two Swords,639,Take it. Wear it.
S04E01,Two Swords,640,Let my name have one more moment in the sun
S04E01,Two Swords,641,before it disappears from the world.
S04E01,Two Swords,642,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
S04E01,Two Swords,643,Yeah.
S04E01,Two Swords,644,When am I going to get a horse of my own?
S04E01,Two Swords,645,The little lady wants a pony.
S04E01,Two Swords,646,The little lady wants away from your stench.
S04E01,Two Swords,647,Horses aren't easy to come by.
S04E01,Two Swords,648,"Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse?"
S04E01,Two Swords,649,Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?
S04E01,Two Swords,650,Why don't you have any money?
S04E01,Two Swords,651,Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
S04E01,Two Swords,652,No.
S04E01,Two Swords,653,"You're not very smart, are you?"
S04E01,Two Swords,654,I'm not a thief.
S04E01,Two Swords,655,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
S04E01,Two Swords,656,A man's got to have a code.
S04E01,Two Swords,657,You think I'm gonna escape?
S04E01,Two Swords,658,Where would I go?
S04E01,Two Swords,659,I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
S04E01,Two Swords,660,You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa.
S04E01,Two Swords,661,"After I sell you to her,"
S04E01,Two Swords,662,maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.
S04E01,Two Swords,663,I'm hungry. You're hungry.
S04E01,Two Swords,664,"Five horses, five men."
S04E01,Two Swords,665,More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.
S04E01,Two Swords,666,I know him.
S04E01,Two Swords,667,The small one. His name is Polliver.
S04E01,Two Swords,668,He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
S04E01,Two Swords,669,He killed Lommy.
S04E01,Two Swords,670,What the fuck's a Lommy?
S04E01,Two Swords,671,He was my friend.
S04E01,Two Swords,672,Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.
S04E01,Two Swords,673,He's still got it.
S04E01,Two Swords,674,Got what?
S04E01,Two Swords,675,My sword Needle.
S04E01,Two Swords,676,Needle?
S04E01,Two Swords,677,Of course you named your sword.
S04E01,Two Swords,678,Lots of people name their swords.
S04E01,Two Swords,679,Lots of cunts.
S04E01,Two Swords,680,What are you... Get back...
S04E01,Two Swords,681,My brother gave me that sword.
S04E01,Two Swords,682,- Get back here. - He killed my friend.
S04E01,Two Swords,683,I don't care if he ate your friend.
S04E01,Two Swords,684,We're not going in there.
S04E01,Two Swords,685,"Come on, give it up."
S04E01,Two Swords,686,Come here.
S04E01,Two Swords,687,"- Let's have a feel, eh? - Leave it."
S04E01,Two Swords,688,Come here.
S04E01,Two Swords,689,"Please, she's a good girl."
S04E01,Two Swords,690,"Shut your mouth and pour us more ale,"
S04E01,Two Swords,691,and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
S04E01,Two Swords,692,I know you.
S04E01,Two Swords,693,You're the Hound.
S04E01,Two Swords,694,Pour our new friend some ale.
S04E01,Two Swords,695,What brings you so far north?
S04E01,Two Swords,696,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
S04E01,Two Swords,697,Just keeping the King's peace.
S04E01,Two Swords,698,No need. The war's over.
S04E01,Two Swords,699,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.
S04E01,Two Swords,700,Robb Stark killed at the Twins.
S04E01,Two Swords,701,And where am I for all of it?
S04E01,Two Swords,702,Stuck with your brother.
S04E01,Two Swords,703,- Meaning no offence. - None taken.
S04E01,Two Swords,704,"He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does."
S04E01,Two Swords,705,"But torture, torture."
S04E01,Two Swords,706,"You spend enough time putting the hammer to people,"
S04E01,Two Swords,707,you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs.
S04E01,Two Swords,708,Drains the fun right out of it.
S04E01,Two Swords,709,And what's life without a little fun?
S04E01,Two Swords,710,"But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
S04E01,Two Swords,711,She's all right. I've had better.
S04E01,Two Swords,712,You know what?
S04E01,Two Swords,713,You should come with us.
S04E01,Two Swords,714,"His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere."
S04E01,Two Swords,715,"Gold, silver, more daughters."
S04E01,Two Swords,716,Always something if you know how to make them talk.
S04E01,Two Swords,717,And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing.
S04E01,Two Swords,718,You could do well for yourself.
S04E01,Two Swords,719,We certainly have been.
S04E01,Two Swords,720,- I'm not going to King's Landing. - Think about it.
S04E01,Two Swords,721,"We could do whatever we like, wherever we go."
S04E01,Two Swords,722,These are the King's colours.
S04E01,Two Swords,723,No one's standing in his way now.
S04E01,Two Swords,724,Which means no one's standing in ours.
S04E01,Two Swords,725,Fuck the King.
S04E01,Two Swords,726,"When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater,"
S04E01,Two Swords,727,I didn't believe it.
S04E01,Two Swords,728,- But here you are. - Here I am.
S04E01,Two Swords,729,Bring me one of those chickens.
S04E01,Two Swords,730,- You got money to pay for it? - You paid for it?
S04E01,Two Swords,731,No.
S04E01,Two Swords,732,But we're the King's men.
S04E01,Two Swords,733,"So, you got money?"
S04E01,Two Swords,734,Not a penny.
S04E01,Two Swords,735,I'll still take that chicken.
S04E01,Two Swords,736,Tell you what.
S04E01,Two Swords,737,We'll trade you.
S04E01,Two Swords,738,One of our little chickens for one of yours.
S04E01,Two Swords,739,Give us a go at your friend.
S04E01,Two Swords,740,Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
S04E01,Two Swords,741,You're a talker.
S04E01,Two Swords,742,Listening makes me thirsty.
S04E01,Two Swords,743,And hungry.
S04E01,Two Swords,744,Think I'll take two chickens.
S04E01,Two Swords,745,You don't understand the situation.
S04E01,Two Swords,746,"I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth,"
S04E01,Two Swords,747,I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.
S04E01,Two Swords,748,You lived your life for the King.
S04E01,Two Swords,749,You're gonna die for some chickens?
S04E01,Two Swords,750,Someone is.
S04E01,Two Swords,751,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
S04E01,Two Swords,752,What do you mean?
S04E01,Two Swords,753,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
S04E01,Two Swords,754,Carry me?
S04E01,Two Swords,755,Fine little blade.
S04E01,Two Swords,756,Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,1,Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,2,Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,3,Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,4,Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,5,There you are.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,6,I can't see her. Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,7,Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,8,"lf you make it out of the woods, you win!"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,9,"Run, Tansy!"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,10,- Tansy! - Where is she?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,11,Tansy!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,12,Good girls. Down.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,13,"Well done. You, too."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,14,- I only wounded her. - You brought her down. That's what matters.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,15,"A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,16,"- A fine shot, master. My lady. - Please, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,17,- It hurts. Please. - Sweet. Don't cry.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,18,It will be over soon.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,19,She thinks she's pretty.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,20,Let me put one through her face.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,21,"We have to reward the hounds, love."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,22,- They did all the hard work. - Why? I did whatever you asked.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,23,But you made Myranda feel jealous.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,24,"- Me, jealous of her? - My lord, please."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,25,You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,26,Rip her!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,27,Rip her!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,28,Not so pretty now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,29,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,30,"Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,31,- Is it solid gold? - Gilded steel.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,32,You're not eating. Why is no one eating?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,33,My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,34,"- I'm not hungry. - You lost a hand, not a stomach."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,35,Try the boar.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,36,Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,37,A toast.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,38,To the proud Lannister children.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,39,"The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,40,"- I'll clean it up. - No, I'll do it. Leave us."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,41,It's only wine.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,42,I can't fight any more.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,43,What about your left?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,44,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,45,How can I protect the King when I can hardly wipe my own ass?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,46,You're the Lord Commander now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,47,Command. Let others do the fighting.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,48,When was the last time Father used a sword?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,49,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,50,When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,51,"Train, then."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,52,- Learn to fight with your other hand. - With whom? You?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,53,Men talk.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,54,"As soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,55,"You need a proper, discreet swordsman."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,56,I have just the one.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,57,My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,58,Unusual talent for a sellsword.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,59,"He tells me you shit gold, just like your father."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,60,Is this place safe?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,61,"There's this knight, Leygood. Got thunderbolts on his shield."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,62,Uh-huh.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,63,Right here is where I fuck his wife.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,64,"She's a screamer, that one."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,65,"If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,66,I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,67,"Problem is,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,68,"if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,69,"And if I fight with an edged blade,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,70,I'll have no one left to pay me.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,71,I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,72,Mmm-mmm.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,73,"Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,74,Best time to attack a man.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,75,Mind yourself.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,76,- lf I still had my right hand... - Plan on growing it back?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,77,"Come on, then."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,78,Open the gates!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,79,Riders coming in!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,80,Let's get these horses seen to!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,81,Father. Welcome home.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,82,"Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,83,"A pleasure, Mother."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,84,Hello.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,85,"See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,86,And take Lady Walda to her chambers.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,87,"This way, my lady."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,88,Where is your prize?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,89,With the hounds.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,90,I'll have a look at him.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,91,I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,92,Word travels. How he screamed.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,93,You would have loved it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,94,Father.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,95,What did you do to him?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,96,I trained him.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,97,"He was a slow learner, but he learned."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,98,- You flayed him. - Peeled a few bits.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,99,Removed a few others.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,100,This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,101,"We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,102,The flayed man is on our banners.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,103,"My banners, not yours."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,104,You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,105,Tywin Lannister has given me the North.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,106,But he won't lift a finger to help me take it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,107,"As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,108,our armies are trapped south of the Neck.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,109,"Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,110,I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,111,I already asked.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,112,Lord Greyjoy refused.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,113,Savages have no...
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,114,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,115,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,116,I acted.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,117,"I had to smuggle myself into my own lands, thanks to the Greyjoys."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,118,I needed Theon whole.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,119,Theon was our enemy.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,120,But Reek
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,121,will never betray us.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,122,I placed far too much trust in you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,123,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,124,"- It's disrespectful. - Sorry, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,125,Give him the razor.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,126,"I'm not a Bolton, Father. What does it matter?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,127,"Go on, Reek."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,128,A nice close shave.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,129,"Reek,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,130,"tell Father,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,131,where are Bran and Rickon Stark?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,132,"I don't know, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,133,You murdered them
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,134,and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,135,"Reek,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,136,did you murder the Stark boys?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,137,"No, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,138,Just two farm boys.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,139,And crisped them so no one would know?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,140,"Yes, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,141,The Starks have always ruled the North.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,142,"If Bran and Rickon are alive,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,143,"the country will rally to their side,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,144,now that Robb Stark is gone.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,145,"Oh, that's right, Reek."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,146,Robb Stark is dead.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,147,Sorry.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,148,I know he was like a brother to you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,149,But my father put a knife through his heart.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,150,How do you feel about that?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,151,- You ready for a hunt? - Always.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,152,"Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,153,Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,154,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,155,Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,156,Their bastard brother.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,157,He could be sheltering them.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,158,He may know where they are.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,159,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,160,Could be a threat.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,161,You want to prove yourself a Bolton?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,162,Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,163,Bring this creature of yours.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,164,Maybe he'll be of some use.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,165,"Take the Moat for the family, for our family,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,166,and I'll reconsider your position.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,167,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the King?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,168,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,169,"Oh, to be foreign."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,170,Shae has been noticed.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,171,Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,172,It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,173,So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,174,"My father will ask you if there's anything more, and you'll tell him some clever lie."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,175,"No, I will not."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,176,How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,177,if they suspected me of lying?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,178,I have no pet sellsword to protect me.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,179,No legendary brother to avenge me.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,180,Only little birds who whisper in my ear.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,181,Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,182,"No one weeps for spiders, or whores."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,183,I have friends across the sea who could help her.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,184,She won't leave.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,185,"I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,186,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,187,Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,188,"From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,189,"Your Grace, it is my honour to present you with this wedding cup."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,190,May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,191,"A handsome goblet, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,192,Or shall I call you Father?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,193,"I should be honoured, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,194,She's the whore I told you about.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,195,The dark-haired one.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,196,Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,197,Hmm.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,198,A book?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,199,The Lives of Four Kings.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,200,"Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,201,"Baelor the Blessed,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,202,"Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,203,A book every king should read.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,204,"Now that the war is won,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,205,we should all find time for wisdom.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,206,"Thank you, Uncle."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,207,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,208,freshly forged in your honour.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,209,"Careful, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,210,Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,211,So they say.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,212,Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,213,Stormbringer.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,214,- Terminus. - Widow's Wail.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,215,- Wolfsbane. - Widow's Wail. I like that.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,216,"Every time I use it,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,217,it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,218,Don't.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,219,You want me on the desk?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,220,"- What's wrong, my lion? - Don't call me that."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,221,What should I call you?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,222,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,223,Our friendship?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,224,There's a ship waiting in the harbour bound for Pentos.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,225,What?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,226,"You'll have your own cabin,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,227,"and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,228,- What is this? - I'm a married man.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,229,"My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,230,I don't want her to suffer any more on my account.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,231,I need to uphold my vows.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,232,She doesn't want you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,233,- I need to do right by her. - You don't want her.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,234,By our children.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,235,What are you afraid of?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,236,- I'm not afraid. - You are.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,237,You are afraid of your father and your sister.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,238,- You're going to run from them all your life? - I need you to leave.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,239,I'm not afraid of them.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,240,- I'm not going to run from them. - Shae.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,241,"We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,242,You're a whore!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,243,"Sansa is fit to bear my children, and you are not."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,244,I can't be in love with a whore.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,245,I can't have children with a whore.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,246,"How many men have you been with? 500? 5,000?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,247,How many whores have you been with?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,248,"I have enjoyed my time with all of them,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,249,and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,250,But now that time is over.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,251,You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,252,Bronn will escort you to your ship.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,253,Hear us now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,254,"Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,255,and lead us from the darkness.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,256,"Sire, I served you well."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,257,"Lord of Light, show us the way."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,258,"- Lead us from the darkness. - Selyse, you're my sister!"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,259,- Yours are the stars that guide us. - Tell him!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,260,"- Tell him! - Lord of Light, protect us,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,261,for the night is dark and full of terrors.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,262,Did you see? Their souls.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,263,It was their souls.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,264,Our lord took them. Did you see?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,265,Lord Florent was your brother by law.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,266,He was an infidel.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,267,He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,268,"They were the gods of your fathers, too."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,269,I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,270,How many ships did he bring to your cause? How many men?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,271,A good deal more than you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,272,"Did you see, Ser Davos?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,273,They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,274,"I'm sure they're more than grateful, My Queen."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,275,Meat's off.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,276,Our larders are almost empty.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,277,"Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,278,You hate fish.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,279,"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,280,"When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,281,Stannis boiled soup for me from books.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,282,The binding glue is made from horses.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,283,"One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,284,I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,285,- Do you remember? - Of course.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,286,"Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,287,That's all I knew when I was a child.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,288,Until you found the Lord of Light?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,289,Until he found me.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,290,I fear for our daughter's soul.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,291,Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,292,- She's a stubborn little beast. - She's a child.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,293,You barely know her.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,294,You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,295,She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,296,Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,297,She needs the rod.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,298,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,299,As you command.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,300,Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,301,Come in.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,302,"Were you sleeping, Princess?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,303,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,304,I heard it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,305,And it frightened you?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,306,Ser Axell was my uncle.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,307,He was always kind to me.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,308,"They're in a better place now, Princess."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,309,The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,310,But they screamed.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,311,Women scream when they give birth.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,312,Afterward they are filled with joy.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,313,Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,314,"You have so many questions, don't you?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,315,So did I when I was a child.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,316,I was much like you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,317,Only I wasn't a princess.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,318,And you didn't have this.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,319,No.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,320,"But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,321,What do you know of the gods?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,322,I read The Seven-Pointed Star.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,323,Lies and fables.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,324,Septons speak of seven gods.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,325,There are but two.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,326,"A god of light and love and joy,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,327,"and a god of darkness, evil, and fear."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,328,Eternally at war.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,329,Then there are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,330,"There's only one hell, Princess."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,331,The one we live in now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,332,Hodor.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,333,Why did you wake me?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,334,You've been gone for hours.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,335,I was hungry.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,336,We're all hungry.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,337,I was just eating.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,338,Summer was eating.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,339,Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,340,Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,341,"You're not a direwolf, Bran."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,342,"Must be glorious, though."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,343,"To run, to leap, to hunt."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,344,To be whole.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,345,"I know it's tempting,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,346,"but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,347,"You'd forget us, Bran."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,348,"You'd forget your mother and father, your brothers and sisters, Winterfell."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,349,You'd forget you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,350,"And if we lose you, we lose everything."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,351,"Hodor, take me to the tree."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,352,Look for me
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,353,beneath the tree.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,354,CERSEl: He saw us!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,355,North.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,356,I know where we have to go.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,357,Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,358,and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,359,"are one heart, one flesh, one soul."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,360,Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,361,"With this kiss, I pledge my love."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,362,We have a new queen.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,363,Better her than you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,364,"- Bit much, wouldn't you say? - It feels proportionate."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,365,- Proportionate to what? - The expected extravagance.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,366,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,367,tend not to have it for long.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,368,You ought to try enjoying something before you die.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,369,You might find it suits you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,370,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,371,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,372,I'm paying my share.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,373,Shall we stick golden roses on half the meat pies
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,374,to commemorate your generosity?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,375,"No, your heartfelt ""Thank you"" is its own reward."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,376,I would imagine I'll be hearing it again before long.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,377,Wars are rather expensive.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,378,"""The Iron Bank will have its due."""
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,379,How they love to remind everyone.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,380,Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,381,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,382,We both know you're smarter than that.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,383,"Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,384,All taken care of.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,385,"- You saw her board the ship? - Aye, she's on it."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,386,And you saw the ship sail away?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,387,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,388,How do you know?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,389,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,390,I'm the last person they ever follow.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,391,Was someone following you?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,392,She's gone.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,393,"I know you don't want to believe it, but she is."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,394,"Now, go drink until it feels like you did the right thing."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,395,Hello.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,396,- Hello. - Not you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,397,"You look exquisite, child."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,398,"The wind has been at you, though."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,399,I haven't had the opportunity to tell you
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,400,how sorry I was to hear about your brother.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,401,"War is war, but killing a man at a wedding,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,402,horrid.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,403,What sort of monster would do such a thing?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,404,As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,405,My lady.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,406,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,407,Perhaps if your pauper husband
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,408,"were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,409,he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,410,"Now that peace has come and all is right with the world,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,411,it would do you good to see some of it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,412,You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,413,A coat of gold
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,414,A coat of red
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,415,A lion still has claws
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,416,And mine are long...
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,417,Very good. Off you go.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,418,"My love, why don't we make the announcement?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,419,Everyone.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,420,The Queen would like to say a few words.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,421,We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvellous food and drink.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,422,Not all among us are so lucky.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,423,"To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,424,King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,425,be given to the poorest in his city.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,426,You're an example to us all.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,427,"Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,428,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,429,Your sister looks very beautiful.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,430,As does yours.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,431,"So, are you looking forward to your wedding?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,432,"Yes, very much."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,433,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,434,- They certainly are. - Perhaps they should get married.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,435,"If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,436,"If you somehow managed to put a child in her first,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,437,"she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,438,"Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,439,And neither will you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,440,Your Grace. My King.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,441,- My Queen. - Lady Brienne.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,442,So good of you to come.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,443,"I'm no lady, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,444,CERSEl: Did you just bow?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,445,"Apologies, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,446,I never did master the curtsy.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,447,You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,448,"That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,449,A shame.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,450,I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,451,I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,452,The country has been at war too long.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,453,I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,454,- Yes. - Thank you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,455,I hope we see more of you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,456,Lady Brienne.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,457,You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,458,That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,459,"As you say, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,460,I owe you my gratitude.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,461,You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,462,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,463,More than once.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,464,Did he?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,465,Haven't heard that story before.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,466,Not such a fascinating story.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,467,I'm sure you have many.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,468,"Sworn to Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark, and now my brother."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,469,"Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,470,serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,471,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,472,But you love him.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,473,Your Grace.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,474,"No, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,475,"- She'll do no such thing. - Oh, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,476,This young lady sought my advice...
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,477,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,478,- Your Grace. - Qyburn? Deplorable man.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,479,Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,480,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,481,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,482,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,483,What do you think I could do to you?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,484,I never meant to annoy anyone.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,485,But you are. You're annoying me right now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,486,Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,487,So here's what I want you to do. Leave my presence.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,488,Leave this wedding right now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,489,Go to the kitchens and instruct them that
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,490,all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,491,"Your Grace, Queen Margaery..."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,492,"The Queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,493,or you will.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,494,A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,495,You're in rather a good mood.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,496,- I suppose I am. - I won't ask why.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,497,- Small pleasures. - Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,498,Prince Oberyn.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,499,I don't believe you have met Ellaria.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,500,"This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,501,"and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,502,I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,503,"Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,504,- Ellaria Sand. - My lord. My lady.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,505,Charmed.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,506,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,507,"We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,508,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,509,- We don't despise them in Dorne. - No? How tolerant of you.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,510,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,511,Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,512,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,513,It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,514,Please give him our regards.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,515,"With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,516,They call it the rich man's disease.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,517,A wonder you don't have it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,518,Noblemen in my part of the country
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,519,don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,520,People everywhere have their differences.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,521,"In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,522,"In other places, the rape and murder of women and children"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,523,is considered distasteful.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,524,"What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,525,that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,526,"Everyone, silence! Clear the floor."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,527,There's been too much amusement here today.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,528,A royal wedding is not an amusement.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,529,A royal wedding is history.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,530,Time has come for all of us to contemplate our history.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,531,"My lords,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,532,"my ladies,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,533,I give you
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,534,"King Joffrey,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,535,"Renly, Stannis,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,536,"Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy!"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,537,The War of the Five Kings!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,538,I'm the rightful king.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,539,- King in the North! - Yes!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,540,Traitor.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,541,You're a traitor.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,542,I'm the King of the Seven Kingdoms!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,543,Let the war begin.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,544,"Renly, you're no king."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,545,"Away, degenerate."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,546,Careful.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,547,- Go on. - I want you to be my prince.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,548,Stannis!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,549,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,550,I am the rightful king.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,551,"Challenge me, kraken."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,552,- Take that. - I'm drowning!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,553,I am the King in the North!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,554,Not wildfire!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,555,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,556,"Yes, my lord."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,557,We'll have to find another way to thank the King.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,558,Charge!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,559,Ready? Again.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,560,I am the King in the North!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,561,- Charge! - Charge!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,562,Yes!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,563,Your head!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,564,Fine gentlemen.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,565,Well fought.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,566,Here you are. Champion's purse.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,567,"Though you're not the champion yet, are you?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,568,A true champion defeats all the challengers.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,569,Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,570,Uncle.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,571,How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,572,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,573,I would like to keep what remains of my face.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,574,I think you should fight him.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,575,This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,576,I speak as a firsthand witness.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,577,Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,578,and show everyone how a true king wins his throne.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,579,"Be careful, though."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,580,This one is clearly mad with lust.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,581,It would be a tragedy for the King to lose his virtue
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,582,hours before his wedding night.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,583,A fine vintage.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,584,Shame that it spilled.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,585,It did not spill.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,586,"My love, come back to me."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,587,It's time for my father's toast.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,588,How does he expect me to toast without wine?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,589,"Uncle, you can be my cupbearer"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,590,seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,591,Your Grace does me a great honour.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,592,It's not meant as an honour.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,593,Bring me my goblet.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,594,What good is an empty cup?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,595,Fill it.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,596,Kneel.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,597,Kneel before your king.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,598,Kneel.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,599,I said kneel!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,600,"Look, the pie."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,601,My Queen.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,602,Wonderful.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,603,My hero.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,604,- Can we leave now? - Let's find out.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,605,Uncle.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,606,Where are you going?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,607,"You're my cupbearer, remember?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,608,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,609,"No, you're perfect the way you are."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,610,Serve me my wine.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,611,Hurry up. This pie is dry.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,612,"Mmm, good."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,613,Needs washing down.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,614,"If it please Your Grace,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,615,- Lady Sansa is very tired. - No.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,616,"No, you'll wait here..."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,617,Your Grace?
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,618,It's nothing.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,619,- He's choking! - Help the poor boy.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,620,"- Idiots, help your king. - Move away!"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,621,- Joffrey! - CERSEl: Help him!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,622,- Someone help him! - Joffrey!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,623,- Come with me now. - CERSEl: Joffrey!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,624,"If you want to live, we have to leave."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,625,Don't touch him!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,626,Joffrey.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,627,"Please, Joffrey."
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,628,"Joffrey, what is it?"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,629,Help him!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,630,My son.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,631,He did this.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,632,"He poisoned my son,"
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,633,your king.
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,634,Take him!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,635,Take him!
S04E02,The Lion And The Rose,636,Take him!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,1,You did this!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,2,- We have to leave. - CERSEl: Take him!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,3,Where is his wife?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,4,Where's Sansa?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,5,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbour.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,6,- Where is she? - No one leaves the capital!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,7,Get in.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,8,- Where are we going? - Somewhere safe.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,9,"Up you go, my lady."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,10,You'll be fine.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,11,You're stronger than you know.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,12,- Lord Baelish? - Petyr.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,13,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,14,Good.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,15,I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,16,- The worst is past. - Lord Baelish.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,17,"- I promised I'd get her to you safely. - Softly, my friend."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,18,Voices carry over water.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,19,I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,20,First you'll want your pay.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,21,"- Ten thousand, was it? - Ten thousand."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,22,Wait!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,23,Shh.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,24,"You don't want the Queen to hear, do you?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,25,A thousand gold cloaks are searching for you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,26,"And if they found you,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,27,how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the King?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,28,I didn't murder anyone.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,29,"I know. But you must admit, it looks suspicious."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,30,"The King who executed your father,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,31,"who tormented you for years,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,32,and you fled the scene of his murder.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,33,Why did you kill him?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,34,"Because he was a drunk and a fool,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,35,and I don't trust drunk fools.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,36,He saved me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,37,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,38,And he did it all for gold.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,39,Money buys a man's silence for a time.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,40,A bolt in the heart buys it forever.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,41,He was helping me because I saved his life.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,42,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,43,that once belonged to his grandmother.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,44,The last legacy of House Hollard.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,45,I had it made a few weeks ago.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,46,What did I once tell you about the capital?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,47,"""We're all liars here."""
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,48,"Come, my lady."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,49,I know you've had a difficult day.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,50,But you're safe now.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,51,I promise you that.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,52,"You're safe with me,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,53,sailing home.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,54,So am I the queen?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,55,More than you were with Renly.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,56,Less than you would have been
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,57,if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,58,This would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,59,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stop..."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,60,It was horrible.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,61,The world is overflowing with horrible things.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,62,But they're all a tray of cakes next to death.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,63,They brought me your grandfather's body when he died.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,64,Made me look at it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,65,What was it like?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,66,They took me to the Great Hall. There he was.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,67,The man I'd married and suffered to father my children.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,68,A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,69,"There he was,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,70,lying on a table.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,71,One of my husbands preferred the company of men
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,72,and was stabbed through the heart.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,73,Another was happiest torturing animals
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,74,and was poisoned at our wedding feast.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,75,- I must be cursed. - Nonsense.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,76,Your circumstances have improved markedly.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,77,"You may not have enjoyed watching him die,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,78,but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,79,"being married to him, I can promise you that."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,80,But I would have been the queen.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,81,Our alliance with the Lannisters
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,82,remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,83,You did wonderful work on Joffrey.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,84,The next one should be easier.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,85,Your brother is dead.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,86,Do you know what that means?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,87,I'm not trying to trick you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,88,It means I'll become king.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,89,"Yes, you will become king."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,90,What kind of king do you think you'll be?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,91,- A good king? - Mmm.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,92,I think so as well.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,93,You've got the right temperament for it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,94,But what makes a good king? Hmm?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,95,What is a good king's single most important quality?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,96,This is hardly the place or the time.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,97,- Holiness? - Hmm.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,98,Baelor the Blessed was holy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,99,And pious.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,100,He built this Sept.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,101,He also named a 6-year-old boy High Septon
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,102,because he thought the boy could work miracles.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,103,He ended up fasting himself into an early grave
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,104,because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,105,Hmm.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,106,- Justice. - Mmm.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,107,A good king must be just.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,108,Orys I was just.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,109,"Everyone applauded his reforms,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,110,nobles and commoners alike.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,111,But he wasn't just for long.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,112,He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,113,Was that truly just of him?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,114,To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognise?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,115,- No. - No.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,116,- What about strength? - Yes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,117,Strength.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,118,King Robert was strong.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,119,He won the rebellion
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,120,and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,121,And he attended three Small Council meetings in 17 years.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,122,He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,123,until the last two killed him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,124,"So, we have a man who starves himself to death,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,125,"a man who lets his own brother murder him,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,126,and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,127,What do they all lack?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,128,- Wisdom. - Yes!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,129,- Wisdom is what makes a good king. - Yes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,130,But what is wisdom? Hmm?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,131,A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,132,against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,133,How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,134,You've any experience of treasuries and granaries
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,135,or shipyards and soldiers?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,136,- No. - Of course not.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,137,A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,138,You're young.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,139,A wise young king listens to his counsellors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,140,And the wisest kings
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,141,continue to listen to them long afterwards.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,142,Your brother was not a wise king.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,143,Your brother was not a good king.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,144,"If he had been,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,145,perhaps he'd still be alive.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,146,"Now, as the king, you will have to marry."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,147,Do you understand why?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,148,A king needs a queen.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,149,"Yes, but why?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,150,To further the family line.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,151,- Do you know how that happens? - Yes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,152,But has anyone explained the details to you?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,153,I don't think so.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,154,It's all relatively straightforward.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,155,- How are you? - I'm all right.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,156,You are. You will be.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,157,I'll see to that.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,158,Please give the Queen a moment alone with her son.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,159,"- Yes, my lord. - All of you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,160,It was Tyrion.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,161,He killed him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,162,He told me he would.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,163,"""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,164,"""and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."""
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,165,That's what he said to me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,166,You saw it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,167,- You saw Joff point at him just before he... - I don't know what I saw.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,168,Avenge him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,169,Avenge our son.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,170,Kill Tyrion.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,171,Tyrion's my brother.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,172,Our brother.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,173,There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,174,I don't want a trial.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,175,He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,176,I want him dead.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,177,"Please, Jaime. You have to."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,178,He was our son.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,179,Our baby boy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,180,You're a hateful woman.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,181,Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,182,"Jaime, not here, please."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,183,Please.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,184,Stop it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,185,- Stop it. - No.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,186,Stop it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,187,Stop.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,188,Stop. It's not right.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,189,It's not right.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,190,I don't care.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,191,- Don't. - I don't care.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,192,"- Jaime, don't. - I don't care."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,193,Gonna rain soon.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,194,Where are we?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,195,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,196,You think?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,197,You don't have a map?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,198,- No. - Maybe we should get one.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,199,"Just point out the next map shop you see, and I'll buy you one."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,200,- How far is it to the Eyrie? - Far.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,201,And you're sure we're going the right way?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,202,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,203,"Get my gold, be on my way."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,204,- Where? - Why do you care?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,205,Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,206,Fight as a sellsword.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,207,"Second Sons, could be."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,208,Seems like a good fit for me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,209,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,210,Why Braavos?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,211,I have friends there.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,212,I doubt it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,213,Seven blessings to you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,214,- What do you want? - This is my land.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,215,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,216,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,217,Forgive my father.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,218,He was wounded fighting in the war.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,219,"Our cottage burned down while he was gone, and my mother with it."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,220,He's never been the same.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,221,Which house did he fight for?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,222,The Tullys of Riverrun.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,223,There's a storm coming.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,224,You'll be wanting a roof tonight.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,225,There's fresh hay in the barn.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,226,And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,227,"We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,228,"We ask the Father to judge us with mercy, accepting our human frailty."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,229,"We ask the Mother to bless our crops,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,230,so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,231,We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,232,We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,233,and keep her from the clutches of depravity.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,234,You going to do all seven of the fuckers?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,235,Father!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,236,"We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,237,so we may finish the work required of us.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,238,We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,239,And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,240,I'm so sorry.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,241,Really good.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,242,Did you fight at the Twins?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,243,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,244,"The Red Wedding, they're calling it."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,245,Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,246,He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,247,Guest right don't mean much any more.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,248,It means something to me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,249,The gods will have their vengeance.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,250,Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,251,Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,252,"We had good years and bad years, same as anyone, but we were safe."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,253,"Now with the Freys,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,254,"raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,255,"I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,256,but the North's no better. The whole country's gone sour.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,257,You got any ale?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,258,Afraid not.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,259,How can a man not keep ale in his home?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,260,You look like you could really swing that sword.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,261,A real warrior with proper training.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,262,Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,263,How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,264,I could use a man to help with the farm work.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,265,"Sally does what she can,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,266,but she can't lift a bale of hay.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,267,"And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,268,"one look at you, I bet they'd run the other way."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,269,Meaning no offence.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,270,What'll you pay?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,271,I don't have much.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,272,But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,273,Fair wages for fair work?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,274,Fair wages for fair work.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,275,Ahhh!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,276,- What did you do? - Get your horse saddled.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,277,- You told me you weren't a thief. - I wasn't.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,278,He took us in. He fed us and you...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,279,"Aye, he took us in. He's a good man, and his daughter makes a nice stew."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,280,And they'll both be dead come winter.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,281,- You don't know that. - I do.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,282,He's weak. He can't protect himself.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,283,They'll both be dead come winter.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,284,Dead men don't need silver.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,285,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,286,There's plenty worse than me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,287,I just understand the way things are.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,288,How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,289,Raper.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,290,Horse thief.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,291,Ninth-born son.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,292,Raper. Thief.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,293,Thief and raper.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,294,"There he is, Sam the Slayer."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,295,Going to visit your wildling whore?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,296,- She's not a whore. - No?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,297,Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,298,They all think I'm lying.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,299,About what?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,300,Killing the White Walker.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,301,You're not lying.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,302,I'll never forget the way it screamed.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,303,But you're the only one that saw it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,304,And they all think you're just a...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,305,A what?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,306,A wildling.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,307,My father hated that word.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,308,- It's not a very nice word. - I don't know.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,309,"It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,310,"So, are you all right?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,311,No one bothering you?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,312,I get a lot of looks.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,313,I hear them making their jokes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,314,"But no one's touched me, if that's what you mean."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,315,I worry about it sometimes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,316,All the time.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,317,Why do you worry about it?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,318,"One hundred men, one woman."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,319,They've got other things to think about.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,320,That's the only thing they think about.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,321,- You're being silly. - I'm not being silly.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,322,"There's 100 men lying awake at night, picturing you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,323,What about you?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,324,What about me?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,325,Gilly?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,326,I worry about you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,327,Thank you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,328,For what?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,329,For worrying about me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,330,I don't know if you're safe here.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,331,"They're my brothers,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,332,but some of them were thieves before they came here.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,333,Some of them were rapers.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,334,You saw what they did at your father's keep.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,335,So what are you saying?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,336,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,337,Are you bored of me?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,338,Bored of you?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,339,I...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,340,I want to protect you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,341,I'll get these to Hobb.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,342,Keep an eye on little Sam.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,343,Your Grace.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,344,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,345,"- Joffrey? - ""The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon."""
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,346,"I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,347,filled with bastard blood.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,348,A bastard you set free.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,349,"I am now faced with a great opportunity,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,350,and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,351,"I will find you an army, Your Grace."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,352,- I've been working day and night... - What progress have you made?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,353,- I've rallied House Peasebury to your cause. - House Peasebury.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,354,- House Musgood. - House Musgood.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,355,- And House Haigh. - House Haigh.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,356,They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,357,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,358,We need to look east for ships and men.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,359,"10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,360,- The Golden Company? - They've never broken a contract.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,361,They're sellswords.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,362,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,363,but we're not willing to pay men to fight?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,364,Now the Red Woman's magic is real.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,365,"Her visions and prophecies may be, too,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,366,but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,367,Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,368,It's dirty on the ground.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,369,We don't have any gold.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,370,Not yet.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,371,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,372,I will not become a page in someone else's history book.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,373,"I'm running out of time, Ser Davos."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,374,Which means you're running out of time.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,375,You're late.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,376,"I'm sorry, Princess."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,377,I thought you weren't coming.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,378,The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,379,"You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,380,"That happened once, weeks ago."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,381,"You're your father's daughter, no mistake."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,382,"Bloody relentless, the both of you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,383,It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,384,But I think you can manage.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,385,You'll never read well if you move your lips.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,386,That's how children do it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,387,"""The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,388,"""First Sword of Braavos."""
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,389,Thank you very much.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,390,I like this one. It's full of swordfights and pirates.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,391,"- You were a pirate once. - No, I was a smuggler."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,392,What's the difference?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,393,"If you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,394,My father says a criminal is a criminal.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,395,Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behaviour.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,396,So do the Braavosi.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,397,- You've sailed to Braavos? - Of course.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,398,Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,399,"I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,400,but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,401,I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,402,"and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,403,you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,404,- What was that for? - I need you to write a message.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,405,You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,406,It's too important for me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,407,I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,408,"To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,409,"from Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of Westeros."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,410,But that's not you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,411,I need to get their attention.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,412,Go. Write.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,413,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,414,- Precious little thing. - Thank you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,415,- What's his name? - Sam.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,416,Lovely.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,417,- That the daddy? - No.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,418,Where's the daddy?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,419,He's dead.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,420,Where you from?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,421,North of here.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,422,North of here?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,423,You a fucking wildling?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,424,- Only room and board? - That's right.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,425,She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,426,"Could find other work for her, too."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,427,- No other work. - There'd be money.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,428,Give you a piece of it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,429,No other work.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,430,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,431,You'll be safer here.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,432,Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,433,You protected me north of the Wall.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,434,This is different.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,435,"They're brothers of the Night's Watch, and I can't just stab them in the back."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,436,"And I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,437,You have to trust me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,438,It's for the best.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,439,Best for you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,440,"Oh, Gilly."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,441,Please don't...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,442,Greedy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,443,No?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,444,"I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,445,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,446,"That's quite all right, lover. There's more for you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,447,Your loss.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,448,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,449,- Does that surprise you? - Everyone has a preference.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,450,Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,451,"The gods made that, and it delights me."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,452,"The gods made this,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,453,and it delights me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,454,"When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,455,"When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,456,I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,457,"What are you, 25?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,458,Children.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,459,"Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realise you are old."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,460,"That pretty ass of yours will sag,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,461,"your belly will grow soft, and your back will ache in the night,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,462,and grey hairs will sprout from your ears.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,463,No one will want you any more.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,464,Make sure you've fucked your fill before that day.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,465,Did you?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,466,He is a prince of Dorne.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,467,Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,468,They will all have to line up behind you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,469,- Prince Oberyn. - Lord Tywin.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,470,May we have the room?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,471,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,472,Would you like to sit?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,473,"No, thank you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,474,"- Some wine? - No, thank you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,475,I'm sorry about your grandson.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,476,Are you?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,477,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,478,Or his grandfather.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,479,An awful way to die.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,480,Which way is that?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,481,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,482,Some believe the King choked.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,483,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,484,The King was poisoned.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,485,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,486,I did. This is why I know.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,487,Your hatred for my family is rather well-known.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,488,"You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,489,some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,490,Rather suspicious.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,491,Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,492,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,493,- What did you discuss? - You think we conspired together?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,494,What did you discuss?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,495,The death of my sister.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,496,For which you blame me.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,497,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,498,The Mountain follows your orders.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,499,Of course I blame you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,500,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,501,Should I be concerned?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,502,You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,503,I am a man of reason.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,504,"If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,505,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,506,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,507,Categorically.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,508,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,509,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,510,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,511,I could arrange for this meeting.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,512,But you want something in return.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,513,"There will be a trial for my son and, as custom dictates,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,514,three judges will render a verdict.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,515,I will preside.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,516,Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,517,I would like you to be the third.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,518,Why?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,519,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,520,Declared themselves enemies of the throne.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,521,Now they are our strongest allies.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,522,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,523,Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,524,I would also invite you to sit on the Small Council
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,525,to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,526,"I never realised you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,527,We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,528,The King is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,529,A wildling army marches on the Wall.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,530,"And in the east, a Targaryen girl has three dragons."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,531,"Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,532,Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,533,You're saying you need us?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,534,That must be hard for you to admit.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,535,We need each other.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,536,"You help me serve justice to the King's assassins,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,537,and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,538,Podrick.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,539,Apologies for the stench.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,540,"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,541,A noble effort.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,542,"They didn't find the candles, though."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,543,"A quill, some parchment,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,544,"duck sausage, almonds,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,545,and some hard cheese.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,546,You're a good lad.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,547,Any word of Shae?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,548,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,549,I suppose that's a good thing.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,550,What are they saying about me out there?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,551,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the King.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,552,"- Do you believe I murdered Joffrey? - No, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,553,You didn't?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,554,"Gods, no."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,555,"The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,556,"I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,557,"I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,558,gawking like a fool when the King died.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,559,Trial in a fortnight.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,560,Have they announced the judges yet?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,561,- Your father. - Of course.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,562,Mace Tyrell.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,563,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,564,- And Prince Oberyn of Dorne. - Oberyn?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,565,Give it to my father.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,566,He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,567,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,568,Anyone who might testify on your behalf.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,569,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,570,How generous of them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,571,"Very well, my wife. Sansa."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,572,"My lord, she's gone."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,573,- Gone? - No one's seen her since the wedding.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,574,You don't think she...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,575,"No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,576,but the girl is no assassin.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,577,Whoever killed the King wanted me to lose my head for it.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,578,"And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,579,"- Podrick. - Yes, my lord?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,580,- They'll be following you now. - Who will?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,581,I don't know. They. The ominous they.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,582,The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,583,Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,584,Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,585,"Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,586,"But say what you will of Cersei,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,587,she loves her children.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,588,She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,589,Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,590,"Any other witnesses, my lord?"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,591,"Varys could vouch for me, if he dared."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,592,He's already been called as a witness for the Queen.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,593,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,594,"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,595,Why not?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,596,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,597,He's under investigation himself.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,598,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,599,"I'll ask, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,600,"There's something else, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,601,"A man, I didn't know his face,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,602,he came to ask if I'd testify against you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,603,Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,604,if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the strangler.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,605,Ser Podrick Payne?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,606,"- Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him? - I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,607,Are you going to accept their offer?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,608,- My lord. - Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,609,"If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,610,"- You've been good to me, my lord. - Pod, the trial's in a fortnight."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,611,They'll want an answer before that.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,612,"I already gave them an answer, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,613,I will not have you dying on my behalf.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,614,Do you hear me?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,615,"If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,616,I don't want to see your head already mounted.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,617,"- My lord. - Pod, I am giving you an order."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,618,Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,619,And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,620,Pod!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,621,This is farewell.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,622,"Farewell, my lord."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,623,Pod.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,624,There has never lived a more loyal squire.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,625,Mother says it's time to eat.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,626,What's she got boiling? Wait. Let me guess.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,627,Potatoes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,628,No one boils a potato better than your mom.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,629,She got...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,630,The wildlings!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,631,Guymon!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,632,Hide.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,633,- Hide! - Run!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,634,- You know how to get to Castle Black? - Yes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,635,Those your parents?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,636,Open your eyes.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,637,I'm going to eat them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,638,Do you hear me?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,639,I'm going to eat your dead mama
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,640,and your dead papa.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,641,Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,642,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,643,Aye! Aye!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,644,Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,645,- Seems like that would be a good lesson. - Aye!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,646,"If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,647,"They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,648,We have just over 100 men.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,649,And that's including stewards and builders.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,650,And me. We can't afford to lose a single man.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,651,We must remember our first responsibility.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,652,We are the watchers on the Wall.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,653,There's got to be a way to protect them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,654,"You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,655,What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,656,Mance Rayder is coming.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,657,"If the wildlings breach the Wall,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,658,"they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 miles"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,659,before they reach an army that can stop them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,660,We need to shore up Castle Black
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,661,and defend the Wall.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,662,That is our job.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,663,Rangers returning.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,664,Help him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,665,Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,666,What took you so long?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,667,- We were held up. - By what?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,668,Chains.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,669,We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,670,- And the mutineers stayed? - They're not going anywhere.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,671,They've got Craster's food and his wives.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,672,Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,673,Karl's running things now.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,674,He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,675,We need to ride north and kill them all.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,676,"We just went over this, boy."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,677,- Justice can wait. - It's not about justice.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,678,"I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,679,Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,680,How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,681,when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,682,"Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,683,"As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,684,Then he'll throw his full strength at us.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,685,"And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,686,there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,687,I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,688,Are they attacking?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,689,A single rider.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,690,A champion of Meereen.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,691,They want you to send your own champion against him.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,692,What is he doing?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,693,I believe he means to...
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,694,He says that we're an army of men without man parts.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,695,"He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,696,hides his cock in his own arsehole.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,697,"Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,698,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,699,I have something to say to the people of Meereen.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,700,"First, I will need this one to be quiet."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,701,Do I have a champion?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,702,"Allow me this honour, Mother of Dragons."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,703,I will not disappoint you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,704,You are the commander of the Unsullied.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,705,I cannot risk you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,706,"Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,707,Which is why you must remain by my side.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,708,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,709,Let me stand for you today as well.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,710,"You are my most trusted advisor,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,711,"my most valued general, and my dearest friend."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,712,I will not gamble with your life.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,713,I was the last to join your army.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,714,I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,715,or the commander of your Unsullied.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,716,My mother was a whore. I come from nothing.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,717,I will return to nothing.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,718,Let me kill this man for you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,719,Very well.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,720,You have quite an audience.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,721,Make it worth their while.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,722,"He is very brave, Your Grace."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,723,"Yes, win or lose,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,724,as long as the whole city is watching.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,725,You sure you don't want a horse?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,726,Why would I want a horse?
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,727,Horses are faster than men.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,728,Horses are dumber than men.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,729,I am Daenerys Stormborn.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,730,"Your Masters may have told you lies about me,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,731,or they may have told you nothing.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,732,It does not matter.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,733,I have nothing to say to them.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,734,I speak only to you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,735,"First, I went to Astapor."
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,736,"Those who were slaves in Astapor,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,737,"now stand behind me,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,738,free.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,739,Next I went to Yunkai.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,740,"Those who were slaves in Yunkai,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,741,"now stand behind me,"
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,742,free.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,743,Now I have come to Meereen.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,744,I am not your enemy.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,745,Your enemy is beside you.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,746,Your enemy steals and murders your children.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,747,Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,748,and commands.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,749,I did not bring you commands.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,750,I bring you a choice.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,751,And I bring your enemies what they deserve.
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,752,Forward!
S04E03,Breaker Of Chains,753,Fire!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,1,"""My name"

S04E04,Oathkeeper,6,"""Summer Isles."""
S04E04,Oathkeeper,7,"""Summer Isles."""
S04E04,Oathkeeper,8,I am from an island called Naath.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,9,When they took you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,10,When did they take me?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,11,I was five years old.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,12,You remember your home?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,13,I remember when they rowed us away from shore.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,14,How white the beaches were.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,15,How tall the trees.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,16,And I remember my village burning.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,17,Smoke rising into the sky.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,18,Do you remember your home?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,19,Unsullied.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,20,Always Unsullied.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,21,"Before Unsullied, nothing."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,22,That's not true.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,23,Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,24,I don't want return.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,25,"""Kill the masters."""
S04E04,Oathkeeper,26,Kill the masters.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,27,How are the lessons coming?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,28,"MISSANDEl: Very well, Your Grace."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,29,"Missandei is teacher good, my queen."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,30,You'll have to continue later.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,31,It's time.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,32,You heard her!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,33,She said she came to free us!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,34,You're a fool.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,35,The Masters are too strong.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,36,She will protect us.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,37,She defeated the Masters' champion.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,38,She has a great army.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,39,You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,40,I want to live.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,41,You saw what they did to those children.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,42,What do you think they'll do to us?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,43,"I've been through two slave revolts, boy."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,44,They always end the same way:
S04E04,Oathkeeper,45,the Masters in power and the slaves dead.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,46,All men must die.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,47,"But I promise you,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,48,a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,49,Who are you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,50,This one is called Grey Worm.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,51,"I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,52,raised and trained as Unsullied.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,53,"Now I fight for Daenerys,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,54,the Mother of Dragons
S04E04,Oathkeeper,55,and Breaker of Chains.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,56,You are Unsullied?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,57,They taught you how to fight before you could walk.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,58,We are not soldiers!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,59,"We have no training,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,60,no weapons.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,61,There are three slaves in this city for every Master.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,62,"No one can give you your freedom, brothers."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,63,"If you want it,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,64,you must take it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,65,Mhysa!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,66,Mhysa!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,67,"Remind me, Ser Jorah,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,68,how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,69,"163, Khaleesi."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,70,That was it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,71,"Your Grace, may I have a word?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,72,The city is yours.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,73,"All these people, they're your subjects now."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,74,Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,75,I will answer injustice with justice.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,76,What the hell was that?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,77,That was me knocking your arse to the dirt with your own hand.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,78,You're a rare talent.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,79,"When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,80,You learned to fight like a good little boy.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,81,I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,82,You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,83,You talk to my brother this way?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,84,All the time.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,85,He got used to it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,86,Do you think he did it?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,87,No.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,88,"Oh, he hated the little twat, sure."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,89,But who didn't?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,90,And poison's not his style.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,91,Or murder.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,92,"You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,93,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,94,We're done for today.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,95,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,96,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,97,Aye.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,98,But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,99,You were his first choice.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,100,He named you for his champion
S04E04,Oathkeeper,101,because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,102,You gonna fight for him now?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,103,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,104,Four walls. A pot to piss in.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,105,I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,106,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,107,Maybe a bit.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,108,I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,109,It's complicated.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,110,So how is our sister?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,111,How do you think?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,112,Her son died in her arms.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,113,Her son?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,114,Don't.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,115,- You know what's coming? - Hmm.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,116,My trial for regicide.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,117,"I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,118,that one of my three judges
S04E04,Oathkeeper,119,has wished me dead more times than I can count.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,120,And that judge is my father.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,121,"As for Cersei,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,122,"well, she's probably working on a way"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,123,to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,124,She did ask.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,125,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,126,Depends.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,127,Did you do it?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,128,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,129,I like it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,130,You're really asking if I killed your son?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,131,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,132,How can I help you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,133,You could set me free.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,134,You know I can't.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,135,Then there's really nothing else to say.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,136,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,137,Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,138,I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,139,"Sorry, I'd forgotten."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,140,I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,141,Inappropriate?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,142,You're accused of killing the King. Freeing you is treason.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,143,Except I didn't do it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,144,Which is why we're having a trial.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,145,Oh!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,146,A trial.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,147,"If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,148,"confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,149,it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,150,She won't rest until my head's on a spike.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,151,Not just yours.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,152,She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,153,Sansa couldn't have done this.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,154,She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,155,Do you think it's a coincidence
S04E04,Oathkeeper,156,she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,157,"No, but"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,158,Sansa's not a killer.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,159,"Not yet, anyway."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,160,Where are you taking me?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,161,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,162,She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,163,You'll be safe there.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,164,Did you kill Joffrey?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,165,Did I kill Joffrey?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,166,I've been in the Vale for weeks.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,167,I know it was you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,168,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,169,There was Ser Dontos.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,170,"You used him to get me out of King's Landing,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,171,but you would never trust him to kill the King.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,172,Why not?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,173,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,174,Then perhaps it was your husband.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,175,No.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,176,How do you know?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,177,I just do.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,178,You're right. He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,179,But you were.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,180,Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,181,I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,182,The poison.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,183,I don't understand.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,184,"The Lannisters gave you wealth, power."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,185,Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,186,A man with no motive is a man no one suspects.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,187,Always keep your foes confused.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,188,"If they don't know who you are or what you want,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,189,they can't know what you plan to do next.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,190,I don't believe you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,191,"If they catch you, they'll put your head"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,192,on a spike just like my father's.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,193,You'd risk that just to confuse them?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,194,"So many men, they risk so little."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,195,They spend their lives avoiding danger.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,196,And then they die.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,197,I'd risk everything to get what I want.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,198,And what do you want?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,199,Everything.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,200,My friendship with the Lannisters was productive.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,201,"But Joffrey,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,202,"a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,203,And who could trust a friend like that?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,204,Who could trust you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,205,I don't want friends like me.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,206,My new friends are predictable.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,207,Very reasonable people.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,208,"As for what happened to Joffrey,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,209,that was something my new friends wanted very badly.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,210,Nothing like a thoughtful gift
S04E04,Oathkeeper,211,to make a new friendship grow strong.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,212,I can't believe you're going.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,213,Leaving me alone here with these people.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,214,"The time has come, my dear."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,215,There's nothing more tedious than a trial.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,216,Except perhaps these gardens.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,217,"If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,218,I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,219,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,220,No.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,221,Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,222,I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,223,"He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,224,I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,225,Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,226,"But the moment I saw my intended,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,227,with his twitchy little ferret's face
S04E04,Oathkeeper,228,"and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,229,"So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,230,I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson
S04E04,Oathkeeper,231,and happened upon his chamber.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,232,How absentminded of me.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,233,Mmm-hmm.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,234,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,235,to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,236,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,237,was what I'd given him the night before.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,238,I was good.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,239,I was very good.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,240,You are even better.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,241,But you need to act quickly.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,242,"Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,243,She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,244,"And by the time you're married, it'll be too late."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,245,"Luckily for you, the Queen Regent"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,246,is rather distracted at the moment.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,247,Mourning her dear departed boy.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,248,"Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,249,He could have done.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,250,But he didn't.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,251,"You don't know, Grandmother."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,252,But I do know.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,253,"You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,254,What? I don't understand.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,255,Shh.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,256,Don't you worry yourself about all that.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,257,You just do what needs to be done.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,258,Bring it through!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,259,And again.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,260,Very nice. Good.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,261,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,262,First thing you want to do
S04E04,Oathkeeper,263,is disarm them to try and even the odds.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,264,Let's see what you can do.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,265,"OIly, you just watch for now."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,266,I can fight.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,267,Have you ever held a sword before?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,268,I was the best archer in our hamlet.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,269,I was!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,270,I believe you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,271,We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,272,"Right now, watch and learn."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,273,You two.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,274,"Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,275,You know how to fight.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,276,You could have gone easier on him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,277,He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,278,Lord Snow.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,279,What do you think you're doing?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,280,Grenn and I were helping them.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,281,Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,282,"Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,283,but I didn't.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,284,Someone has to train them.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,285,And that someone isn't you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,286,Go find a chamber pot to empty.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,287,Go on. Do it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,288,You traitor's bastard.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,289,Give me an excuse.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,290,Mormont's not here to protect you now.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,291,Get back to work.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,292,Now!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,293,I said now!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,294,The bastard's well-liked. You're not.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,295,You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,296,For now.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,297,But you can't be acting commander forever.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,298,There will be a choosing.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,299,The old maester will insist on it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,300,You might reconsider his request to march on Craster's.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,301,Let the mutineers take care of Snow.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,302,Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,303,"A bastard, eh?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,304,Took you for highborn.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,305,My father was highborn.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,306,My mother wasn't.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,307,Name's Locke.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,308,Jon Snow.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,309,You fight well.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,310,What brought you up here?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,311,A sense of duty.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,312,I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,313,I was a game warden in the Stormlands.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,314,Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,315,I was stupid enough to get caught.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,316,Chose the Wall over losing my hand.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,317,Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,318,"Come on, get on with it."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,319,What are you waiting for? Summer?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,320,Guess I was wrong.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,321,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,322,Your Grace.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,323,How formal of you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,324,How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,325,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
S04E04,Oathkeeper,326,So one?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,327,You have one man guarding the future king?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,328,I promise you Tommen's safe.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,329,We're protecting him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,330,The way you protected Joffrey?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,331,Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,332,What?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,333,I've been wondering for months.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,334,Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,335,Why did she set you free?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,336,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,337,She hoped or did you promise?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,338,I swore by all the gods
S04E04,Oathkeeper,339,"that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,340,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,341,I wanted to get back to you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,342,Should I have told her to fuck off?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,343,"You didn't mean it, then?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,344,You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,345,Catelyn Stark's dead.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,346,"So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,347,if I told you to find that murderous little bitch
S04E04,Oathkeeper,348,"and bring me her head,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,349,would you do it?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,350,I know you went to see Tyrion.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,351,That creature who murdered our son.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,352,I had to see him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,353,I had to know for myself.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,354,And?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,355,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,356,You've always pitied him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,357,Our poor little brother.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,358,"Abused by the world, despised by his father and sister."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,359,He'd kill us all if he could.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,360,I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,361,"That will be all, Lord Commander."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,362,Ser Pounce?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,363,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,364,Kingsguard.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,365,I don't think you're supposed to be here.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,366,Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,367,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,368,Word has it I'm to be your bride.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,369,Did you know that people in arranged marriages
S04E04,Oathkeeper,370,often never meet until their wedding day?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,371,"Before we decide to spend our lives together,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,372,we ought to get to know one another.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,373,Don't you think?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,374,Yes.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,375,But if my mother found out...
S04E04,Oathkeeper,376,It can be our secret.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,377,Hmm?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,378,"If we're going to be man and wife,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,379,"we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,380,"So, Your Grace..."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,381,Yes?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,382,Tell me a secret.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,383,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,384,That's Ser Pounce.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,385,Very handsome.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,386,Joffrey didn't like him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,387,He threatened to skin him alive
S04E04,Oathkeeper,388,and mix his innards up in my food
S04E04,Oathkeeper,389,so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,390,That's very cruel.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,391,You don't strike me as cruel.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,392,No.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,393,I don't think I am.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,394,That's a relief.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,395,Because you know what happens when we marry?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,396,We say our vows in front of the High Septon.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,397,"And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,398,"When we marry, I become yours."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,399,Forever.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,400,It's getting late.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,401,I should go.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,402,May I come and visit you again?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,403,"All right, then."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,404,"Remember,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,405,our little secret.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,406,"""Ser Jaime Lannister."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,407,"""Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,408,"""At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king, Aerys II."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,409,"""Pardoned by Robert Baratheon."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,410,"""Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."""
S04E04,Oathkeeper,411,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,412,And there's still room left on mine.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,413,Valyrian steel.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,414,Mmm.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,415,It's yours.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,416,I can't accept this.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,417,It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,418,You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,419,You swore an oath
S04E04,Oathkeeper,420,to return the Stark girls to their mother.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,421,Lady Stark's dead.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,422,"Arya's probably dead, too,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,423,but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,424,I've got something else for you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,425,I hope I got your measurements right.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,426,I'll find her.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,427,For Lady Catelyn.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,428,And for you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,429,I almost forgot.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,430,I have one more gift.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,431,I don't need a squire.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,432,Of course you do.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,433,He'll slow me down.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,434,My brother owes him a debt.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,435,He's not safe here. You'll be keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,436,"I won't slow you down, ser."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,437,My lady.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,438,I promise I'll serve you well.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,439,See? He's a good lad. You'll get along.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,440,Compliments of Lord Tyrion.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,441,His axe from the Blackwater.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,442,"What are you waiting for, a kiss?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,443,Ready the lady's horse.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,444,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,445,Oathkeeper.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,446,"Goodbye, Brienne."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,447,"Come on, move."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,448,I should never have taken her away.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,449,She wasn't safe here.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,450,She's not safe out there.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,451,I should have known.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,452,You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,453,"If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,454,Castle Black could be next.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,455,I should go back for Gilly.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,456,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,457,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,458,And I remember who came after me and brought me home.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,459,"I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,460,"When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,461,all I could think about was getting my strength back
S04E04,Oathkeeper,462,so I could go and find him.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,463,I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,464,"I tried. Really, I did."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,465,How fast could they travel?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,466,A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,467,I don't know.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,468,They'd pass wildling villages.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,469,They could try and find shelter at one of them.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,470,The wildlings have joined up with Mance.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,471,Every village or sheltered place will be deserted.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,472,Except...
S04E04,Oathkeeper,473,Craster's?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,474,- You think Bran might have found... - Snow.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,475,I don't mean to interrupt.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,476,Thorne wants to see you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,477,"Your foray to Craster's Keep,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,478,I'll sanction it.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,479,But I won't order anyone to go with you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,480,Volunteers only.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,481,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,482,Brothers.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,483,I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep
S04E04,Oathkeeper,484,to capture the mutineers holed up there
S04E04,Oathkeeper,485,or kill them.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,486,I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,487,"There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,488,"and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,489,but we have to do this.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,490,Our survival may depend on us getting to
S04E04,Oathkeeper,491,these mutineers before Mance does.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,492,They know the Wall. They know our defences.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,493,"If Mance learns what they know, we're lost."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,494,"But if that's not enough,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,495,then consider this.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,496,"If the Night's Watch are truly brothers,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,497,then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,498,He lived and died for the Watch
S04E04,Oathkeeper,499,and he was betrayed by his own men.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,500,Stabbed in the back by cowards.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,501,He deserved far better.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,502,All we can give him now is justice.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,503,Who will join me?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,504,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,505,Then let me say my vows.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,506,"If it's a fight you're heading for,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,507,then you need men who know how.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,508,"Thank you, brothers."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,509,"No, don't."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,510,"Don't, please."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,511,Please don't.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,512,Ow! You're hurting me.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,513,Karl Tanner from Gin Alley
S04E04,Oathkeeper,514,drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,515,"Any command for us, Lord Commander?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,516,What's that?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,517,Fuck 'em till they're dead?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,518,"Did you hear that, boys?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,519,Fuck 'em till they're dead.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,520,Rast.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,521,Go outside and feed the beast.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,522,We should kill that thing.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,523,"You should shut your fucking hole,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,524,ugly little cunt.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,525,You look like a fucking ballsack. Ugly.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,526,Look at your stupid cunt face.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,527,I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,528,Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,529,Seven silvers.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,530,They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,531,None of them cocksuckers got away from me.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,532,Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,533,Maybe it's time.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,534,What do you think? Eh?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,535,Maybe you're the man.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,536,"Eh, cunt?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,537,I wouldn't stand a chance.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,538,None of us would.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,539,I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,540,A fucking legend!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,541,"I would take any knight, any time."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,542,You fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,543,A gift for the gods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,544,A gift for the gods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,545,What the fuck is that?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,546,Craster's last child. A boy.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,547,What am I supposed to do with him?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,548,What did Craster do?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,549,Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,550,All right.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,551,Don't need another mouth to feed.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,552,Hand him over.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,553,He didn't kill them.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,554,He offered them.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,555,To who?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,556,To the gods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,557,The White Walkers.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,558,A gift for the gods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,559,A gift for the gods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,560,A gift for the gods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,561,Shut up!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,562,"So,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,563,if it worked for him...
S04E04,Oathkeeper,564,...let's give the Walkers what they want.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,565,Rast is headed that way.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,566,Pink-eyed fuck.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,567,You thirsty?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,568,Fuck!
S04E04,Oathkeeper,569,Hodor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,570,Do you hear that?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,571,Is that a baby?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,572,It's coming.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,573,I'm going out there.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,574,"No, we need to stay together."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,575,I'm going.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,576,Bran.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,577,Hodor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,578,"- Bran, what happened? - It's Summer. He's hurt."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,579,They've caught him in a trap.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,580,Who?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,581,"I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,582,They have Ghost.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,583,They're Night's Watch.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,584,Look.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,585,Jon might be here.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,586,"If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,587,"They might have been Night's Watch once, not any more."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,588,We're not safe here. We need to go.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,589,No.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,590,"Bran, we need to go now."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,591,I'm not leaving without Summer.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,592,Can you remember where the cage was?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,593,The east side of the keep.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,594,"If I'm not back soon, we'll meet..."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,595,Hodor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,596,Hodor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,597,Hodor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,598,Hodor.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,599,"If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,600,Help him up.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,601,This is nice.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,602,Fine leather.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,603,You're no wildling.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,604,Important. Highborn.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,605,Who are you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,606,"You see, where I come from,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,607,"a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,608,I'd lose me right hand.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,609,"But we're a long way from home, aren't we?"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,610,"And then the two of you,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,611,fancy-Iooking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,612,Isn't that a bit odd?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,613,I like your curly hair.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,614,My mom had curls like that.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,615,Beautiful brown curls.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,616,Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,617,Hmm?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,618,"See, you haven't played this game before."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,619,"A highborn hostage,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,620,that's valuable.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,621,"But three of them,"
S04E04,Oathkeeper,622,that's a lot of mouths to feed.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,623,What the fuck's wrong with him?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,624,Come here.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,625,"No, please."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,626,"Please, let me help him."
S04E04,Oathkeeper,627,Who are you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,628,Please.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,629,Who are you?
S04E04,Oathkeeper,630,I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,631,It's Jon Snow's brother.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,632,It's Meera. I'm right here.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,633,And I thought this was gonna be another boring day.
S04E04,Oathkeeper,634,I'm right here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,1,May the Warrior grant him courage
S04E05,First Of His Name,2,and protect him in these perilous times.
S04E05,First Of His Name,3,May the Smith grant him strength
S04E05,First Of His Name,4,that he might bear this heavy burden.
S04E05,First Of His Name,5,"And may the Crone,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,6,"she that knows the fate of all men,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,7,show him the path he must walk
S04E05,First Of His Name,8,and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.
S04E05,First Of His Name,9,"In the light of the Seven,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,10,"I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,11,"First of His Name,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,12,King of the Andals and the First Men
S04E05,First Of His Name,13,and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
S04E05,First Of His Name,14,Long may he reign!
S04E05,First Of His Name,15,Long may he reign!
S04E05,First Of His Name,16,Special day.
S04E05,First Of His Name,17,Your Grace.
S04E05,First Of His Name,18,Your Grace.
S04E05,First Of His Name,19,Your Grace.
S04E05,First Of His Name,20,Your Grace.
S04E05,First Of His Name,21,There he is.
S04E05,First Of His Name,22,Long may he reign.
S04E05,First Of His Name,23,Long may he reign.
S04E05,First Of His Name,24,He sits the throne like he was born to it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,25,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,26,"No, he wasn't."
S04E05,First Of His Name,27,You still mourn for Joffrey?
S04E05,First Of His Name,28,He was my husband. My king.
S04E05,First Of His Name,29,He would have been your nightmare.
S04E05,First Of His Name,30,"Your Grace, I feel..."
S04E05,First Of His Name,31,You knew exactly what he was.
S04E05,First Of His Name,32,"I did, too."
S04E05,First Of His Name,33,You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.
S04E05,First Of His Name,34,Doesn't matter what they do.
S04E05,First Of His Name,35,"And what he did, it shocked me."
S04E05,First Of His Name,36,Do you think I'm easily shocked?
S04E05,First Of His Name,37,No.
S04E05,First Of His Name,38,The things he did shocked me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,39,He's only a boy.
S04E05,First Of His Name,40,"A good, decent boy. He always has been."
S04E05,First Of His Name,41,"Who was the last decent king, I wonder?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,42,He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,43,"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,44,For all the horror that put him there.
S04E05,First Of His Name,45,He will need help
S04E05,First Of His Name,46,if he's going to rule well.
S04E05,First Of His Name,47,He has you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,48,A mother is not enough.
S04E05,First Of His Name,49,You're still interested in being queen?
S04E05,First Of His Name,50,After all that's happened?
S04E05,First Of His Name,51,"It sounds strange, but I am..."
S04E05,First Of His Name,52,"I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next."
S04E05,First Of His Name,53,"It would be a great honour, of course."
S04E05,First Of His Name,54,But I will have to speak to my father about it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,55,"Yes, speak to your father."
S04E05,First Of His Name,56,I'll speak to mine.
S04E05,First Of His Name,57,We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
S04E05,First Of His Name,58,I won't even know what to call you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,59,Sister?
S04E05,First Of His Name,60,Or Mother?
S04E05,First Of His Name,61,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
S04E05,First Of His Name,62,Murdered at his own wedding.
S04E05,First Of His Name,63,"And we've taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace."
S04E05,First Of His Name,64,The Second Sons took the navy.
S04E05,First Of His Name,65,Who told you to?
S04E05,First Of His Name,66,No one.
S04E05,First Of His Name,67,So why did you do it?
S04E05,First Of His Name,68,I heard you liked ships.
S04E05,First Of His Name,69,How many ships?
S04E05,First Of His Name,70,"93, Your Grace."
S04E05,First Of His Name,71,How many men can they carry?
S04E05,First Of His Name,72,"9,300, not counting sailors."
S04E05,First Of His Name,73,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
S04E05,First Of His Name,74,The Lannisters have more.
S04E05,First Of His Name,75,They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.
S04E05,First Of His Name,76,"They're tired, dispersed."
S04E05,First Of His Name,77,And now their king is dead.
S04E05,First Of His Name,78,"8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons"
S04E05,First Of His Name,79,sailing into Blackwater Bay
S04E05,First Of His Name,80,and storming the gates without warning.
S04E05,First Of His Name,81,It's hard to say. It could be enough.
S04E05,First Of His Name,82,But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,83,"10,000 men can't conquer Westeros."
S04E05,First Of His Name,84,The old houses will flock to our queen
S04E05,First Of His Name,85,when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
S04E05,First Of His Name,86,"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,87,as they always have.
S04E05,First Of His Name,88,There's other news.
S04E05,First Of His Name,89,From Yunkai.
S04E05,First Of His Name,90,"Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,91,the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.
S04E05,First Of His Name,92,They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind
S04E05,First Of His Name,93,and sworn to take revenge against you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,94,"And in Astapor,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,95,the council you installed to rule over the city
S04E05,First Of His Name,96,has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon
S04E05,First Of His Name,97,"who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
S04E05,First Of His Name,98,Please leave me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,99,"Not you, Jorah."
S04E05,First Of His Name,100,It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
S04E05,First Of His Name,101,You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind.
S04E05,First Of His Name,102,A boy sits on the Iron Throne.
S04E05,First Of His Name,103,A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,104,They've never been more vulnerable.
S04E05,First Of His Name,105,You counselled me against rashness once in Qarth.
S04E05,First Of His Name,106,I didn't listen.
S04E05,First Of His Name,107,That all worked out well.
S04E05,First Of His Name,108,How can I rule seven kingdoms
S04E05,First Of His Name,109,if I can't control Slaver's Bay?
S04E05,First Of His Name,110,"Why should anyone trust me,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,111,follow me?
S04E05,First Of His Name,112,"You're a Targaryen,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,113,the Mother of Dragons.
S04E05,First Of His Name,114,I need to be more than that.
S04E05,First Of His Name,115,I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.
S04E05,First Of His Name,116,I will not sail for Westeros.
S04E05,First Of His Name,117,"What, then?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,118,I will do what queens do.
S04E05,First Of His Name,119,I will rule.
S04E05,First Of His Name,120,Pull up your hood.
S04E05,First Of His Name,121,A memorable shade.
S04E05,First Of His Name,122,But how would they know?
S04E05,First Of His Name,123,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?
S04E05,First Of His Name,124,Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,125,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
S04E05,First Of His Name,126,The mountains are impassable.
S04E05,First Of His Name,127,"If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate."
S04E05,First Of His Name,128,"It doesn't matter how large your army is,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,129,"if you attack this gate, you do it on this road,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,130,"three men abreast,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,131,and get slaughtered like goats.
S04E05,First Of His Name,132,"The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,133,but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.
S04E05,First Of His Name,134,And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.
S04E05,First Of His Name,135,"Not once in 1,000 years."
S04E05,First Of His Name,136,"Know your strengths, use them wisely,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,137,"and one man can be worth 10,000."
S04E05,First Of His Name,138,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
S04E05,First Of His Name,139,Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
S04E05,First Of His Name,140,Stand to.
S04E05,First Of His Name,141,Stand to!
S04E05,First Of His Name,142,"Welcome back, Lord Baelish."
S04E05,First Of His Name,143,Uncle Petyr!
S04E05,First Of His Name,144,My lord.
S04E05,First Of His Name,145,Oh.
S04E05,First Of His Name,146,I have brought you a gift.
S04E05,First Of His Name,147,Lord Baelish.
S04E05,First Of His Name,148,- My lady. - Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,149,A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
S04E05,First Of His Name,150,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn."
S04E05,First Of His Name,151,"- My name is... - Oh, do take down that hood, child."
S04E05,First Of His Name,152,Don't you think I know who you are?
S04E05,First Of His Name,153,You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business
S04E05,First Of His Name,154,without knowing what that business was?
S04E05,First Of His Name,155,I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,156,My flesh and blood.
S04E05,First Of His Name,157,"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
S04E05,First Of His Name,158,You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
S04E05,First Of His Name,159,- I understand. - No one can know you're here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,160,It would put us in a very precarious position.
S04E05,First Of His Name,161,I would never say a thing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,162,The Lannisters want to destroy us.
S04E05,First Of His Name,163,They've been trying for years.
S04E05,First Of His Name,164,Now they know what it feels like.
S04E05,First Of His Name,165,Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
S04E05,First Of His Name,166,"They did, and my father's."
S04E05,First Of His Name,167,"They killed my father, too, with poison."
S04E05,First Of His Name,168,"I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,169,but Mother said I couldn't.
S04E05,First Of His Name,170,Make him fly?
S04E05,First Of His Name,171,Through the Moon Door.
S04E05,First Of His Name,172,"And on top of everything else,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,173,they made you marry that filthy troll.
S04E05,First Of His Name,174,They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
S04E05,First Of His Name,175,I don't believe that.
S04E05,First Of His Name,176,Did he force himself on you?
S04E05,First Of His Name,177,- No. We never... - Good.
S04E05,First Of His Name,178,"Robin, this is your cousin Sansa."
S04E05,First Of His Name,179,But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone
S04E05,First Of His Name,180,but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand?
S04E05,First Of His Name,181,"Sansa, this is my son Robin."
S04E05,First Of His Name,182,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
S04E05,First Of His Name,183,"Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
S04E05,First Of His Name,184,Go. We'll speak soon.
S04E05,First Of His Name,185,What took you so long?
S04E05,First Of His Name,186,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,187,"extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
S04E05,First Of His Name,188,She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
S04E05,First Of His Name,189,Let's get married tonight.
S04E05,First Of His Name,190,Ought we not...
S04E05,First Of His Name,191,...inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
S04E05,First Of His Name,192,There's only one Lord of the Vale.
S04E05,First Of His Name,193,The others can all hang.
S04E05,First Of His Name,194,"Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,195,- trying to get their claws in me. - I do think that we could wait until...
S04E05,First Of His Name,196,"I'm done waiting, Petyr."
S04E05,First Of His Name,197,We had our wedding night many years ago.
S04E05,First Of His Name,198,Or don't you remember?
S04E05,First Of His Name,199,Like it was yesterday.
S04E05,First Of His Name,200,What wife would do for you the things I've done?
S04E05,First Of His Name,201,What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?
S04E05,First Of His Name,202,When you gave me those drops
S04E05,First Of His Name,203,"and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,204,my husband's wine.
S04E05,First Of His Name,205,When you told me to write a letter to Cat
S04E05,First Of His Name,206,telling her it was the...
S04E05,First Of His Name,207,The deed is done.
S04E05,First Of His Name,208,Faded into nothing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,209,Only speaking of it can make it real.
S04E05,First Of His Name,210,"Tonight it is, then."
S04E05,First Of His Name,211,Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.
S04E05,First Of His Name,212,"Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the Septon immediately."
S04E05,First Of His Name,213,I'm warning you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,214,I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,215,So loud they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
S04E05,First Of His Name,216,When will the wedding take place in your mind?
S04E05,First Of His Name,217,CERSEl: As soon as decency permits.
S04E05,First Of His Name,218,After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother
S04E05,First Of His Name,219,and Margaery to mourn her husband.
S04E05,First Of His Name,220,- A fortnight? - That seems reasonable.
S04E05,First Of His Name,221,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,222,no 77-course meals.
S04E05,First Of His Name,223,And your wedding to Loras?
S04E05,First Of His Name,224,Shortly after Tommen's.
S04E05,First Of His Name,225,- Shortly? - A fortnight.
S04E05,First Of His Name,226,I know you don't like them.
S04E05,First Of His Name,227,I didn't like your husband.
S04E05,First Of His Name,228,Used to pat me on the back a lot.
S04E05,First Of His Name,229,I didn't trust him.
S04E05,First Of His Name,230,We had that in common.
S04E05,First Of His Name,231,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
S04E05,First Of His Name,232,Then whom can we trust?
S04E05,First Of His Name,233,Ourselves alone.
S04E05,First Of His Name,234,The Tyrells
S04E05,First Of His Name,235,are our only true rivals in terms of resources
S04E05,First Of His Name,236,and we need them on our side.
S04E05,First Of His Name,237,Robert wasn't particularly rich.
S04E05,First Of His Name,238,Robert had me funding him.
S04E05,First Of His Name,239,Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
S04E05,First Of His Name,240,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
S04E05,First Of His Name,241,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
S04E05,First Of His Name,242,Haven't a clue.
S04E05,First Of His Name,243,Your best guess.
S04E05,First Of His Name,244,"Pounds, tons, ounces?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,245,Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
S04E05,First Of His Name,246,Can't be.
S04E05,First Of His Name,247,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
S04E05,First Of His Name,248,Then how do we pay for anything?
S04E05,First Of His Name,249,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
S04E05,First Of His Name,250,How much?
S04E05,First Of His Name,251,A tremendous amount.
S04E05,First Of His Name,252,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
S04E05,First Of His Name,253,The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
S04E05,First Of His Name,254,Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
S04E05,First Of His Name,255,And a temple is comprised of stones.
S04E05,First Of His Name,256,One stone crumbles and another takes its place.
S04E05,First Of His Name,257,"And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more."
S04E05,First Of His Name,258,"That's what the Iron Bank is, a temple."
S04E05,First Of His Name,259,We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,260,You can't run from them. You can't cheat them.
S04E05,First Of His Name,261,You can't sway them with excuses.
S04E05,First Of His Name,262,"If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,263,you pay it back.
S04E05,First Of His Name,264,Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal.
S04E05,First Of His Name,265,"It's for the good of the family, I understand that."
S04E05,First Of His Name,266,I'm not sure my brothers do.
S04E05,First Of His Name,267,I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.
S04E05,First Of His Name,268,"And as a mother, that is your right."
S04E05,First Of His Name,269,"But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
S04E05,First Of His Name,270,I respect that.
S04E05,First Of His Name,271,We don't need to discuss it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,272,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.
S04E05,First Of His Name,273,You've started wars to protect this family.
S04E05,First Of His Name,274,Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.
S04E05,First Of His Name,275,What does Tyrion deserve
S04E05,First Of His Name,276,for lighting that future on fire?
S04E05,First Of His Name,277,Joffrey.
S04E05,First Of His Name,278,Cersei.
S04E05,First Of His Name,279,Walder Frey.
S04E05,First Of His Name,280,Meryn Trant.
S04E05,First Of His Name,281,Tywin Lannister.
S04E05,First Of His Name,282,The Red Woman.
S04E05,First Of His Name,283,Beric Dondarrion.
S04E05,First Of His Name,284,Thoros of Myr.
S04E05,First Of His Name,285,Ilyn Payne.
S04E05,First Of His Name,286,The Mountain.
S04E05,First Of His Name,287,Would you shut up?
S04E05,First Of His Name,288,I can't sleep until I say the names.
S04E05,First Of His Name,289,The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
S04E05,First Of His Name,290,Only the ones I'm going to kill.
S04E05,First Of His Name,291,Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.
S04E05,First Of His Name,292,Better than most.
S04E05,First Of His Name,293,"We come across my brother,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,294,maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
S04E05,First Of His Name,295,"If he were here right now, what would you do?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,296,I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep.
S04E05,First Of His Name,297,"Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
S04E05,First Of His Name,298,I'm almost done.
S04E05,First Of His Name,299,Only one name left.
S04E05,First Of His Name,300,Go on.
S04E05,First Of His Name,301,The Hound.
S04E05,First Of His Name,302,Thank you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,303,Your mother always had a sweet tooth.
S04E05,First Of His Name,304,"- Really? - Oh, yes."
S04E05,First Of His Name,305,"At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,306,"candied almonds, custard."
S04E05,First Of His Name,307,Anything sweet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,308,"Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals."
S04E05,First Of His Name,309,Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.
S04E05,First Of His Name,310,It was important that she remain desirable
S04E05,First Of His Name,311,so Father could arrange a good match for her
S04E05,First Of His Name,312,and she was starting to get fat.
S04E05,First Of His Name,313,My mother fat?
S04E05,First Of His Name,314,She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
S04E05,First Of His Name,315,This is before she married your father and moved to the North.
S04E05,First Of His Name,316,"By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers."
S04E05,First Of His Name,317,Marriage changes people.
S04E05,First Of His Name,318,I didn't mean for you to stop. Enjoy them.
S04E05,First Of His Name,319,How do you like them?
S04E05,First Of His Name,320,They're delicious.
S04E05,First Of His Name,321,Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,322,"Oh, gods, no."
S04E05,First Of His Name,323,Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,324,He knew you liked lemon cakes.
S04E05,First Of His Name,325,He's so kind.
S04E05,First Of His Name,326,He really cares for you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,327,Think where you'd be without him.
S04E05,First Of His Name,328,"In their clutches, on trial for murder."
S04E05,First Of His Name,329,Yes. I'm very lucky.
S04E05,First Of His Name,330,He feels responsible for you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,331,"- Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful. - Why?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,332,Why does he feel responsible for you?
S04E05,First Of His Name,333,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
S04E05,First Of His Name,334,- Loved your mother. - No.
S04E05,First Of His Name,335,That's what you wanted to say.
S04E05,First Of His Name,336,"- He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you. - Your mother never loved him."
S04E05,First Of His Name,337,Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,338,The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.
S04E05,First Of His Name,339,"Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon."
S04E05,First Of His Name,340,He almost killed Petyr in a duel.
S04E05,First Of His Name,341,And your mother loved him anyway.
S04E05,First Of His Name,342,"And now Petyr is risking his life to save you,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,343,the daughter of a woman who didn't love him.
S04E05,First Of His Name,344,No more than those whores in his brothels.
S04E05,First Of His Name,345,- Has he told you about them? - No.
S04E05,First Of His Name,346,"He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,347,they let him do with their bodies?
S04E05,First Of His Name,348,- Never. - Are you pregnant?
S04E05,First Of His Name,349,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never..."
S04E05,First Of His Name,350,I wasn't asking about Tyrion.
S04E05,First Of His Name,351,What have you let Petyr do with your body?
S04E05,First Of His Name,352,"- Aunt Lysa, no, I... - Your young, pretty body."
S04E05,First Of His Name,353,- Nothing. I'm a virgin. - Don't lie to me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,354,You're hurting me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,355,I'll know if you lie.
S04E05,First Of His Name,356,"I'm a virgin, I swear it."
S04E05,First Of His Name,357,"He loves you, Aunt Lysa."
S04E05,First Of His Name,358,All he says is that I'm stupid.
S04E05,First Of His Name,359,"I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,360,"and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth."
S04E05,First Of His Name,361,And I swear to you that he has never touched me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,362,"Not once, not ever."
S04E05,First Of His Name,363,It's all right.
S04E05,First Of His Name,364,It will all be all right.
S04E05,First Of His Name,365,You'll be a widow soon.
S04E05,First Of His Name,366,They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king
S04E05,First Of His Name,367,and you'll be free to marry Robin.
S04E05,First Of His Name,368,You'll be the Lady of the Vale.
S04E05,First Of His Name,369,Hmm.
S04E05,First Of His Name,370,Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
S04E05,First Of His Name,371,"Yes, my lady, when I was young."
S04E05,First Of His Name,372,"There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though."
S04E05,First Of His Name,373,He preferred litters.
S04E05,First Of His Name,374,Perhaps you should have stayed with him.
S04E05,First Of His Name,375,It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,376,"It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
S04E05,First Of His Name,377,That's a long way off.
S04E05,First Of His Name,378,"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black."
S04E05,First Of His Name,379,"If I were her, that's where I'd go."
S04E05,First Of His Name,380,Feel free to stop at any point.
S04E05,First Of His Name,381,"Never, my lady. I'm your squire."
S04E05,First Of His Name,382,I've made it this far in the world without a squire.
S04E05,First Of His Name,383,I don't see why I need one now.
S04E05,First Of His Name,384,"- All knights have squires, my lady. - I'm not a knight."
S04E05,First Of His Name,385,"And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
S04E05,First Of His Name,386,"I swore an oath, my lady."
S04E05,First Of His Name,387,I am releasing you from that oath.
S04E05,First Of His Name,388,That means you could leave.
S04E05,First Of His Name,389,I know.
S04E05,First Of His Name,390,What do you think will happen if you leave?
S04E05,First Of His Name,391,They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
S04E05,First Of His Name,392,- The hell you doing? - Practising.
S04E05,First Of His Name,393,"- What, ways to die? - No one's going to kill me."
S04E05,First Of His Name,394,They will if you nance around like that.
S04E05,First Of His Name,395,That's no way to fight.
S04E05,First Of His Name,396,It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,397,Dancing?
S04E05,First Of His Name,398,Maybe you ought to put on a dress.
S04E05,First Of His Name,399,Who taught you that shite?
S04E05,First Of His Name,400,The greatest swordsman who ever lived.
S04E05,First Of His Name,401,"Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
S04E05,First Of His Name,402,Braavos.
S04E05,First Of His Name,403,"Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet."
S04E05,First Of His Name,404,They all are.
S04E05,First Of His Name,405,What do you know about anything?
S04E05,First Of His Name,406,I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
S04E05,First Of His Name,407,- It was not. - Was? He dead?
S04E05,First Of His Name,408,- Yes. - How?
S04E05,First Of His Name,409,- He was killed. - Who by?
S04E05,First Of His Name,410,- Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn's on my... - Meryn Trant?
S04E05,First Of His Name,411,The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
S04E05,First Of His Name,412,- He was outnumbered. - Any boy whore with a sword
S04E05,First Of His Name,413,could beat three Meryn Trants.
S04E05,First Of His Name,414,Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armour. Just a stick.
S04E05,First Of His Name,415,The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword?
S04E05,First Of His Name,416,All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,417,"Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend."
S04E05,First Of His Name,418,Dead like all the rest of your friends.
S04E05,First Of His Name,419,Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not
S04E05,First Of His Name,420,'cause Trant had armour and a big fucking sword.
S04E05,First Of His Name,421,Your Grace.
S04E05,First Of His Name,422,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
S04E05,First Of His Name,423,"A poem, actually."
S04E05,First Of His Name,424,May I show you the gardens?
S04E05,First Of His Name,425,I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
S04E05,First Of His Name,426,"No, you couldn't."
S04E05,First Of His Name,427,I didn't realise you were a poet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,428,Not a very good one.
S04E05,First Of His Name,429,For your paramour?
S04E05,First Of His Name,430,For one of my daughters.
S04E05,First Of His Name,431,"You have several, don't you?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,432,Eight.
S04E05,First Of His Name,433,Eight?
S04E05,First Of His Name,434,Eight daughters?
S04E05,First Of His Name,435,The fifth is difficult.
S04E05,First Of His Name,436,I named her after my sister Elia.
S04E05,First Of His Name,437,- Beautiful name. - Yes.
S04E05,First Of His Name,438,But I can't say it without turning sad.
S04E05,First Of His Name,439,"And after I turn sad,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,440,I grow angry.
S04E05,First Of His Name,441,Perhaps that's why she's difficult.
S04E05,First Of His Name,442,"The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,443,Which joke is that?
S04E05,First Of His Name,444,You're a prince of Dorne.
S04E05,First Of His Name,445,A legendary fighter.
S04E05,First Of His Name,446,A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.
S04E05,First Of His Name,447,But you could not save your sister.
S04E05,First Of His Name,448,I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive.
S04E05,First Of His Name,449,But I could not save my son.
S04E05,First Of His Name,450,What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
S04E05,First Of His Name,451,We can avenge them.
S04E05,First Of His Name,452,"Yes, we can avenge them."
S04E05,First Of His Name,453,You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
S04E05,First Of His Name,454,I know he did.
S04E05,First Of His Name,455,We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
S04E05,First Of His Name,456,"We'll have a trial, anyway."
S04E05,First Of His Name,457,I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
S04E05,First Of His Name,458,"The last time I saw her,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,459,she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens.
S04E05,First Of His Name,460,Laughing in the sun.
S04E05,First Of His Name,461,I want to believe that.
S04E05,First Of His Name,462,I want to believe she's happy.
S04E05,First Of His Name,463,You have my word.
S04E05,First Of His Name,464,We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
S04E05,First Of His Name,465,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls."
S04E05,First Of His Name,466,Would you bring her a gift for me?
S04E05,First Of His Name,467,I wasn't there for her nameday.
S04E05,First Of His Name,468,I don't know when I'll see her again.
S04E05,First Of His Name,469,Anything at all.
S04E05,First Of His Name,470,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months.
S04E05,First Of His Name,471,Myrcella loves the open water.
S04E05,First Of His Name,472,I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
S04E05,First Of His Name,473,Please tell her
S04E05,First Of His Name,474,her mother misses her very much.
S04E05,First Of His Name,475,"Oh, no."
S04E05,First Of His Name,476,"No, no."
S04E05,First Of His Name,477,Hells.
S04E05,First Of His Name,478,Gods.
S04E05,First Of His Name,479,Did you remove the skin?
S04E05,First Of His Name,480,"No, my lady."
S04E05,First Of His Name,481,Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
S04E05,First Of His Name,482,"No, my lady."
S04E05,First Of His Name,483,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
S04E05,First Of His Name,484,"No, my lady."
S04E05,First Of His Name,485,That was the cooks.
S04E05,First Of His Name,486,What are you doing?
S04E05,First Of His Name,487,I'm helping you with your armour.
S04E05,First Of His Name,488,"I've been removing my own armour for quite some time, thank you very much."
S04E05,First Of His Name,489,What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
S04E05,First Of His Name,490,I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished.
S04E05,First Of His Name,491,I kept his clothing and linens clean.
S04E05,First Of His Name,492,Carried his messages and returned the replies.
S04E05,First Of His Name,493,Mostly I poured wine.
S04E05,First Of His Name,494,"Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,495,did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
S04E05,First Of His Name,496,I killed a man.
S04E05,First Of His Name,497,Who?
S04E05,First Of His Name,498,A Kingsguard.
S04E05,First Of His Name,499,He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
S04E05,First Of His Name,500,How did you kill a Kingsguard?
S04E05,First Of His Name,501,I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
S04E05,First Of His Name,502,Bloody ridiculous.
S04E05,First Of His Name,503,Help me with these straps.
S04E05,First Of His Name,504,Hey.
S04E05,First Of His Name,505,Get up.
S04E05,First Of His Name,506,Get up.
S04E05,First Of His Name,507,"That's it, lad, put it inside."
S04E05,First Of His Name,508,Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,509,- Aye. We need you in the journey. - I promise I'll do it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,510,I've got to have a piss.
S04E05,First Of His Name,511,Now keep quiet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,512,You need water.
S04E05,First Of His Name,513,It doesn't matter.
S04E05,First Of His Name,514,Of course it matters.
S04E05,First Of His Name,515,You mustn't let anything stop you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,516,They already have stopped me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,517,No.
S04E05,First Of His Name,518,You're not here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,519,You're far from here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,520,What does that mean?
S04E05,First Of His Name,521,At the hill.
S04E05,First Of His Name,522,A great weirwood tree.
S04E05,First Of His Name,523,"You've seen it, too."
S04E05,First Of His Name,524,"Meera and I,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,525,"even Hodor,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,526,we're only here to guide you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,527,He's waiting for you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,528,We have to find it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,529,You have to make it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,530,We will.
S04E05,First Of His Name,531,This isn't the end.
S04E05,First Of His Name,532,Not for you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,533,Not yet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,534,How...
S04E05,First Of His Name,535,...will we know the end?
S04E05,First Of His Name,536,You'll know.
S04E05,First Of His Name,537,Brothers.
S04E05,First Of His Name,538,You do move quiet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,539,- How many? - Eleven men.
S04E05,First Of His Name,540,Most of them already drunk.
S04E05,First Of His Name,541,No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world.
S04E05,First Of His Name,542,We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
S04E05,First Of His Name,543,Karl was the top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.
S04E05,First Of His Name,544,I've seen what he can do with a knife.
S04E05,First Of His Name,545,Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
S04E05,First Of His Name,546,Not yet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,547,There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
S04E05,First Of His Name,548,Why?
S04E05,First Of His Name,549,They've got some hounds chained up inside.
S04E05,First Of His Name,550,"Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
S04E05,First Of His Name,551,New moon tonight.
S04E05,First Of His Name,552,Get some rest.
S04E05,First Of His Name,553,We move at sundown.
S04E05,First Of His Name,554,I've always liked a girl with curls.
S04E05,First Of His Name,555,A touch of class.
S04E05,First Of His Name,556,You take whatever's left.
S04E05,First Of His Name,557,Get her up.
S04E05,First Of His Name,558,Stop.
S04E05,First Of His Name,559,- Stop. What are you doing? - Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,560,- Hodor. - Stop.
S04E05,First Of His Name,561,Stop!
S04E05,First Of His Name,562,- Hodor. - Stop!
S04E05,First Of His Name,563,- Please. - Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,564,"- Please, get off her! - Hodor."
S04E05,First Of His Name,565,"Please, leave her alone!"
S04E05,First Of His Name,566,"Please, stop. Stop."
S04E05,First Of His Name,567,- What are you doing? Leave her alone! - Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,568,No!
S04E05,First Of His Name,569,"Shh, shh, shh."
S04E05,First Of His Name,570,Shh.
S04E05,First Of His Name,571,"You've got pretty hair, don't you?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,572,Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you
S04E05,First Of His Name,573,"doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,574,"You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,575,No dresses for you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,576,"You like it rough, don't you?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,577,"You like it in the gutter, don't you?"
S04E05,First Of His Name,578,"If you let my sister go, I can help you."
S04E05,First Of His Name,579,- You can help me? - I can.
S04E05,First Of His Name,580,And how you gonna do that?
S04E05,First Of His Name,581,I have the sight. I can see things.
S04E05,First Of His Name,582,That's very helpful.
S04E05,First Of His Name,583,Things that haven't happened yet.
S04E05,First Of His Name,584,What a fine thing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,585,A fine thing.
S04E05,First Of His Name,586,Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister?
S04E05,First Of His Name,587,What they're going to do?
S04E05,First Of His Name,588,No.
S04E05,First Of His Name,589,Don't close your eyes.
S04E05,First Of His Name,590,I saw you die tonight.
S04E05,First Of His Name,591,I saw your body burn.
S04E05,First Of His Name,592,I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
S04E05,First Of His Name,593,To arms!
S04E05,First Of His Name,594,"They're here, the Night's Watch."
S04E05,First Of His Name,595,"Rescue party is here, lads."
S04E05,First Of His Name,596,Lady.
S04E05,First Of His Name,597,- Is Jon with you? - Aye.
S04E05,First Of His Name,598,I'll take you to him.
S04E05,First Of His Name,599,You're Brandon Stark?
S04E05,First Of His Name,600,Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,601,"The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy."
S04E05,First Of His Name,602,Jon!
S04E05,First Of His Name,603,Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats.
S04E05,First Of His Name,604,Starting with the idiot.
S04E05,First Of His Name,605,Do you hear?
S04E05,First Of His Name,606,Hodor!
S04E05,First Of His Name,607,Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,608,Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,609,Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,610,Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,611,"Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose."
S04E05,First Of His Name,612,"- Hodor, get his knife. - Hodor."
S04E05,First Of His Name,613,"Cut me loose, Hodor."
S04E05,First Of His Name,614,"Jojen and Meera, free them."
S04E05,First Of His Name,615,Go!
S04E05,First Of His Name,616,Jon.
S04E05,First Of His Name,617,Jon!
S04E05,First Of His Name,618,"If he sees you, he won't let you go north."
S04E05,First Of His Name,619,- He's my brother. - And wants to protect you.
S04E05,First Of His Name,620,He'll take you back to Castle Black.
S04E05,First Of His Name,621,They're coming from that way as well!
S04E05,First Of His Name,622,You have to decide.
S04E05,First Of His Name,623,Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
S04E05,First Of His Name,624,- Hodor. - Hodor.
S04E05,First Of His Name,625,We need to free Summer.
S04E05,First Of His Name,626,And we need to go.
S04E05,First Of His Name,627,Lord Snow.
S04E05,First Of His Name,628,Are you bringing me back for trial?
S04E05,First Of His Name,629,We had a good thing here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,630,We were free men.
S04E05,First Of His Name,631,You'll never be free.
S04E05,First Of His Name,632,You'll never know what that's like.
S04E05,First Of His Name,633,You learn how to fight in a castle?
S04E05,First Of His Name,634,"Some old man teach you how to stand,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,635,how to parry?
S04E05,First Of His Name,636,How to fight with honour?
S04E05,First Of His Name,637,You know what's wrong with honour?
S04E05,First Of His Name,638,You.
S04E05,First Of His Name,639,Are you all right?
S04E05,First Of His Name,640,Come with me.
S04E05,First Of His Name,641,Come on.
S04E05,First Of His Name,642,We lost four brothers?
S04E05,First Of His Name,643,Five.
S04E05,First Of His Name,644,What the seven hells could do that to a man?
S04E05,First Of His Name,645,I count 10 dead mutineers.
S04E05,First Of His Name,646,Locke said there were 11 of them.
S04E05,First Of His Name,647,Where's Rast?
S04E05,First Of His Name,648,- Here's another. - Jon.
S04E05,First Of His Name,649,Where in seven hells?
S04E05,First Of His Name,650,Come here.
S04E05,First Of His Name,651,"I missed you, boy."
S04E05,First Of His Name,652,What should we do with this lot?
S04E05,First Of His Name,653,It's not safe for you here on your own.
S04E05,First Of His Name,654,Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance.
S04E05,First Of His Name,655,Come with us to Castle Black.
S04E05,First Of His Name,656,We can find you work. Keep you safe.
S04E05,First Of His Name,657,"Meaning all respect, ser crow,"
S04E05,First Of His Name,658,Craster beat us and worse.
S04E05,First Of His Name,659,Your brother crows beat us and worse.
S04E05,First Of His Name,660,We'll find our own way.
S04E05,First Of His Name,661,You want to stay here?
S04E05,First Of His Name,662,In Craster's Keep?
S04E05,First Of His Name,663,Burn it to the ground
S04E05,First Of His Name,664,and all the dead with it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,1,"Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that..."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,2,We've been here since midday.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,3,Easterners have a different sense of time.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,4,Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,5,"Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest..."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,6,Welcome to the Iron Bank.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,7,"Please, sit."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,8,"What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,9,"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,10,"King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,11,Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,12,"The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,13,"King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,14,Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,15,He shares no blood with me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,16,He is a bastard born of incest.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,17,- As was his brother before him. - Yes.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,18,We have heard this story.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,19,It's not a story. It's the truth.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,20,The king's grandfather tells a different story.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,21,A story about a jealous uncle
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,22,whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,23,cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,24,in blood and gold.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,25,Gold you loaned him.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,26,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,27,More than any man living.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,28,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,29,"and ""madman"" and ""blood right."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,30,"Here, our books are filled with numbers."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,31,We prefer the stories they tell.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,32,More plain.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,33,Less open to interpretation.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,34,How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,35,"4,000."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,36,And how many ships do you have?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,37,"- Uh... - The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,38,not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,39,- Thirty-two. - And how much wheat and barley
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,40,and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,41,"to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,42,None.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,43,You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,44,from our perspective.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,45,I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,46,But we thank you for paying us the honour of your visit.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,47,"- My lord. - I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,48,You would not be either here.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,49,"In Braavos,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,50,thieves are not rewarded with titles.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,51,I didn't do the thieving.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,52,That would be the pirates.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,53,I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,54,This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,55,I consider it an honest accounting.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,56,He's an honest man and he's your best chance
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,57,to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,58,Which is a lot. Wars are expensive.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,59,"- The war is over. - As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,60,Who's the real power in King's Landing?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,61,- Ser Davos... - Humour me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,62,- Tywin Lannister. - How old is Tywin Lannister?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,63,Sixty-seven.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,64,"And when he dies, who's in command?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,65,"A half-grown boy,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,66,the product of incest?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,67,"Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,68,"Jaime Lannister,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,69,a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,70,"When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,71,That is a problem for another time.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,72,I think it's a problem for now.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,73,There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,74,Stannis.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,75,He's got the birthright.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,76,He's in his prime.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,77,He's a tried and tested battle commander.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,78,"And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,79,The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,80,"The captain shouts to his first mate,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,81,"""Bring me my red shirt."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,82,The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,83,"And when the pirates try to board,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,84,the brave captain leads his men to victory.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,85,"A few days later, the lookout screams,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,86,"""Two pirate ships!"""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,87,The crew is shivering like scared mice.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,88,"But the courageous captain hollers,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,89,"""Bring me my red shirt!"""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,90,"After the battle, the first mate asks,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,91,"""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,92,"The captain replies,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,93,"""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,94,"The next morning the lookout screams,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,95,"""Ten pirate ships! We are surrounded!"""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,96,The crew goes silent.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,97,"They all look to their brave captain,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,98,waiting for his usual command.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,99,"Calm as ever, the captain bellows..."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,100,"""Bring me my brown pants!"""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,101,You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,102,Davos.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,103,I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,104,Only half rotted.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,105,"Join us, my friend."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,106,This is Lhara.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,107,- And this is... - I am Lhara.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,108,"She's an artist, this one, truly."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,109,"No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,110,We?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,111,"You, me. We."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,112,Once I thought this man loved me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,113,Now I know he despises me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,114,He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,115,You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,116,There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,117,I gave it to your wife.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,118,"You're not my friend, my friend."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,119,I'll see you at sunrise.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,120,"""I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,121,"""and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,122,"""On the first night of the full moon,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,123,"""I will hunt down every islander still on our lands"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,124,"""and flay them living,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,125,"""the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,126,"""In the box you'll find a special gift."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,127,"""Theon's favourite toy."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,128,"""He cried when I took it away from him."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,129,"""Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,130,"Signed, ""Ramsay Snow,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,131,"""natural born son of Roose Bolton,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,132,"""Lord of the Dreadfort"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,133,"""and Warden of the North."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,134,Yes!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,135,They skinned our countrymen
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,136,"and they mutilated my brother,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,137,your prince.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,138,Your prince!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,139,"Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,140,Yes!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,141,"As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,142,"the word ""ironborn"" means nothing."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,143,Go left.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,144,- Theon Greyjoy. -  I don't know...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,145,I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,146,He's not in the dungeons.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,147,- Last cage on the right. - Thank you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,148,This way!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,149,We're going home.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,150,No!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,151,"It's all right. It's me, Yara."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,152,You can't trick me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,153,Tell him you couldn't trick me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,154,"I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,155,Not Theon! Reek!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,156,- My name is Reek! - They're here.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,157,"- lf they catch us in here, we're trapped. - Help me with him."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,158,"No, you can't!"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,159,You're Theon Greyjoy.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,160,"No, I don't believe her! I know who I am!"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,161,I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,162,Good Reek! I've always been Reek!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,163,This is turning into a lovely evening.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,164,I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,165,Theon!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,166,Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,167,You've got bigger balls than he ever did.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,168,"But with those big balls of yours,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,169,how fast can you run?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,170,"- Make for the ship, now. - But your brother?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,171,My brother is dead.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,172,I have a treat for you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,173,A reward.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,174,Reward?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,175,"Yes, Reek."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,176,"Those creatures who came in the night,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,177,they wanted to take you away.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,178,And you didn't let them.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,179,You remained loyal.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,180,I didn't want them to take me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,181,I was so scared. I didn't want them...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,182,"Yes, Reek."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,183,It's a bath.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,184,For you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,185,Remove those rags.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,186,Now.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,187,"The britches, too, Reek. Take them off."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,188,"Do you love me, Reek?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,189,"Yes, of course, my lord."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,190,Good.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,191,Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,192,There's a castle.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,193,Some bad men hold this castle.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,194,I need your help to take this castle back.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,195,But how can...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,196,I need you to play a role.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,197,To pretend to be someone you're not.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,198,Pretend to be who?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,199,Theon Greyjoy.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,200,"You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,201,"the First of Her Name,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,202,"the Unburnt,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,203,"Queen of Meereen,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,204,"Queen of the Andals and the First Men,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,205,"Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,206,Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,207,"Don't be afraid, my friend."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,208,The Queen says you may approach and speak.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,209,He is a goatherd.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,210,He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,211,I thank him for his prayers.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,212,"It was your dragons, he says."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,213,They came this morning for his flock.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,214,"He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,215,Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,216,I cannot bring back his goats...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,217,...but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,218,Send the next one in.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,219,The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,220,The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,221,Queen Daenerys.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,222,Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,223,I thank you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,224,Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,225,Then it is my honour to receive you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,226,"My father,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,227,"one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,228,oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,229,This pyramid included.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,230,"For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honoured to meet him."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,231,"You have, Your Grace."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,232,You crucified him.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,233,I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,234,Your father crucified innocent children.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,235,My father spoke out against crucifying those children.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,236,"He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,237,Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,238,"I am sorry you no longer have a father,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,239,but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,240,You'd be wise to remember that.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,241,What's done is done.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,242,You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,243,A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,244,- And what traditions do you speak of? - Of funeral rite.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,245,Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,246,"My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,247,"carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,248,"Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,249,so that they might receive proper burials.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,250,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,251,They were rotting in the sun as well.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,252,Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,253,"Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,254,I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,255,Let me take his body down.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,256,Let me have him brought to the temple
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,257,and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,258,"Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,259,"Thank you, my queen."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,260,How many more?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,261,"There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,262,212?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,263,Send the next one in.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,264,"These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,265,I was up late last night.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,266,"So, does this mean I am a master of something now?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,267,"Coins, ships?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,268,Lord Tywin and I already determined that
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,269,I shall be the Master of Ships long before you...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,270,"Lord Tywin, it's a great honour to have been granted a seat on this council. I..."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,271,The trial begins this afternoon.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,272,We only have the morning for affairs of state.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,273,"So, shall we begin?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,274,"Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,275,A coward and a traitor.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,276,My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,277,"I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,278,Disgraceful.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,279,What would it take to make the common soldier
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,280,stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,281,Ten silver stags seems a generous bounty.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,282,Make it 100. What else?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,283,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,284,The Targaryen girl?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,285,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,286,She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,287,Conquered with what?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,288,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,289,"Some 8,000 strong."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,290,"She has a company of sellswords, the Second Sons."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,291,"She has two knights advising her,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,292,Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,293,And she has three dragons.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,294,Baby dragons.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,295,"Larger every year, Your Grace."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,296,Mormont is spying on her for us.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,297,No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,298,"As for Ser Barristan,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,299,it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,300,He's an old man.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,301,He wasn't fit to protect my son.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,302,Joffrey didn't die on his watch.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,303,Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,304,Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,305,A child with two seasoned warriors counselling her
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,306,"and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,307,Lord Varys is right.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,308,I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,309,They are very impressive on the battlefield.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,310,Less so in the bedroom.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,311,Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,312,Armies win them all the time.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,313,She must be dealt with.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,314,"How, my lord? By force?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,315,"Eventually, if it comes to that."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,316,Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,317,"Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,318,"Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,319,Prince Oberyn.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,320,Lord Varys.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,321,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,322,No one is under obligation to call me lord.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,323,And yet everyone does.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,324,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,325,Did you spend much time in Essos?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,326,Five years.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,327,May I ask why?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,328,'Tis a big and beautiful world.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,329,Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,330,and never get to see any of it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,331,I don't want to be most of us.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,332,Most of us aren't princes.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,333,You are from Essos.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,334,Where? Lys?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,335,I have an ear for accents.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,336,I've lost my accent entirely.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,337,I have an ear for that as well.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,338,Hmm.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,339,How did you get here?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,340,It's a long story.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,341,One you don't like telling people.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,342,People I trust.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,343,"My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,344,You should come to the brothel and meet her.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,345,"We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,346,"We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,347,You did like boys before?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,348,Really?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,349,Girls? Hmm.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,350,I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,351,Not at all.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,352,"But I was never interested in girls, either."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,353,- What then? - Nothing.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,354,Everybody is interested in something.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,355,Not me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,356,"When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,357,I am very glad to have no part in it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,358,"Besides, the absence of desire"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,359,leaves one free to pursue other things.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,360,Such as?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,361,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,362,Really?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,363,Father's orders.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,364,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,365,Kingslayer!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,366,"I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,367,"First of my Name,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,368,"King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,369,"and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,370,do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,371,"Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,372,will sit as judge in my stead.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,373,And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,374,and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,375,"And if found guilty,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,376,may the gods punish the accused.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,377,"Tyrion of the House Lannister,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,378,you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,379,Did you kill King Joffrey?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,380,No.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,381,"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,382,Not that I know of.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,383,"How would you say he died, then?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,384,Choked on his pigeon pie.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,385,So you would blame the bakers?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,386,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,387,The crown may call its first witness.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,388,"Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,389,the Imp rounded on him.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,390,He slapped the king across the face
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,391,and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,392,It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,393,"Right here in this throne room,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,394,he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,395,Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,396,"And when I spoke in the king's defence,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,397,he threatened to have me killed.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,398,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,399,- Silence. - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,400,while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,401,Silence!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,402,You will not speak unless called upon.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,403,"You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,404,"""Basilisk venom,"

S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,412,"I think you have made your point, Grand Maester."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,413,You have a lot of poison in your store.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,414,"Had, Prince Oberyn."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,415,My stores were plundered.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,416,By whom?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,417,"By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,418,"Grand Maester,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,419,you examined King Joffrey's corpse.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,420,Was it without question poison that killed him?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,421,Without question.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,422,"This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,423,"He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,424,away from the feast.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,425,She wore this necklace the day of the wedding.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,426,Residue of the most rare and terrible poison
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,427,was found inside.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,428,Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,429,It was. The strangler.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,430,A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,431,And used to strike down the most noble child
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,432,the gods ever put on this good earth.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,433,"CERSEl: ""I will hurt you for this."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,434,"""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,435,"""and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,436,"""and you will know the debt is paid."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,437,Your own brother said this to you?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,438,Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,439,I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,440,"As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,441,He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,442,"Tyrion said,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,443,"""And you will know the debt is paid."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,444,What debt?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,445,I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,446,I asked him to confine his salacious acts
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,447,to the brothel where such behaviour belongs.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,448,He wasn't pleased.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,449,"Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,450,Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,451,"I'm afraid I do, my lord."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,452,"He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,453,"""Monsters are dangerous"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,454,"""and just now kings are dying like flies."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,455,And he said this to you at a meeting of the Small Council?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,456,Yes.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,457,After we received word of Robb Stark's death.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,458,He didn't seem gladdened by the news.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,459,Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,460,had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,461,"You're excused, Lord Varys."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,462,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,463,One.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,464,You once said
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,465,"that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,466,"You said the histories would never mention me,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,467,but you would not forget.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,468,"Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,469,"Sadly, my lord,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,470,I never forget a thing.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,471,We will adjourn for now.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,472,Toll the bells in an hour's time.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,473,Clear the court!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,474,You'd condemn your own son to death?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,475,I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,476,This isn't a trial. It's a farce.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,477,Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,478,I know nothing of the sort.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,479,- You've always hated Tyrion. - He killed his king.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,480,As did I.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,481,Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,482,To bring him your head.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,483,I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,484,- It won't be murder. It'll be justice. - Justice?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,485,I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,486,"If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,487,"- He'll be executed. - No, he'll be punished accordingly."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,488,"Once you said, ""Family is what lives on."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,489,"""All that lives on."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,490,"You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,491,What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,492,"I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,493,I'm well aware.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,494,What happens to your name?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,495,Who carries the lion banner into future battles?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,496,Your nephews?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,497,Lancel Lannister?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,498,Others whose names I don't even remember?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,499,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,500,It survives through me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,501,I'll leave the Kingsguard.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,502,I'll take my place as your son and heir
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,503,if you let Tyrion live.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,504,Done.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,505,"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,506,Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,507,He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,508,"In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,509,and live out his days at the Wall.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,510,You'll remove your white cloak immediately.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,511,You will leave King's Landing
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,512,to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,513,You will marry a suitable woman
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,514,and father children named Lannister.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,515,And you'll never turn your back on your family again.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,516,You have my word.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,517,And you have mine.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,518,"Not going well, is it?"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,519,You're going to be found guilty.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,520,"- Oh, you think so? - And when you are,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,521,you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,522,Father's agreed to it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,523,He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,524,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,525,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,526,How do you know?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,527,Do you trust me?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,528,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,529,This will all be over soon.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,530,The crown may call its next witness.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,531,State your name.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,532,Shae.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,533,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,534,I swear it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,535,Do you know this man?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,536,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,537,How do you know him?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,538,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,539,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,540,What do you know of this?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,541,I know that he's guilty.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,542,He and Sansa planned it together.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,543,Silence!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,544,Continue.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,545,"She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,546,She blamed their deaths on the king.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,547,Tyrion was happy to help.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,548,He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,549,"He hated you, my lord."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,550,He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,551,to put in Joffrey's wine.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,552,How could you possibly know all this?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,553,Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,554,I wasn't just her maid.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,555,I was his whore.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,556,I beg your pardon?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,557,You said you were his...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,558,His whore.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,559,How did you come to be in his service?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,560,He stole me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,561,"I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,562,"But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,563,He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,564,"""You belong to me now,"" he said."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,565,"""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,566,Silence!
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,567,And did you?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,568,Did I what?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,569,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,570,I did everything he wanted.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,571,Whatever he told me to do to him.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,572,Whatever he felt like doing to me.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,573,I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,574,I let him put himself where he wanted.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,575,I was his property.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,576,I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,577,"He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,578,"I took his face in my hands and said,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,579,"""I am yours and you are mine."""
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,580,Shae.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,581,Please don't.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,582,I am a whore.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,583,Remember?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,584,That was before he married Sansa.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,585,"After that, all he wanted was her."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,586,But she wouldn't let him into her bed.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,587,So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,588,"Father,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,589,I wish to confess.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,590,I wish to confess.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,591,You wish to confess?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,592,I saved you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,593,I saved this city
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,594,and all your worthless lives.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,595,I should have let Stannis kill you all.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,596,Tyrion.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,597,Do you wish to confess?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,598,"Yes, Father."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,599,I'm guilty.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,600,Is that what you want to hear?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,601,You admit you poisoned the king?
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,602,"No, of that I'm innocent."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,603,I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,604,I am guilty of being a dwarf.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,605,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,606,"Oh, yes, I am."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,607,I've been on trial for that my entire life.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,608,- Have you nothing to say in your defence? - Nothing but this...
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,609,I did not do it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,610,"I did not kill Joffrey,"
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,611,but I wish that I had.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,612,Watching your vicious bastard die
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,613,"gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,614,I wish I was the monster you think I am.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,615,I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,616,I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,617,Ser Meryn.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,618,Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,619,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,620,And I know I'll get no justice here.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,621,So I will let the gods decide my fate.
S04E06,The Laws Of Gods And Men,622,I demand a trial by combat.
S04E07,Mockingbird,1,"I made a deal for you,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,2,to keep your ungrateful head on your neck a little while longer.
S04E07,Mockingbird,3,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,4,The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?
S04E07,Mockingbird,5,You threw your life away.
S04E07,Mockingbird,6,"It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,7,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one."
S04E07,Mockingbird,8,"I couldn't listen to her standing there, telling her lies."
S04E07,Mockingbird,9,I couldn't do it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,10,You fell in love with a whore.
S04E07,Mockingbird,11,Yes.
S04E07,Mockingbird,12,And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.
S04E07,Mockingbird,13,"That deal you made,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,14,it was everything Father wanted.
S04E07,Mockingbird,15,You do see that? He gets you back as his heir.
S04E07,Mockingbird,16,The future Lord of the Rock.
S04E07,Mockingbird,17,"And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last."
S04E07,Mockingbird,18,All so perfect.
S04E07,Mockingbird,19,It felt good to take that from him.
S04E07,Mockingbird,20,He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.
S04E07,Mockingbird,21,He's willing to sacrifice any of us.
S04E07,Mockingbird,22,Not you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,23,You're the golden son.
S04E07,Mockingbird,24,"You could kill a king, lose a hand,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,25,"fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
S04E07,Mockingbird,26,Careful.
S04E07,Mockingbird,27,I'm the last friend you've got.
S04E07,Mockingbird,28,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
S04E07,Mockingbird,29,"Yes, brilliant speech."
S04E07,Mockingbird,30,They'll be talking about it for days to come.
S04E07,Mockingbird,31,I thought you were a realist.
S04E07,Mockingbird,32,Didn't realise you'd die for pride.
S04E07,Mockingbird,33,Don't give up on me just yet.
S04E07,Mockingbird,34,"I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
S04E07,Mockingbird,35,I can't save you this time either.
S04E07,Mockingbird,36,My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
S04E07,Mockingbird,37,Where's your sense of adventure?
S04E07,Mockingbird,38,"Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
S04E07,Mockingbird,39,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
S04E07,Mockingbird,40,It is tempting.
S04E07,Mockingbird,41,Well...
S04E07,Mockingbird,42,"Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again."
S04E07,Mockingbird,43,"If he wins,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,44,I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.
S04E07,Mockingbird,45,If he wins.
S04E07,Mockingbird,46,Will you find him for me?
S04E07,Mockingbird,47,Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion?
S04E07,Mockingbird,48,I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.
S04E07,Mockingbird,49,I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
S04E07,Mockingbird,50,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,51,Not Ser Meryn.
S04E07,Mockingbird,52,"Go on, move it."
S04E07,Mockingbird,53,And you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,54,Come on.
S04E07,Mockingbird,55,Mercy.
S04E07,Mockingbird,56,Please.
S04E07,Mockingbird,57,"Please, mercy."
S04E07,Mockingbird,58,CERSEl: Ser Gregor.
S04E07,Mockingbird,59,Welcome to the capital.
S04E07,Mockingbird,60,Thank you for riding here so quickly.
S04E07,Mockingbird,61,You seem to be in good form.
S04E07,Mockingbird,62,Who am I fighting?
S04E07,Mockingbird,63,Does it matter?
S04E07,Mockingbird,64,Could be food.
S04E07,Mockingbird,65,Could be soldiers.
S04E07,Mockingbird,66,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
S04E07,Mockingbird,67,Where else to sit?
S04E07,Mockingbird,68,"Tried to walk back to me hut,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,69,hurt too much.
S04E07,Mockingbird,70,Then I remembered they burned me hut down.
S04E07,Mockingbird,71,"Who were ""they""?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,72,I stopped asking a while ago.
S04E07,Mockingbird,73,That's not going to get better.
S04E07,Mockingbird,74,Doesn't seem so.
S04E07,Mockingbird,75,A bad way to go.
S04E07,Mockingbird,76,Haven't you had enough?
S04E07,Mockingbird,77,Of what?
S04E07,Mockingbird,78,I know.
S04E07,Mockingbird,79,Time to go.
S04E07,Mockingbird,80,Take matters into me own hands.
S04E07,Mockingbird,81,The thought has occurred to me.
S04E07,Mockingbird,82,So why go on?
S04E07,Mockingbird,83,Habit.
S04E07,Mockingbird,84,Nothing could be worse than this.
S04E07,Mockingbird,85,Maybe nothing is worse than this.
S04E07,Mockingbird,86,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything.
S04E07,Mockingbird,87,Nothing is just nothing.
S04E07,Mockingbird,88,Who are you?
S04E07,Mockingbird,89,My name is Arya.
S04E07,Mockingbird,90,Arya Stark.
S04E07,Mockingbird,91,You her father?
S04E07,Mockingbird,92,Her captor.
S04E07,Mockingbird,93,Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
S04E07,Mockingbird,94,"A fair exchange, that is."
S04E07,Mockingbird,95,Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings.
S04E07,Mockingbird,96,"You give me, I give you."
S04E07,Mockingbird,97,Fair.
S04E07,Mockingbird,98,A balance.
S04E07,Mockingbird,99,No balance any more.
S04E07,Mockingbird,100,Could I have a drink?
S04E07,Mockingbird,101,Dying is thirsty work.
S04E07,Mockingbird,102,Wish it were wine.
S04E07,Mockingbird,103,So do I.
S04E07,Mockingbird,104,That's where the heart is.
S04E07,Mockingbird,105,That's how you kill a man.
S04E07,Mockingbird,106,The fuck you doing?
S04E07,Mockingbird,107,There's a price on your head.
S04E07,Mockingbird,108,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
S04E07,Mockingbird,109,The king's dead.
S04E07,Mockingbird,110,He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.
S04E07,Mockingbird,111,The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.
S04E07,Mockingbird,112,A hundred silver stags.
S04E07,Mockingbird,113,And you thought you were going to collect it?
S04E07,Mockingbird,114,"Didn't think very hard, did you?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,115,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.
S04E07,Mockingbird,116,He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
S04E07,Mockingbird,117,This day's really not working out the way you planned.
S04E07,Mockingbird,118,He on your little list?
S04E07,Mockingbird,119,He can't be.
S04E07,Mockingbird,120,I don't know his name.
S04E07,Mockingbird,121,What's your name?
S04E07,Mockingbird,122,- Rorge. - Thank you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,123,You're learning.
S04E07,Mockingbird,124,Rangers returning!
S04E07,Mockingbird,125,They return!
S04E07,Mockingbird,126,- Rangers returning! - Greetings.
S04E07,Mockingbird,127,Didn't think I'd see you again.
S04E07,Mockingbird,128,"All right, Jon?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,129,"Welcome back, brother."
S04E07,Mockingbird,130,Lord Snow.
S04E07,Mockingbird,131,"This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,132,or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
S04E07,Mockingbird,133,"Come on, Ghost."
S04E07,Mockingbird,134,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left.
S04E07,Mockingbird,135,We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.
S04E07,Mockingbird,136,They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
S04E07,Mockingbird,137,I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello.
S04E07,Mockingbird,138,"The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,139,We need to prepare.
S04E07,Mockingbird,140,We've been preparing.
S04E07,Mockingbird,141,We should seal the tunnel.
S04E07,Mockingbird,142,Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
S04E07,Mockingbird,143,And how would we range north?
S04E07,Mockingbird,144,- We wouldn't. - Coward!
S04E07,Mockingbird,145,"You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,146,leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
S04E07,Mockingbird,147,"We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men."
S04E07,Mockingbird,148,This castle has stood for thousands of years.
S04E07,Mockingbird,149,The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years.
S04E07,Mockingbird,150,"And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
S04E07,Mockingbird,151,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,152,I have.
S04E07,Mockingbird,153,The tunnel's gate won't stop them.
S04E07,Mockingbird,154,The bars on those gates are four inches thick.
S04E07,Mockingbird,155,Cold-rolled steel.
S04E07,Mockingbird,156,And they won't stop them.
S04E07,Mockingbird,157,"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
S04E07,Mockingbird,158,The stewards.
S04E07,Mockingbird,159,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
S04E07,Mockingbird,160,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,161,Who would that be?
S04E07,Mockingbird,162,"- The builders. - Ah, the builders."
S04E07,Mockingbird,163,"First Builder Yarwyck,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,164,"Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,165,leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.
S04E07,Mockingbird,166,Do you agree with him?
S04E07,Mockingbird,167,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,168,"Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,169,you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.
S04E07,Mockingbird,170,Moving on.
S04E07,Mockingbird,171,"First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the Wall."
S04E07,Mockingbird,172,Aye.
S04E07,Mockingbird,173,My lord.
S04E07,Mockingbird,174,You have new clothes.
S04E07,Mockingbird,175,Do you like 'em? Eh?
S04E07,Mockingbird,176,Gloves are doeskin.
S04E07,Mockingbird,177,Softer than a virgin's thighs.
S04E07,Mockingbird,178,I sent for you days ago.
S04E07,Mockingbird,179,- I've been a bit busy. - Doing what?
S04E07,Mockingbird,180,My Ionesome bachelor days are over.
S04E07,Mockingbird,181,I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
S04E07,Mockingbird,182,Lollys Stokeworth?
S04E07,Mockingbird,183,She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
S04E07,Mockingbird,184,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
S04E07,Mockingbird,185,She's dim-witted.
S04E07,Mockingbird,186,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
S04E07,Mockingbird,187,"When my sister arranged this love match,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,188,did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
S04E07,Mockingbird,189,Falyse.
S04E07,Mockingbird,190,"Aye, I did know."
S04E07,Mockingbird,191,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
S04E07,Mockingbird,192,Falyse is 40 and barren.
S04E07,Mockingbird,193,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
S04E07,Mockingbird,194,She does.
S04E07,Mockingbird,195,Unless she happens to perish before her father.
S04E07,Mockingbird,196,Then Lollys gets the castle.
S04E07,Mockingbird,197,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
S04E07,Mockingbird,198,You and my sister deserve each other.
S04E07,Mockingbird,199,Why did you bother to come here?
S04E07,Mockingbird,200,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
S04E07,Mockingbird,201,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
S04E07,Mockingbird,202,One of each will do.
S04E07,Mockingbird,203,"But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,204,it'd better be a damn big castle.
S04E07,Mockingbird,205,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
S04E07,Mockingbird,206,I have gold.
S04E07,Mockingbird,207,What can I buy with gratitude?
S04E07,Mockingbird,208,You might be surprised.
S04E07,Mockingbird,209,A Lannister always pays his debts.
S04E07,Mockingbird,210,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
S04E07,Mockingbird,211,My wife is heir to Winterfell.
S04E07,Mockingbird,212,"If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,213,I may one day rule the North in her name.
S04E07,Mockingbird,214,I could carve you out a big piece of it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,215,If and may and could.
S04E07,Mockingbird,216,It's bloody cold up north.
S04E07,Mockingbird,217,Lollys is soft and warm. And close.
S04E07,Mockingbird,218,"If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,219,you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.
S04E07,Mockingbird,220,Does he frighten you so much?
S04E07,Mockingbird,221,I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.
S04E07,Mockingbird,222,He's freakish big and strong.
S04E07,Mockingbird,223,And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size.
S04E07,Mockingbird,224,"Maybe I could take him,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,225,"dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,226,"he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow."
S04E07,Mockingbird,227,But one misstep
S04E07,Mockingbird,228,and I'm dead.
S04E07,Mockingbird,229,Why should I risk it?
S04E07,Mockingbird,230,Because you're my friend.
S04E07,Mockingbird,231,"Aye, I'm your friend."
S04E07,Mockingbird,232,And when have you ever risked your life for me?
S04E07,Mockingbird,233,"I like you,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,234,pampered little shit that you are.
S04E07,Mockingbird,235,I just like myself more.
S04E07,Mockingbird,236,I understand.
S04E07,Mockingbird,237,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
S04E07,Mockingbird,238,Why are you sorry?
S04E07,Mockingbird,239,Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart?
S04E07,Mockingbird,240,That's what I liked about you in the first place.
S04E07,Mockingbird,241,We had some good days together.
S04E07,Mockingbird,242,"Yes, we did."
S04E07,Mockingbird,243,What will you do?
S04E07,Mockingbird,244,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.
S04E07,Mockingbird,245,Won't that make for a great song?
S04E07,Mockingbird,246,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
S04E07,Mockingbird,247,How did you get in here?
S04E07,Mockingbird,248,"Your door is well guarded,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,249,but your window is not.
S04E07,Mockingbird,250,I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
S04E07,Mockingbird,251,Don't do that again.
S04E07,Mockingbird,252,Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
S04E07,Mockingbird,253,These are my private quarters.
S04E07,Mockingbird,254,"If I want you here, I will summon you."
S04E07,Mockingbird,255,"Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
S04E07,Mockingbird,256,Tell me why you're here.
S04E07,Mockingbird,257,I came to ask a favour.
S04E07,Mockingbird,258,I only have two talents in this world.
S04E07,Mockingbird,259,War and women.
S04E07,Mockingbird,260,You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,261,"But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
S04E07,Mockingbird,262,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killings.
S04E07,Mockingbird,263,You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
S04E07,Mockingbird,264,"And as for women,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,265,there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.
S04E07,Mockingbird,266,"There is only one,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,267,and she does not want me.
S04E07,Mockingbird,268,You swore me your sword.
S04E07,Mockingbird,269,My sword is yours till the day I die.
S04E07,Mockingbird,270,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
S04E07,Mockingbird,271,I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.
S04E07,Mockingbird,272,Send me to kill your enemies.
S04E07,Mockingbird,273,Any enemy anywhere.
S04E07,Mockingbird,274,Let me do what I do best.
S04E07,Mockingbird,275,Very well.
S04E07,Mockingbird,276,Do what you do best.
S04E07,Mockingbird,277,Take off your clothes.
S04E07,Mockingbird,278,Oh.
S04E07,Mockingbird,279,"Come in, my queen. Please."
S04E07,Mockingbird,280,"I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
S04E07,Mockingbird,281,You could never.
S04E07,Mockingbird,282,I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
S04E07,Mockingbird,283,Could you bring me that vial over there?
S04E07,Mockingbird,284,The blue one.
S04E07,Mockingbird,285,"No, not that one."
S04E07,Mockingbird,286,You don't even want to touch that one.
S04E07,Mockingbird,287,Next to it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,288,That's the one.
S04E07,Mockingbird,289,"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me."
S04E07,Mockingbird,290,"He said,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,291,"""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while."
S04E07,Mockingbird,292,"""Make it count."""
S04E07,Mockingbird,293,A joke.
S04E07,Mockingbird,294,"Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
S04E07,Mockingbird,295,It was. I...
S04E07,Mockingbird,296,Humour isn't my strength.
S04E07,Mockingbird,297,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
S04E07,Mockingbird,298,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,299,Not always.
S04E07,Mockingbird,300,Most of these powders and potions
S04E07,Mockingbird,301,are lies.
S04E07,Mockingbird,302,Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power.
S04E07,Mockingbird,303,"Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,304,a trick that led them to the truth.
S04E07,Mockingbird,305,A pinch of this powder in a bonfire
S04E07,Mockingbird,306,will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.
S04E07,Mockingbird,307,And this one creates a black smoke
S04E07,Mockingbird,308,that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.
S04E07,Mockingbird,309,And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.
S04E07,Mockingbird,310,Did you use it with Stannis?
S04E07,Mockingbird,311,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,312,Don't be upset.
S04E07,Mockingbird,313,Men never crave what they already have.
S04E07,Mockingbird,314,It's only flesh.
S04E07,Mockingbird,315,It needs what it needs.
S04E07,Mockingbird,316,No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin.
S04E07,Mockingbird,317,I thank God every day for bringing you to us.
S04E07,Mockingbird,318,And Stannis to you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,319,He wants to bring Shireen with us.
S04E07,Mockingbird,320,I think that would be ill-advised.
S04E07,Mockingbird,321,"My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware."
S04E07,Mockingbird,322,"I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,323,"but whichever the case, she should stay home."
S04E07,Mockingbird,324,I understand how you feel.
S04E07,Mockingbird,325,But that is impossible.
S04E07,Mockingbird,326,Why?
S04E07,Mockingbird,327,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen."
S04E07,Mockingbird,328,You don't need lies.
S04E07,Mockingbird,329,You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.
S04E07,Mockingbird,330,However harsh it is.
S04E07,Mockingbird,331,However hard for us to understand.
S04E07,Mockingbird,332,"You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon."
S04E07,Mockingbird,333,"When we set sail, your daughter must be with us."
S04E07,Mockingbird,334,The Lord needs her.
S04E07,Mockingbird,335,Jorah the Andal.
S04E07,Mockingbird,336,Are you here to see our queen?
S04E07,Mockingbird,337,She's in a good mood.
S04E07,Mockingbird,338,Khaleesi.
S04E07,Mockingbird,339,- You're here early. - Later than some.
S04E07,Mockingbird,340,"- You don't approve? - It's not a question of approval,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,341,it's a question of trust.
S04E07,Mockingbird,342,You neither approve nor trust.
S04E07,Mockingbird,343,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
S04E07,Mockingbird,344,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
S04E07,Mockingbird,345,I did.
S04E07,Mockingbird,346,I trust you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,347,Daario Naharis killed his captains
S04E07,Mockingbird,348,and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.
S04E07,Mockingbird,349,How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
S04E07,Mockingbird,350,I could never have faith in a man like Daario.
S04E07,Mockingbird,351,That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
S04E07,Mockingbird,352,- You have? - I have.
S04E07,Mockingbird,353,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,354,"I fear the masters will simply bide their time,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,355,wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.
S04E07,Mockingbird,356,That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.
S04E07,Mockingbird,357,The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms.
S04E07,Mockingbird,358,They mutilate little boys by the thousands.
S04E07,Mockingbird,359,They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.
S04E07,Mockingbird,360,"They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
S04E07,Mockingbird,361,Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands
S04E07,Mockingbird,362,is also treating men like beasts.
S04E07,Mockingbird,363,"The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known."
S04E07,Mockingbird,364,"If you want them to know something else,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,365,you'll have to show it to them.
S04E07,Mockingbird,366,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
S04E07,Mockingbird,367,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,368,but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
S04E07,Mockingbird,369,Let the priests argue over good and evil.
S04E07,Mockingbird,370,Slavery is real.
S04E07,Mockingbird,371,"I can end it. I will end it,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,372,and those behind it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,373,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
S04E07,Mockingbird,374,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
S04E07,Mockingbird,375,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me
S04E07,Mockingbird,376,what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
S04E07,Mockingbird,377,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
S04E07,Mockingbird,378,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
S04E07,Mockingbird,379,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.
S04E07,Mockingbird,380,He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.
S04E07,Mockingbird,381,He will explain the choice they have before them.
S04E07,Mockingbird,382,They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
S04E07,Mockingbird,383,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves."
S04E07,Mockingbird,384,Tell him I changed my mind.
S04E07,Mockingbird,385,"Yes, Khaleesi."
S04E07,Mockingbird,386,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,387,Tell him you changed my mind.
S04E07,Mockingbird,388,Rat cunts.
S04E07,Mockingbird,389,Fucking whore.
S04E07,Mockingbird,390,You're doing it wrong.
S04E07,Mockingbird,391,You need to burn away that horrible bit there.
S04E07,Mockingbird,392,Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.
S04E07,Mockingbird,393,"I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right..."
S04E07,Mockingbird,394,No fire.
S04E07,Mockingbird,395,It'll only take a second.
S04E07,Mockingbird,396,- It won't hurt that much. - No fire!
S04E07,Mockingbird,397,Shut up about it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,398,About everything.
S04E07,Mockingbird,399,"Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway."
S04E07,Mockingbird,400,Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.
S04E07,Mockingbird,401,"I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,402,getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.
S04E07,Mockingbird,403,No reward is worth this much trouble.
S04E07,Mockingbird,404,Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,405,You say your brother gave you that sword.
S04E07,Mockingbird,406,My brother gave me this.
S04E07,Mockingbird,407,It was just like you said a while back.
S04E07,Mockingbird,408,Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
S04E07,Mockingbird,409,Why?
S04E07,Mockingbird,410,Thought I stole one of his toys.
S04E07,Mockingbird,411,I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,412,The pain was bad.
S04E07,Mockingbird,413,The smell was worse.
S04E07,Mockingbird,414,But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.
S04E07,Mockingbird,415,"My father, who protected him,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,416,told everyone my bedding caught fire.
S04E07,Mockingbird,417,You think you're on your own?
S04E07,Mockingbird,418,Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
S04E07,Mockingbird,419,Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.
S04E07,Mockingbird,420,We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.
S04E07,Mockingbird,421,I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night
S04E07,Mockingbird,422,and a hot meal not cooked by you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,423,"Couldn't agree more, my lady."
S04E07,Mockingbird,424,Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.
S04E07,Mockingbird,425,"- Not working for your former lord any longer. - Yes, my lady."
S04E07,Mockingbird,426,Don't get drunk.
S04E07,Mockingbird,427,"No, my lady."
S04E07,Mockingbird,428,Can I get you anything else?
S04E07,Mockingbird,429,"No, this will do nicely, thank you."
S04E07,Mockingbird,430,Kidney pie is wonderful.
S04E07,Mockingbird,431,Thanks.
S04E07,Mockingbird,432,I do my best.
S04E07,Mockingbird,433,A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.
S04E07,Mockingbird,434,"Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk."
S04E07,Mockingbird,435,"Easy enough. But the meat,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,436,"peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak"
S04E07,Mockingbird,437,and calves' kidneys is not easy.
S04E07,Mockingbird,438,"I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys."
S04E07,Mockingbird,439,"Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy."
S04E07,Mockingbird,440,Don't get me started on the gravy.
S04E07,Mockingbird,441,Very difficult to get right.
S04E07,Mockingbird,442,"See, a lot of people give up on the gravy."
S04E07,Mockingbird,443,You cannot give up.
S04E07,Mockingbird,444,"No gravy, no pie."
S04E07,Mockingbird,445,Simple as that.
S04E07,Mockingbird,446,That's nice armour. Are you a knight?
S04E07,Mockingbird,447,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,448,"Oh, it's just people with armour are usually knights."
S04E07,Mockingbird,449,"Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,450,From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred.
S04E07,Mockingbird,451,What brings you to these parts?
S04E07,Mockingbird,452,We're looking for someone.
S04E07,Mockingbird,453,Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here.
S04E07,Mockingbird,454,A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17...
S04E07,Mockingbird,455,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty."
S04E07,Mockingbird,456,"Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
S04E07,Mockingbird,457,Starks?
S04E07,Mockingbird,458,"What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,459,"No, ain't seen anyone like that."
S04E07,Mockingbird,460,I heard they was all traitors.
S04E07,Mockingbird,461,Don't need no traitors in here.
S04E07,Mockingbird,462,I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.
S04E07,Mockingbird,463,I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
S04E07,Mockingbird,464,Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
S04E07,Mockingbird,465,"- What? - It's nothing, my lady."
S04E07,Mockingbird,466,You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
S04E07,Mockingbird,467,"Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
S04E07,Mockingbird,468,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
S04E07,Mockingbird,469,The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.
S04E07,Mockingbird,470,The Lannisters have money.
S04E07,Mockingbird,471,People kill for money.
S04E07,Mockingbird,472,I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
S04E07,Mockingbird,473,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
S04E07,Mockingbird,474,- What about? Not kidney pie. - You seem like a proper lady.
S04E07,Mockingbird,475,Someone who could be trusted.
S04E07,Mockingbird,476,I never met no Sansa Stark.
S04E07,Mockingbird,477,But I know her sister.
S04E07,Mockingbird,478,Arya.
S04E07,Mockingbird,479,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.
S04E07,Mockingbird,480,She's presumed dead.
S04E07,Mockingbird,481,She weren't when I last spoke to her.
S04E07,Mockingbird,482,- When was that? - Heading up north with the Night's Watch.
S04E07,Mockingbird,483,She was all dressed up as a boy.
S04E07,Mockingbird,484,"Like your ladyship, only without the armour."
S04E07,Mockingbird,485,Going by the name Arry.
S04E07,Mockingbird,486,- So what happened to her? - Well...
S04E07,Mockingbird,487,The quick version.
S04E07,Mockingbird,488,The Lannisters took us prisoner.
S04E07,Mockingbird,489,We escaped.
S04E07,Mockingbird,490,The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep.
S04E07,Mockingbird,491,They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.
S04E07,Mockingbird,492,Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.
S04E07,Mockingbird,493,- Not friendly. - The Hound.
S04E07,Mockingbird,494,That's the one.
S04E07,Mockingbird,495,"If you find her, could you give her this?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,496,"She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
S04E07,Mockingbird,497,Um...
S04E07,Mockingbird,498,You were saying?
S04E07,Mockingbird,499,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,500,Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.
S04E07,Mockingbird,501,The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.
S04E07,Mockingbird,502,"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
S04E07,Mockingbird,503,Why the Eyrie?
S04E07,Mockingbird,504,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn."
S04E07,Mockingbird,505,Catelyn Stark's sister.
S04E07,Mockingbird,506,She's Arya's last living relative with money.
S04E07,Mockingbird,507,She hates the Lannisters.
S04E07,Mockingbird,508,Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which
S04E07,Mockingbird,509,and who hated who.
S04E07,Mockingbird,510,"Sansa could be there, too."
S04E07,Mockingbird,511,Could be.
S04E07,Mockingbird,512,You sure about this?
S04E07,Mockingbird,513,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,514,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
S04E07,Mockingbird,515,I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
S04E07,Mockingbird,516,Mmm. Do tell.
S04E07,Mockingbird,517,I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.
S04E07,Mockingbird,518,Your sister.
S04E07,Mockingbird,519,Oh.
S04E07,Mockingbird,520,Cersei approached me.
S04E07,Mockingbird,521,We spoke a great deal about her daughter.
S04E07,Mockingbird,522,How worried your sister is about her.
S04E07,Mockingbird,523,She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,524,I think she may have even believed it herself.
S04E07,Mockingbird,525,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
S04E07,Mockingbird,526,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.
S04E07,Mockingbird,527,It is rare to meet a Lannister
S04E07,Mockingbird,528,who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.
S04E07,Mockingbird,529,She desperately wants to see you killed.
S04E07,Mockingbird,530,She didn't need to bother you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,531,It looks as though I've taken care of that myself.
S04E07,Mockingbird,532,The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck.
S04E07,Mockingbird,533,She's wanted this for a long time.
S04E07,Mockingbird,534,"Yes, I know."
S04E07,Mockingbird,535,"We met, you and I."
S04E07,Mockingbird,536,Many years ago.
S04E07,Mockingbird,537,I think I would have remembered that.
S04E07,Mockingbird,538,Unlikely. You had just been born.
S04E07,Mockingbird,539,Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.
S04E07,Mockingbird,540,My first time away from Dorne.
S04E07,Mockingbird,541,I didn't like anything about the Rock.
S04E07,Mockingbird,542,"Not the food, not the weather, not your accents."
S04E07,Mockingbird,543,Nothing.
S04E07,Mockingbird,544,"But the biggest disappointment,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,545,you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,546,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
S04E07,Mockingbird,547,The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was
S04E07,Mockingbird,548,the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister.
S04E07,Mockingbird,549,"A head twice the size of his body,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,550,"a tail between his legs,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,551,"claws, one red eye,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,552,the privates of both a girl and a boy.
S04E07,Mockingbird,553,That would have made things so much easier.
S04E07,Mockingbird,554,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us."
S04E07,Mockingbird,555,"Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."""
S04E07,Mockingbird,556,Then she and your brother
S04E07,Mockingbird,557,took us to your nursery and...
S04E07,Mockingbird,558,...she unveiled the freak.
S04E07,Mockingbird,559,"Your head was a bit large, your arms and legs were a bit small,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,560,but no claw.
S04E07,Mockingbird,561,No red eye. No tail between your legs.
S04E07,Mockingbird,562,Just a tiny pink cock.
S04E07,Mockingbird,563,"We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei."
S04E07,Mockingbird,564,"""That's just a baby."""
S04E07,Mockingbird,565,"And she said, ""He killed my mother."""
S04E07,Mockingbird,566,"And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off."
S04E07,Mockingbird,567,Until your brother made her stop.
S04E07,Mockingbird,568,"""It doesn't matter,"" she told us."
S04E07,Mockingbird,569,"""Everyone says he will die soon."
S04E07,Mockingbird,570,"""I hope they are right."
S04E07,Mockingbird,571,"""He should not have lived this long."""
S04E07,Mockingbird,572,"Well,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,573,"sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
S04E07,Mockingbird,574,And what about what I want?
S04E07,Mockingbird,575,Justice
S04E07,Mockingbird,576,for my sister and her children.
S04E07,Mockingbird,577,"If you want justice,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,578,you've come to the wrong place.
S04E07,Mockingbird,579,I disagree.
S04E07,Mockingbird,580,I've come to the perfect place.
S04E07,Mockingbird,581,I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.
S04E07,Mockingbird,582,And all those who have wronged me are right here.
S04E07,Mockingbird,583,"I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,584,who killed my sister's children
S04E07,Mockingbird,585,and then raped her with their blood still on his hands
S04E07,Mockingbird,586,"before killing her, too."
S04E07,Mockingbird,587,I will be your champion.
S04E07,Mockingbird,588,"Hello, Robin."
S04E07,Mockingbird,589,What are you doing?
S04E07,Mockingbird,590,"I'm building my home, Winterfell."
S04E07,Mockingbird,591,At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.
S04E07,Mockingbird,592,Why did you leave?
S04E07,Mockingbird,593,It's a long story.
S04E07,Mockingbird,594,I stay here in the Eyrie.
S04E07,Mockingbird,595,Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe
S04E07,Mockingbird,596,because I'm the Lord of the Vale
S04E07,Mockingbird,597,and a very important person.
S04E07,Mockingbird,598,"Yes, you certainly are."
S04E07,Mockingbird,599,When will you go back?
S04E07,Mockingbird,600,Probably never.
S04E07,Mockingbird,601,My family doesn't live there any more and someone burned it down.
S04E07,Mockingbird,602,Oh.
S04E07,Mockingbird,603,Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
S04E07,Mockingbird,604,"No, I'm afraid not."
S04E07,Mockingbird,605,It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.
S04E07,Mockingbird,606,That sounds dangerous.
S04E07,Mockingbird,607,- How do you make people fly? - We don't.
S04E07,Mockingbird,608,What do you do with all the bad people
S04E07,Mockingbird,609,and the scary people and the people you don't like?
S04E07,Mockingbird,610,I never did anything with them at all.
S04E07,Mockingbird,611,Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
S04E07,Mockingbird,612,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale."
S04E07,Mockingbird,613,"When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me."
S04E07,Mockingbird,614,"Or you. When we get married,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,615,you can tell me if you don't like somebody
S04E07,Mockingbird,616,"and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh!"
S04E07,Mockingbird,617,Right through the Moon Door.
S04E07,Mockingbird,618,I like the sound of that.
S04E07,Mockingbird,619,Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
S04E07,Mockingbird,620,All right.
S04E07,Mockingbird,621,- It can go in here in this big tower. - Be careful.
S04E07,Mockingbird,622,You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
S04E07,Mockingbird,623,- I didn't ruin it. - You did.
S04E07,Mockingbird,624,It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door.
S04E07,Mockingbird,625,- I was fixing it. - Knocking things down isn't fixing them.
S04E07,Mockingbird,626,- It's ruining them. - I didn't ruin it!
S04E07,Mockingbird,627,- You're being stupid. - I didn't ruin it!
S04E07,Mockingbird,628,"Robin, I'm sorry, I..."
S04E07,Mockingbird,629,Children.
S04E07,Mockingbird,630,"- I hit him. - Yes, I saw."
S04E07,Mockingbird,631,- I shouldn't have done that. - No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,632,"His mother should have, a long time ago."
S04E07,Mockingbird,633,Consider it a step in the right direction.
S04E07,Mockingbird,634,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
S04E07,Mockingbird,635,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
S04E07,Mockingbird,636,I was trying to remember what everything looked like.
S04E07,Mockingbird,637,I'll never see it again.
S04E07,Mockingbird,638,A lot can happen between now and never.
S04E07,Mockingbird,639,"If you want to build a better home,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,640,first you must demolish the old one.
S04E07,Mockingbird,641,Why did you really kill Joffrey?
S04E07,Mockingbird,642,Tell me why.
S04E07,Mockingbird,643,I loved your mother more than you could ever know.
S04E07,Mockingbird,644,"Given the opportunity,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,645,what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love?
S04E07,Mockingbird,646,"In a better world,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,647,"one where love could overcome strength and duty,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,648,you might have been my child.
S04E07,Mockingbird,649,But we don't live in that world.
S04E07,Mockingbird,650,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
S04E07,Mockingbird,651,Lord Baelish...
S04E07,Mockingbird,652,Call me Petyr.
S04E07,Mockingbird,653,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
S04E07,Mockingbird,654,"Come here, Sansa."
S04E07,Mockingbird,655,Do you know how far the fall is?
S04E07,Mockingbird,656,No.
S04E07,Mockingbird,657,"Neither do I, precisely."
S04E07,Mockingbird,658,Hundreds of feet.
S04E07,Mockingbird,659,It's fascinating
S04E07,Mockingbird,660,what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height.
S04E07,Mockingbird,661,The impact breaks them right apart.
S04E07,Mockingbird,662,Like eggs dropped on the floor.
S04E07,Mockingbird,663,Sometimes pieces remain intact.
S04E07,Mockingbird,664,You'll find the head sitting on its own.
S04E07,Mockingbird,665,Every hair in place.
S04E07,Mockingbird,666,Blue eyes staring at nothing.
S04E07,Mockingbird,667,I know what you did.
S04E07,Mockingbird,668,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa."
S04E07,Mockingbird,669,I never should have hit Robin.
S04E07,Mockingbird,670,"- I promise it won't happen... - Don't be coy with me, you little whore."
S04E07,Mockingbird,671,You kissed Petyr.
S04E07,Mockingbird,672,- I didn't. You don't understand. - I saw you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,673,You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
S04E07,Mockingbird,674,- He kissed me. I pulled away. - Liar! Whore!
S04E07,Mockingbird,675,He is mine!
S04E07,Mockingbird,676,"My father, my husband, my sister,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,677,they all stood between us and now they're all dead.
S04E07,Mockingbird,678,That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me.
S04E07,Mockingbird,679,Look down!
S04E07,Mockingbird,680,- Look down! - Lysa!
S04E07,Mockingbird,681,Let her go.
S04E07,Mockingbird,682,You want her?
S04E07,Mockingbird,683,This empty-headed child?
S04E07,Mockingbird,684,Let her go.
S04E07,Mockingbird,685,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,686,I lied for you. I killed for you.
S04E07,Mockingbird,687,- Why did you bring her here? - I'll send her away.
S04E07,Mockingbird,688,I swear on my life.
S04E07,Mockingbird,689,I swear to all the gods.
S04E07,Mockingbird,690,"Let her go, Lysa."
S04E07,Mockingbird,691,"Oh, my sweet wife."
S04E07,Mockingbird,692,"My sweet, silly wife."
S04E07,Mockingbird,693,"I have only loved one woman,"
S04E07,Mockingbird,694,"only one, my entire life."
S04E07,Mockingbird,695,Your sister.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,1,Here we are.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,2,Ready?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,3,The Rains of Castamere.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,4,You fucking deaf?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,5,Same wrong guess every fucking time.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,6,"Listen, you cunt."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,7,Oh!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,8,The Bear and the Maiden Fair.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,9,- Yes! - There's a man with an ear.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,10,Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,11,"First time I saw you with your breeches down, I thought you were a eunuch."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,12,"You've seen it, girls."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,13,Like a baby snail peeking out of its shell.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,14,Your baby was crying this morning.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,15,Woke me up.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,16,- You hear me? - Yes.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,17,"Well, got anything to say?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,18,I'm sorry.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,19,I don't care if you're sorry.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,20,"Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,21,Don't you ever touch him.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,22,Little wildling bitch.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,23,You should have stayed with your own kind.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,24,- Are you listening to me? - Shut your mouth.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,25,What?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,26,"It's just an owl, you dumb bitch."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,27,"No, it's not."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,28,Shh.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,29,I should never have left her there.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,30,- You couldn't have known. - Of course I could've.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,31,They've been raiding the villages close by.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,32,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,33,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,34,"So it's all right, then?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,35,Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,36,I didn't say it was all right. I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,37,We're pledged to guard the realms of men.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,38,She's dead because of me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,39,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,40,We can't go after them. You know that.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,41,It's what they want.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,42,And little Sam.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,43,As if I cut their throats myself.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,44,Maybe she managed to hide herself.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,45,I thought all of you was dead.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,46,You went up north with Mormont and no one came back.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,47,Not for ages.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,48,But then you did.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,49,"She survived Craster, and he was the worst shit I've ever met."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,50,She survived the long march to the Wall.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,51,"She survived a White Walker, for fuck's sake."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,52,She might have got out.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,53,She might have.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,54,"If they hit Mole's Town,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,55,then we're next.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,56,Mance and his army must be close.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,57,"100,000 of them."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,58,"And there's what, 105 of us left?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,59,"You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,60,102.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,61,"How do 102 men stop 100,000?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,62,"Whoever dies last,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,63,be a good lad and burn the rest of us.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,64,"Once I'm done with this world,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,65,I don't want to come back.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,66,You think he was spying on you?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,67,"MISSANDEl: No, not spying."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,68,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,69,They make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,70,"Yes, Your Grace."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,71,But you are not Dothraki.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,72,No.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,73,"Well, I don't see why it matters."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,74,Grey Worm isn't interested.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,75,None of the Unsullied care what's under our clothes.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,76,He was interested.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,77,What?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,78,I believe he was interested.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,79,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,80,All of it?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,81,The pillar and the stones.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,82,"I don't know, Your Grace."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,83,Haven't you ever wondered?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,84,"Yes, Your Grace."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,85,Missandei.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,86,I have come to apologise.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,87,You don't need to apologise.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,88,I hope I didn't frighten you.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,89,No.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,90,"The lessons you give I in Common Tongue,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,91,these are precious to I.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,92,"- ""To me."" - To me."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,93,"I don't remember teaching you the word ""precious."""
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,94,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I..."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,95,He teaches me this word.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,96,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,97,I remember nothing.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,98,Only Unsullied.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,99,"When they cut you,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,100,do you remember that?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,101,I'm sorry.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,102,- I'm sorry they did that to you. - Why?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,103,Why sorry?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,104,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,105,"If the Masters never cut me,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,106,I never am Unsullied.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,107,I never stand in the Plaza of Pride
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,108,when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the Masters.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,109,I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,110,I never meet Missandei from the island of Naath.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,111,I am sorry I...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,112,"For today,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,113,I am sorry.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,114,Grey Worm.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,115,I'm glad you saw me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,116,So am I.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,117,Kraken.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,118,"Mmm. Strong, as long as they're in the sea."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,119,"When you take them out of the water, no bones."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,120,They collapse under their proud weight and slump into a heap of nothing.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,121,You'd think they'd know that.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,122,"Unfortunately, they're not very bright."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,123,What do you tell them?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,124,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,125,heir to the Iron Islands.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,126,- And what are you really? - I'm Reek.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,127,Are you sure?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,128,You do look very much like a lord.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,129,"Formidable, proud."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,130,I'm Reek.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,131,Until when?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,132,Always.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,133,- Forever. - That's right.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,134,Until you're rotting in the ground.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,135,Remember what you are and what you're not.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,136,Bring me Moat Cailin.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,137,No closer.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,138,Who are you?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,139,"I'm Kenning,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,140,commander of this garrison.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,141,And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,142,Yes.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,143,And why should I believe that?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,144,I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,145,His third and last living son.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,146,I am your prince.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,147,I swear it by the Drowned God.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,148,What is dead may never die.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,149,What is dead may never die.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,150,"And if you were my prince,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,151,why are you marching with a Bolton army?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,152,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,153,He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,154,And what does Lord Bolton want?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,155,"You are fading from sickness,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,156,"you are badly outnumbered, and you're hundreds of miles from the sea."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,157,Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,158,and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,159,"Do this, and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,160,The Boltons will give you safe passage to the Stony Shore.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,161,He wants us to surrender?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,162,"My own father, your king,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,163,surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,164,I watched him bend the knee.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,165,There was no shame there.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,166,"He fought with honour, as did you."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,167,"""No shame."" ""Fought with honour."""
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,168,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,169,"""No shame."" ""Fought with honour."""
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,170,Only a whipped dog would speak this way.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,171,Or a woman.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,172,"Are you a woman, boy?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,173,You don't know...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,174,The ironborn will not surrender.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,175,My name is Reek...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,176,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,177,or whoever the fuck you are.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,178,Reek.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,179,- What in the hell are you muttering? - Reek.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,180,Reek.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,181,"If we yield, we live?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,182,- Is that what it says on this paper here? - Yes.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,183,Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,184,You're going home.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,185,"You didn't really think I'd let them go, did you?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,186,"It's fallen out of fashion, flaying."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,187,"Sad, but true."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,188,Traditions are important.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,189,Where are we without our history? Eh?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,190,"Yes, my lord."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,191,Will we go home now?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,192,I believe we will.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,193,To our new home.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,194,"You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,195,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,196,I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,197,Our forebears settled the Vale thousands of years ago.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,198,We've fought off invaders ever since.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,199,The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,200,"Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,201,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,202,But I didn't need to hear from her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,203,Moneylender. Whoremonger.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,204,"You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,205,- it's a wonder your tongue's not black. - My lord...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,206,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,207,Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,208,"But when I heard you were lurking here,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,209,- fawning over the Lady Arryn... - Lady Arryn invited me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,210,She and I have been close since childhood.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,211,"Yes, we all know how close you were."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,212,Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,213,Her death is our affair.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,214,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,215,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,216,But suicide?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,217,She adored that boy of hers.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,218,I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,219,"Strange that within days of your arrival,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,220,you've married Lady Arryn
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,221,and she's fallen through the Moon Door.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,222,She was always prone to melancholy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,223,My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,224,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,225,"A niece of yours, I believe."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,226,A girl with no learning and scattered wits.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,227,"I assure you, she would be of no help."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,228,We'd like to speak with her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,229,- Let me fetch her. - No need.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,230,We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,231,"Come closer, child."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,232,You have nothing to fear from us or him.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,233,Lord Baelish here is your uncle?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,234,Your name is Alayne?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,235,Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,236,- My lady... - I wasn't asking you.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,237,He can stay.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,238,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,239,Tell us what you saw.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,240,"I'm sorry, Lord Baelish."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,241,I have to tell the truth.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,242,I'll tell you everything.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,243,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,244,My name is not Alayne.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,245,"It's Sansa Stark,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,246,eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,247,"Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,248,You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,249,Sansa Stark?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,250,"You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,251,Lord Baelish has told many lies.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,252,All to protect me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,253,"Since my father was executed,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,254,I have been a hostage in King's Landing.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,255,A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,256,"They beat me, they humiliated me,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,257,they married me to the Imp.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,258,"I had no friends in King's Landing,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,259,except one.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,260,He saved me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,261,Smuggled me away when he had the chance.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,262,"He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,263,But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,264,Even the Vale.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,265,He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,266,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,267,Your father grew up right here in these halls.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,268,We hunted together many times.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,269,He was a fine man.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,270,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,271,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,272,She was a troubled woman.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,273,She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,274,"From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,275,a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,276,She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,277,"She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,278,"When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,279,she was so happy. For a time.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,280,My aunt was a jealous lady.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,281,She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her any more.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,282,That he would abandon her for a younger woman.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,283,"And then,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,284,one day she saw him kiss me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,285,Lady Sansa.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,286,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,287,"Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,288,He's always been so kind to me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,289,"I was so happy to be here, to be free."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,290,All because of him.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,291,But my aunt turned on me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,292,She cursed me. Called me a whore.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,293,Promised to throw me through the Moon Door.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,294,"When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,295,She said she didn't want to live any more.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,296,She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,297,"He tried to reason with her,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,298,"promised her she was the only one he had ever loved,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,299,but she stepped through those doors and she was...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,300,"It's not your fault, sweet girl."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,301,It's not your fault.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,302,You could see it in the way she raised that boy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,303,Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,304,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,305,"Apologies, my lady."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,306,"And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,307,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,308,I want the same.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,309,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,310,"For Lysa, no. But for her son?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,311,"Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,312,"rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,313,They fought together to overcome the Mad King.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,314,"And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,315,all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,316,A timid boy at a tavern brawl.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,317,Are you questioning our courage?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,318,I want to know which side you're on.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,319,"Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,320,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,321,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support, and Lysa refused."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,322,"By staying out of the fray,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,323,you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,324,Who stands against him now?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,325,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,326,Robb Stark is dead.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,327,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,328,Lord of the Vale.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,329,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,330,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,331,More often they die young.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,332,"I adored Lysa with all my heart,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,333,but she loved her son so much she became overprotective.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,334,"He needs to learn how to swing a sword, how to ride a horse."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,335,"- Aye, it's time. - Yes."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,336,"Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,337,Time for Robin to leave the nest.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,338,Ser Barristan.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,339,Yes?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,340,Who sent you?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,341,- Ser Barristan. - Ser Jorah.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,342,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,343,No.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,344,What's this?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,345,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,346,You spied on her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,347,Who gave you this?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,348,Does it matter?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,349,"- Have you told her? - I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,350,rather than go behind your back.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,351,Let me speak with her in private.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,352,You'll never be alone with her again.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,353,Why did the usurper pardon you?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,354,If we could speak alone.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,355,"No, speak to me here."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,356,Explain it to me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,357,Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,358,This is the work of Tywin Lannister.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,359,He wants to divide us.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,360,"If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,361,The pardon was signed the year we met.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,362,Why were you pardoned?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,363,Unless you're saying this document was forged.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,364,It is not forged.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,365,"Why, then?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,366,"I sent letters to Varys,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,367,the spymaster of King's Landing.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,368,What was the content of these letters?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,369,- Information. - What information?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,370,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,371,His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,372,When you were married.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,373,When your brother died.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,374,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,375,- I... - Yes or no?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,376,- Khaleesi. - Don't call me that.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,377,Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,378,Yes.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,379,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,380,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,381,Because you knew it was poisoned.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,382,I suspected.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,383,You betrayed me
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,384,from the first.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,385,Forgive me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,386,I never meant...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,387,"Please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,388,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,389,"- and stole my brother's throne... - I have protected you,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,390,"- fought for you, killed for you. ...and you want me to forgive you?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,391,I have loved you.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,392,Love?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,393,Love? How can you say that to me?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,394,"Any other man, and I would have you executed."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,395,"But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,396,"Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon, if you can."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,397,"Daenerys, please."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,398,Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,399,You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,400,"If you're found in Meereen past break of day,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,401,I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,402,Go.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,403,Now.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,404,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,405,Walk with me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,406,Has there been any word from Locke?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,407,No.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,408,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,409,None of the northern lords have seen them.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,410,Dead most likely.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,411,Most of the ironborn have fled the North.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,412,"Now more will follow, thanks to you."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,413,Tell me what you see.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,414,"Moors, fields, hills."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,415,Tell me what you see.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,416,Nothing.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,417,Not nothing. The North.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,418,"Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,419,400 miles that way.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,420,300 miles that way.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,421,The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,422,And I am the Warden of the North.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,423,The North is mine.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,424,"Now tell me, what is your name?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,425,Ramsay Snow.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,426,"No, not Ramsay Snow."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,427,Open it.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,428,"From this day until your last day,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,429,"you are Ramsay Bolton,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,430,"son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,431,You honour me.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,432,I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,433,"I will be worthy of you, Father,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,434,I promise.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,435,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,436,Yes?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,437,"First time I saw you, you were just a child."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,438,A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,439,You're not a child any longer.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,440,Why did you help me?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,441,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,442,That's not an answer.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,443,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,444,I don't know.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,445,Neither do I.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,446,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,447,And you think you know me?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,448,- I know what you want. - Do you?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,449,"I thought it'd make me happy,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,450,but it doesn't. Not really.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,451,Nothing makes you happy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,452,- Lots of things make me happy. - Like what?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,453,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,454,"So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,455,is that it?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,456,At least I could have been there to watch.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,457,I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,458,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,459,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,460,I wasn't the damn wine-taster.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,461,"Little shit deserved to die, but poison..."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,462,Poison's a woman's weapon.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,463,Men kill with steel.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,464,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,465,I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,466,I'd pay good money to see that.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,467,You should have let me burn it.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,468,It's a fleabite.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,469,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,470,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,471,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,472,Aye.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,473,I've never even met her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,474,Doesn't matter. You're her blood.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,475,"Family, honour, all that horseshit."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,476,It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,477,I'm not a lady.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,478,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,479,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,480,And his
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,481,"travelling companion, Arya Stark,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,482,niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,483,Then I offer my condolences.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,484,Lady Arryn died.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,485,Three days ago.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,486,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,487,You shouldn't be.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,488,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,489,It's not safe outside.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,490,It wasn't safe for her inside.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,491,People die at their dinner tables.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,492,They die in their beds.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,493,They die squatting over their chamber pots.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,494,Everybody dies sooner or later.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,495,Don't worry about your death.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,496,Worry about your life.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,497,Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,498,That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,499,Shall we go?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,500,Wine always helps.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,501,I thank you for it.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,502,Trial by combat.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,503,Deciding a man's guilt or innocence
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,504,in the eyes of the gods
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,505,by having two other men hack each other to pieces.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,506,Tells you something about the gods.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,507,How much longer?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,508,Soon.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,509,Do you think Oberyn has a chance?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,510,The Red Viper of Dorne.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,511,"You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,512,I've never seen him fight.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,513,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,514,- Oberyn believes in himself. - That's putting it mildly.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,515,What's the punishment for regicide?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,516,Drawing and quartering? Hanging?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,517,- Breaking at the wheel? - Beheading.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,518,Seems rather ordinary.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,519,"And he was my nephew as well, so what is that?"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,520,Fratricide is brothers and filicide is sons.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,521,Nepoticide. That's the one.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,522,"Matricide, patricide,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,523,"infanticide, suicide."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,524,There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,525,- Cousins. - You're right.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,526,There is no word for cousin-killing.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,527,Well done.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,528,Do you remember Cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,529,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head and left him simple.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,530,Simple?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,531,Used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,532,- Nothing made him happier. - Nothing made you happier.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,533,You'd think being tormented from birth
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,534,would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,535,On the contrary.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,536,Laughing at another person's misery
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,537,was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,538,"- The joke wore thin, though. - For you. You drifted away."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,539,I had other interests.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,540,"Yes, other interests."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,541,- But I stayed with Orson. - Why?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,542,I was curious.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,543,Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,544,First thing I did was ask him.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,545,"""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"""
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,546,He gave me an answer.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,547,"""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em."""
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,548,I wasn't deterred.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,549,I was the smartest person I knew.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,550,Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,551,that lay at the heart of a moron.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,552,So I went to Maester Volarik's library.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,553,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,554,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,555,and not nearly enough about morons.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,556,Doesn't seem right.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,557,"In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,558,or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,559,So I went back to the source.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,560,"I may not have been able to speak with Orson,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,561,"but I could observe him, watch him"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,562,the way men watch animals
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,563,to come to a deeper understanding of their behaviour.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,564,"And as I watched,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,565,I became more and more sure of it.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,566,There was something happening there.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,567,His face was like the page of a book
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,568,written in a language I didn't understand.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,569,But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,570,And I became possessed with knowing what they were.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,571,I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,572,"I would eat my lunch in the garden,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,573,chewing my mutton to the music of...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,574,"And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,575,"Father droned on about the family legacy,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,576,and I thought about Orson's beetles.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,577,I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,578,Did I hear dragon wings? No.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,579,I heard...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,580,And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,581,"And I had to know, because it was horrible"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,582,that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,583,"Every day around the world,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,584,"men, women, and children are murdered by the score."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,585,Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,586,I know. But still it filled me with dread.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,587,"Piles and piles of them, years and years of them."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,588,"How many countless living, crawling things"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,589,smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,590,In my dreams I found myself
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,591,standing on a beach made of beetle husks
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,592,stretching as far as the eye could see.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,593,"I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,594,I tried to stop Orson once.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,595,He was twice your size.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,596,"He just pushed me aside with a ""cuhn"" and kept on smashing."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,597,"Every day,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,598,until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,599,So what do you think?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,600,Why did he do it?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,601,What was it all about?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,602,I don't know.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,603,Good luck today.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,604,Looks like very light armour.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,605,I like to move around.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,606,You could at least wear a helmet.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,607,You shouldn't drink before a fight.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,608,You learned this during your years in the fighting pits?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,609,I always drink before a fight.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,610,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,611,Today is not the day I die.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,612,You're going to fight that?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,613,I'm going to kill that.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,614,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,615,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,616,Thank the gods.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,617,"In the sight of gods and men,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,618,we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,619,"...man, Tyrion Lannister."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,620,May the Mother grant them mercy.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,621,May the Father give them such justice as they deserve.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,622,And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,623,Don't leave me alone in this world.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,624,Never.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,625,Have they told you who I am?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,626,Some dead man.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,627,I am the brother of Elia Martell.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,628,And do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,629,For you.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,630,I'm going to hear you confess before you die.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,631,You raped my sister. You murdered her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,632,You killed her children.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,633,"Say it now, and we can make this quick."
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,634,Say it. You raped her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,635,You murdered her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,636,You killed her children.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,637,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,638,You raped her!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,639,You murdered her!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,640,You killed her children!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,641,Wait. Are you dying?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,642,No. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,643,Say it.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,644,Say her name. Elia Martell.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,645,You raped her. You killed her children.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,646,Elia Martell.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,647,Who gave you the order?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,648,Who gave you the order?
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,649,Say her name!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,650,You raped her! You murdered her!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,651,You killed her children!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,652,Say her name.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,653,Say it!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,654,Elia Martell.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,655,"I killed her children,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,656,then I raped her.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,657,Then I smashed her head in like this!
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,658,The gods have made their will known.
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,659,"Tyrion Lannister,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,660,"in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,661,"First of His Name,"
S04E08,The Mountain And The Viper,662,you are hereby sentenced to death.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,1,What was she like?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,2,She had red hair.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,3,Oh?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,4,- How big were her feet? - What do you want me to say?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,5,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,6,To be with someone.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,7,To love someone and have them love you back.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,8,We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,9,You're the closest I'll ever get to knowing.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,10,So you and Gilly never?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,11,No. She just had a baby.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,12,And she never offered.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,13,"But if she had,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,14,you would have?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,15,You'd have broken your vows?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,16,"The interesting thing is,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,17,our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,18,What?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,19,"""I shall take no wife."" Yes, that's in there. There's no denying that."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,20,"""I shall father no children."" It's very specific."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,21,But what our vows have to say about other activities
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,22,is open to interpretation.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,23,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,24,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,25,We didn't.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,26,So what's it like?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,27,It's...
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,28,There's this whole other person.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,29,"And you're wrapped up in them, and they're wrapped up in you."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,30,And you...
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,31,"For a little while, you're more than just you. You're..."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,32,"Well, I don't know. I'm not a bleeding poet."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,33,"No, you're really not."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,34,What did I get for it?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,35,An arrow six inches from my heart.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,36,There'll be arrows for all of us soon.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,37,There will.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,38,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,39,"Go get some sleep, Sam."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,40,I'll take this watch.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,41,Did I ever tell you about her?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,42,Sheila?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,43,Yes.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,44,That was a night to remember.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,45,"Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,46,"Her fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,47,And she was nice and soft down below.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,48,"No, she was no ordinary beast."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,49,Many is the man who...
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,50,I know you never fucked a bear.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,51,You know you never fucked a bear.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,52,"Right now, I don't want to think about the bear you never fucked."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,53,"Right now, all I want to think about is"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,54,each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow's heart.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,55,We could be waiting here a while.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,56,Good.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,57,"The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,58,They came up here to our land
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,59,and put up a big wall and said it was theirs.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,60,Then they started hunting us down.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,61,"But this time, we're the ones doing the hunting."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,62,You've got a lot to say about killing.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,63,Even more words than arrows.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,64,"Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,65,"More, I reckon."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,66,"Yes, but none of those were your crow lover."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,67,I probably killed him already.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,68,So you've said.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,69,"And if not,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,70,the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around me neck.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,71,More words.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,72,Know what I think you do when you see him?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,73,Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,74,"What, you've been thinking about that ginger minge?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,75,Wondering what it tastes like?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,76,Maybe I have.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,77,Jon Snow is mine.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,78,"Anyone else tries to kill him,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,79,I'll have an arrow for them.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,80,And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,81,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,82,Maester Aemon.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,83,- How did you know... - That it was you?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,84,Who else but Samwell Tarly
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,85,would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,86,"- Let me help you. - Oh, no need."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,87,I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,88,Thousands of books and no eyes to read them.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,89,"Old age is a wonderful source of ironies,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,90,if nothing else.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,91,But you didn't answer my question.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,92,What are you reading?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,93,Maester Faull.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,94,Ah.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,95,The wildlings.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,96,I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,97,ever got to a wildling was this very library.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,98,"But what he says about what they do,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,99,it's all true.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,100,It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,101,"Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,102,Love is the death of duty.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,103,I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,104,"He didn't listen, and neither did you."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,105,Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,106,to come here and read about the terrible things
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,107,that may have happened to the girl you love.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,108,I don't love her.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,109,"- Yes, you do. - No."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,110,"Yes, you do."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,111,Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,112,I remember how it sounds.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,113,I was in love once.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,114,You were?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,115,You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,116,Is it so difficult to imagine that
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,117,"an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,118,"I'm sorry, Maester."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,119,I didn't mean it like that.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,120,Do you know who I was before I came here?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,121,What I could have been if I'd only said the word?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,122,Of course you do.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,123,I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,124,A future king always does.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,125,Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,126,One of them succeeded.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,127,I was very young.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,128,Who was she?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,129,Ah.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,130,I could tell you everything about her.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,131,"Who she was, how we met,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,132,the colour of her eyes and the shape of her nose.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,133,I can see her
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,134,right in front of me.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,135,She's more real than you are.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,136,We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,137,Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,138,than the prospect of imminent death.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,139,"Go to bed, Tarly."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,140,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. Orders."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,141,You don't understand. They killed everyone.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,142,Everyone but my baby.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,143,And they're out there. I saw them on my way here.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,144,They may have seen me. They may have followed me. Please.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,145,"I'm sorry, I can't."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,146,"If they find us out here, you don't know what they'll do."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,147,Pyp! Open the gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,148,"- I can't. - Sam, is that you?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,149,Yes.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,150,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,151,"Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,152,I never heard you curse before.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,153,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,154,Are you all right?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,155,"You're all right, yeah."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,156,"Of course you are, my brave little fella."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,157,- It was horrible. - I'm so sorry.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,158,I didn't know until I got back.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,159,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,160,- Never. - I know there's no women allowed.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,161,Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,162,"From now on, wherever you go, I go, too."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,163,Get ready!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,164,- Man the gate! - Ready yourselves!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,165,- Make haste! Prepare! - Up on the Wall!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,166,Quickly! Up!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,167,How many are there?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,168,Beyond the trees!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,169,It's time.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,170,- Light them up! - Light them all!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,171,Move!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,172,Pick up the pace!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,173,Come on!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,174,"Here we go, boys. There's one."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,175,There's two.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,176,"Come on, let's get the next load."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,177,"That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,178,"100,000 you say?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,179,"Yes, ser."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,180,You can say it if you like.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,181,"We should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,182,like you suggested.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,183,"It was a difficult decision either way, ser."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,184,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,185,It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,186,every clever little twat with a mouth.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,187,"But if he starts second-guessing himself,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,188,that's the end
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,189,"for him, for the clever little twats,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,190,for everyone.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,191,This is not the end. Not for us.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,192,Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,193,"And then you get to go on hating me,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,194,and I get to go on wishing your wildling whore had finished the job.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,195,You'll be safe down here.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,196,I'll check on you as soon as I can.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,197,You're leaving me again?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,198,I'm not leaving you.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,199,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,200,You said from now on we'd stay together.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,201,I didn't mean in the same room.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,202,What are you going to do out there?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,203,- Help my brothers. - How?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,204,You're going to fight the free folk when they come? They'll kill you.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,205,"In Mole's Town, they killed everyone."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,206,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,207,Why not?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,208,You won't matter up there. You will down here.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,209,"I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,210,"I made a promise to defend the Wall, and I have to keep it,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,211,because that's what men do.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,212,Promise me you won't die.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,213,I promise you I won't die.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,214,There's a lot more wildlings on the other side of the Wall than this side.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,215,We've got loads of weapons and things.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,216,It's the perfect place for us to be.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,217,I've never thrown a spear before.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,218,I've never held a sword with a proper edge.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,219,This is no place for me to be.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,220,You're not afraid?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,221,Of course I'm afraid.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,222,There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,223,"If you're afraid of a band of wildlings,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,224,how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,225,I didn't know I was going to kill it.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,226,But I had to do something. I didn't have any choice.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,227,It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,228,"If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,229,I wasn't Samwell Tarly any more.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,230,"I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch, or son of Randyll Tarly, or any of that."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,231,I was nothing at all.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,232,"And when you're nothing at all,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,233,there's no more reason to be afraid.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,234,But you're afraid now?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,235,"Yes, well,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,236,I'm not nothing any more.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,237,Most of their men are up top.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,238,Didn't count more than 20 down here. Leftovers.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,239,They got a big fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,240,How high are the walls?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,241,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,242,Let's kill some crows!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,243,Come on!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,244,"Come on, brothers!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,245,"Archers, nock."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,246,"Everyone else, hold."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,247,"Grenn, no!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,248,"I said nock and hold, you cunts!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,249,"- Does nock mean draw? - No, ser!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,250,"- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? - No, ser!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,251,"- You all plan to die here tonight? - No, ser!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,252,That's very good to hear. Draw!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,253,"No, down below!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,254,Draw! Light them up.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,255,"Come on, get up!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,256,They're attacking the southern gate!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,257,- Now? - Now.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,258,I'm going down there.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,259,"- Brother Slynt, you have the Wall. - What?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,260,What are you fucking waiting for? Loose!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,261,You heard the man. Loose!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,262,"You, over there."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,263,- Did you get one? - No.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,264,"- Shit, Pyp! - Shit."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,265,- Sam. - Yeah?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,266,I think we're gonna die.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,267,"If you keep missing, we will."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,268,Come on!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,269,Brothers!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,270,A hundred generations have defended this castle.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,271,She's never fallen before.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,272,She will not fall tonight.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,273,Those are Thenns at our walls.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,274,They eat the flesh of the men they kill.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,275,Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,276,No!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,277,Tonight we fight.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,278,"And when the sun rises, I promise you,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,279,Castle Black will stand!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,280,The Night's Watch will stand!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,281,Yes!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,282,With me now! Now with me!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,283,No discipline. No training.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,284,"Gang of thieves, that's all this is."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,285,I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,286,Those men obeyed orders.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,287,We can't just let them attack the gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,288,The bars of those gates are four inches of cold-rolled steel.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,289,Those are giants riding mammoths down there!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,290,Do you think your cold-rolled steel is gonna stop them?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,291,No such thing as giants.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,292,A story for the children.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,293,Brother Slynt.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,294,We just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,295,"You're the most experienced man he's got, ser, and he needs you."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,296,Needed below?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,297,Yes.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,298,"Archers, nock your arrows!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,299,Nock arrows!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,300,Draw!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,301,Loose!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,302,They won't summit before dawn.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,303,How do you know that?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,304,Because I've made that climb.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,305,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,306,Hold the bridge!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,307,"Hold, wait for it!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,308,Come on with the rocks!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,309,Nock!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,310,Draw!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,311,Loose!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,312,Down!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,313,No!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,314,"To the gate. Come on, let's move."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,315,"Come on, up there!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,316,It's gonna open.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,317,- I got one right through the heart. He's dead. - Oh.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,318,- Is it over? - No.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,319,"Well, then..."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,320,You're all right.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,321,I'll get help.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,322,Maester Aemon is coming.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,323,He's gonna make it all right.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,324,- Now. - Now!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,325,The outer gate won't hold.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,326,"- Take five men, hold the inner gate. - Aye."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,327,Hold the gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,328,If they make it through...
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,329,They won't.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,330,"Come on, Hill. And you, Cooper."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,331,"You three, on me!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,332,"Come on, you lazy bastards!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,333,Oil.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,334,Oil on the ramp!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,335,Protect the gate!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,336,Get him inside.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,337,Hold that fucking gate!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,338,Hold it!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,339,We need more men down here.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,340,- We have to hold the gate. - But we need men here.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,341,Tell Jon. He's in command.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,342,Let's go.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,343,Get me to the top! You hear me?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,344,"Your name's OIly, right?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,345,"Listen to me, OIly. Get me to the top."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,346,"And when we give the signal, bring us back down."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,347,You hear me?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,348,"Find a weapon, OIly. Fight them."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,349,Clear the way! Let's go!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,350,- Out of the way! - Get out of here!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,351,Cut the rope!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,352,Wait! No!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,353,- We need more archers. - Here I am.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,354,- Come on. - Come on. Quickly.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,355,What are you doing up here?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,356,The wildlings are over the walls.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,357,Ser Alliser's fallen.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,358,The castle won't stand much longer.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,359,"Edd, you have the Wall."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,360,"If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,361,"If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,362,"Come, brothers. Now fight with me!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,363,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right, boys?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,364,Light the fuckers up!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,365,Nock! Draw!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,366,Loose!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,367,- How are we gonna stop that? - Shot 20 arrows in him already.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,368,You heard Jon. We hold the gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,369,- Jon Snow's not Lord Commander. - We hold the gate!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,370,"Mother, save me. Father, save me."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,371,The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us. You hear me?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,372,- Please. - Night gathers and now my watch begins.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,373,It shall not end until my death.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,374,"I shall take no wife, hold no lands,"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,375,father no children.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,376,- I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. - Win no glory.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,377,I shall live and die by my post.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,378,I am the sword in the darkness.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,379,I am the watcher on the walls.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,380,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,381,I pledge my life and honour to the Night's Watch
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,382,for this night and all the nights to come!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,383,I don't want you out there.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,384,You can't protect me forever.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,385,There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,386,I need him more than I need you.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,387,"We need you, boy."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,388,Ha!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,389,Jon Snow.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,390,Hush. Don't talk.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,391,Do you remember that cave?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,392,We should have stayed in that cave.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,393,We'll go back there.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,394,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,395,"Drop the scythe, boys!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,396,- Hoist her up. - Hoist her up!
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,397,They've had enough for one night.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,398,Don't cheer too loud.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,399,"They still outnumber us 1,000 to one."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,400,Tormund.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,401,It's over.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,402,Let it end.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,403,This is how a man ends.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,404,Put him in chains.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,405,We'll question him later.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,406,I should have thrown you
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,407,"from the top of the Wall, boy!"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,408,Aye.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,409,You should have.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,410,"Whoa, it's me."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,411,"I promised you, didn't I?"
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,412,We held them off.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,413,For one night.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,414,This is a great victory.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,415,A great victory?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,416,Mance was testing our defences. He almost made it through.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,417,And he has more giants. He has more mammoths.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,418,"He has 1,000 times as many men."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,419,They'll hit us again tonight.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,420,"Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we'll never beat them."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,421,Where are we going?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,422,Going to find Mance.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,423,You can't do that.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,424,No one gave you any orders.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,425,Who's left to give orders?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,426,The wildling army's only an army because of Mance.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,427,He united 100 warring tribes.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,428,"Without Mance, they lose their leader."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,429,They lose their purpose. They go back to fighting each other.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,430,Scatter back to their homes.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,431,Without Mance?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,432,You're going to kill him?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,433,I'm gonna try.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,434,They'll never let you within 100 yards of him.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,435,"And even if they did, even if you managed to kill him..."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,436,"They'll kill me? If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,437,"They'll kill the rest of us, too."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,438,They won't just kill you.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,439,"They'll boil you, flay you, make it last days."
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,440,You're right. It's a bad plan.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,441,What's your plan?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,442,They held the gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,443,Get some brothers down here to help you.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,444,We need to burn the bodies.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,445,Raise the outer gate.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,446,Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,447,What are you doing?
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,448,I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,449,In case I don't come back.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,450,Jon.
S04E09,The Watchers On The Wall,451,Come back.
S04E10,The Children,1,You're wearing a black cloak again.
S04E10,The Children,2,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
S04E10,The Children,3,It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.
S04E10,The Children,4,It's happened before.
S04E10,The Children,5,"I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow."
S04E10,The Children,6,"Truly, I was."
S04E10,The Children,7,The Halfhand ordered me to join your army
S04E10,The Children,8,and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.
S04E10,The Children,9,He made me kill him so you'd trust me.
S04E10,The Children,10,I was loyal
S04E10,The Children,11,to him and to my Night's Watch vows.
S04E10,The Children,12,All your vows?
S04E10,The Children,13,"She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?"
S04E10,The Children,14,Were you enough to turn her?
S04E10,The Children,15,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
S04E10,The Children,16,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
S04E10,The Children,17,Yes.
S04E10,The Children,18,And?
S04E10,The Children,19,She's dead.
S04E10,The Children,20,Your doing?
S04E10,The Children,21,No.
S04E10,The Children,22,We'll drink to her.
S04E10,The Children,23,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
S04E10,The Children,24,- Ygritte. - Ygritte.
S04E10,The Children,25,That's not wine.
S04E10,The Children,26,"No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow."
S04E10,The Children,27,You did well. Fought hard.
S04E10,The Children,28,Killed some of our strongest men.
S04E10,The Children,29,One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again.
S04E10,The Children,30,Mag the Mighty.
S04E10,The Children,31,He's dead.
S04E10,The Children,32,He killed my friend Grenn.
S04E10,The Children,33,He was their king.
S04E10,The Children,34,The last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
S04E10,The Children,35,Grenn came from a farm.
S04E10,The Children,36,- Mag and Grenn. - Grenn and Mag.
S04E10,The Children,37,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?"
S04E10,The Children,38,I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything for quite some time.
S04E10,The Children,39,"So, you're here to strike a bargain?"
S04E10,The Children,40,Turn your army around and go home.
S04E10,The Children,41,"You know I know you're low on arrows,"
S04E10,The Children,42,"you're low on oil, you're low on men."
S04E10,The Children,43,"How many are left, 50?"
S04E10,The Children,44,I told Tormund and Orell.
S04E10,The Children,45,"We have more than 1,000 men."
S04E10,The Children,46,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, 100,000 strong."
S04E10,The Children,47,And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had.
S04E10,The Children,48,It wasn't much.
S04E10,The Children,49,"As soon as I saw that, I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,"
S04E10,The Children,50,an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.
S04E10,The Children,51,"A lot of them will die climbing,"
S04E10,The Children,52,but most of them will be over by the end of the day.
S04E10,The Children,53,"It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me."
S04E10,The Children,54,My people have bled enough.
S04E10,The Children,55,We're not here to conquer.
S04E10,The Children,56,We're here to hide behind your Wall. Just like you.
S04E10,The Children,57,We need your tunnel.
S04E10,The Children,58,Now we both know that winter is coming.
S04E10,The Children,59,"And if my people aren't south of the Wall when it comes in earnest,"
S04E10,The Children,60,we'll all end up worse than dead.
S04E10,The Children,61,You want to strike a bargain with me? Here's the bargain.
S04E10,The Children,62,"You go back, you open the gates to us,"
S04E10,The Children,63,and I swear to you that no one else will die.
S04E10,The Children,64,"Refuse,"
S04E10,The Children,65,and we'll kill every last man at Castle Black.
S04E10,The Children,66,Ah!
S04E10,The Children,67,Oh...
S04E10,The Children,68,That's why you're here.
S04E10,The Children,69,I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.
S04E10,The Children,70,"They'd kill you, of course."
S04E10,The Children,71,They'd kill you slow.
S04E10,The Children,72,But you knew that when you came in here.
S04E10,The Children,73,"Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?"
S04E10,The Children,74,Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered you peace?
S04E10,The Children,75,Is that what the Night's Watch is?
S04E10,The Children,76,Is that what you are?
S04E10,The Children,77,Riders coming!
S04E10,The Children,78,- Are you attacking us? - No.
S04E10,The Children,79,"It's like you said, we don't have the men."
S04E10,The Children,80,Hold! To me! To me!
S04E10,The Children,81,Stand down!
S04E10,The Children,82,"I said my people have bled enough,"
S04E10,The Children,83,and I meant it.
S04E10,The Children,84,Round them up.
S04E10,The Children,85,Stay with the horses.
S04E10,The Children,86,You're the King-beyond-the-Wall?
S04E10,The Children,87,- Do you know who I am? - Never had the pleasure.
S04E10,The Children,88,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms."
S04E10,The Children,89,"We're not in the Seven Kingdoms, and you're not dressed for this weather."
S04E10,The Children,90,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
S04E10,The Children,91,We do not kneel.
S04E10,The Children,92,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall,"
S04E10,The Children,93,"have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them."
S04E10,The Children,94,I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.
S04E10,The Children,95,Their fate depends on their king.
S04E10,The Children,96,"All the same, we do not kneel."
S04E10,The Children,97,Take these men away.
S04E10,The Children,98,What's a man of the Night's Watch doing in a wildling camp?
S04E10,The Children,99,I was sent to discuss terms with the King-beyond-the-Wall.
S04E10,The Children,100,"You're speaking to the one true king, boy."
S04E10,The Children,101,"You will address him as ""Your Grace."""
S04E10,The Children,102,I know he's the king. My father died for him.
S04E10,The Children,103,"My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,104,I'm Ned Stark's son.
S04E10,The Children,105,Your father was an honourable man.
S04E10,The Children,106,"He was, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,107,What do you think he'd have done with him?
S04E10,The Children,108,I was this man's prisoner once.
S04E10,The Children,109,He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.
S04E10,The Children,110,But he spared my life.
S04E10,The Children,111,"I think my father would have taken him prisoner,"
S04E10,The Children,112,listened to what he had to say.
S04E10,The Children,113,"Very well, then. Take him."
S04E10,The Children,114,Your Grace.
S04E10,The Children,115,"If my father had seen the things that I've seen,"
S04E10,The Children,116,he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.
S04E10,The Children,117,All of them.
S04E10,The Children,118,"I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain,"
S04E10,The Children,119,- but he is completely insensate. - Bloody Martells.
S04E10,The Children,120,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
S04E10,The Children,121,It is. The Death's Head manticore.
S04E10,The Children,122,I've read a great deal about it. It's a horrible poison.
S04E10,The Children,123,Usually Mantari in origin.
S04E10,The Children,124,Oh!
S04E10,The Children,125,There's nothing to be done.
S04E10,The Children,126,"Yes, there is."
S04E10,The Children,127,May I ask what you think you're doing?
S04E10,The Children,128,Saving him.
S04E10,The Children,129,"Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving."
S04E10,The Children,130,"Well, well beyond."
S04E10,The Children,131,"This man is not even a maester, let alone grand maester."
S04E10,The Children,132,That's for the best. No maester knows how to save him.
S04E10,The Children,133,That is exactly the sort of arrogance
S04E10,The Children,134,"that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,135,His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.
S04E10,The Children,136,"Rightly so, in my opinion."
S04E10,The Children,137,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
S04E10,The Children,138,"But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory."
S04E10,The Children,139,- Not any more. - But...
S04E10,The Children,140,"- You can save him? - Difficult to say, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,141,But if my past work is any guide...
S04E10,The Children,142,...we stand a chance.
S04E10,The Children,143,Do everything you can.
S04E10,The Children,144,Come to me for anything you need.
S04E10,The Children,145,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,146,"You should know,"
S04E10,The Children,147,the process may change him
S04E10,The Children,148,somewhat.
S04E10,The Children,149,Will it weaken him?
S04E10,The Children,150,"Oh, no."
S04E10,The Children,151,"Very well, then."
S04E10,The Children,152,Not another word.
S04E10,The Children,153,We've been over this. The matter's closed.
S04E10,The Children,154,I'm opening it again.
S04E10,The Children,155,You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
S04E10,The Children,156,You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
S04E10,The Children,157,And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
S04E10,The Children,158,I will not.
S04E10,The Children,159,Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.
S04E10,The Children,160,Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow.
S04E10,The Children,161,You have on several occasions made great claims
S04E10,The Children,162,about your commitment to this family's future.
S04E10,The Children,163,Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.
S04E10,The Children,164,I don't care.
S04E10,The Children,165,"I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
S04E10,The Children,166,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital."
S04E10,The Children,167,I decided to take your brother with me and not you.
S04E10,The Children,168,You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
S04E10,The Children,169,- lf you recall... - I'm not interested in hearing
S04E10,The Children,170,another one of your smug stories about the time you won.
S04E10,The Children,171,This isn't going to be one of those times.
S04E10,The Children,172,Do you think you'll be the first person
S04E10,The Children,173,dragged into a Sept to be married against her will?
S04E10,The Children,174,When you marched into the throne room to tell me
S04E10,The Children,175,"we'd won the Battle of Blackwater, do you remember?"
S04E10,The Children,176,I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.
S04E10,The Children,177,I was about to give him essence of nightshade.
S04E10,The Children,178,That's how far I was willing to go
S04E10,The Children,179,when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away.
S04E10,The Children,180,Someone awful is coming to take him away.
S04E10,The Children,181,No.
S04E10,The Children,182,Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock.
S04E10,The Children,183,And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.
S04E10,The Children,184,My last boy.
S04E10,The Children,185,"Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in,"
S04E10,The Children,186,and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart.
S04E10,The Children,187,I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.
S04E10,The Children,188,And how will you do that?
S04E10,The Children,189,I'll tell everyone the truth.
S04E10,The Children,190,What truth would that be?
S04E10,The Children,191,"You don't know, do you?"
S04E10,The Children,192,You never believed it.
S04E10,The Children,193,How is that possible?
S04E10,The Children,194,What am I saying? Of course it's possible.
S04E10,The Children,195,How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family
S04E10,The Children,196,have any conception what his actual family was doing?
S04E10,The Children,197,"We were right there in front of you, and you didn't see us."
S04E10,The Children,198,One real look in the past 20 years
S04E10,The Children,199,at your own children and you would have known.
S04E10,The Children,200,Known what?
S04E10,The Children,201,Everything they say is true
S04E10,The Children,202,- about Jaime and me. - No.
S04E10,The Children,203,"- Your legacy is a lie. - No, no, no, no."
S04E10,The Children,204,I don't believe you.
S04E10,The Children,205,"Yes, you do."
S04E10,The Children,206,CERSEl: Jaime.
S04E10,The Children,207,You won.
S04E10,The Children,208,One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.
S04E10,The Children,209,"There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
S04E10,The Children,210,"For my family, no, nothing."
S04E10,The Children,211,I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.
S04E10,The Children,212,- Tyrion is your family. - He's not.
S04E10,The Children,213,- You don't get to choose. - I do. So do you.
S04E10,The Children,214,You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world...
S04E10,The Children,215,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?
S04E10,The Children,216,He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
S04E10,The Children,217,A disease doesn't decide to kill you.
S04E10,The Children,218,"All the same, you cut it out before it does."
S04E10,The Children,219,What do you decide?
S04E10,The Children,220,"- What do you choose? - The things I did to get back to you,"
S04E10,The Children,221,"to endure all that, only to find you..."
S04E10,The Children,222,I choose you.
S04E10,The Children,223,- Those are words. - Yes.
S04E10,The Children,224,Like the ones I just said to Father.
S04E10,The Children,225,I told him.
S04E10,The Children,226,Told him what?
S04E10,The Children,227,I told him about us.
S04E10,The Children,228,- You told him? - I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.
S04E10,The Children,229,"I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
S04E10,The Children,230,- You think he'll just accept that? - Go and ask him.
S04E10,The Children,231,What did you say?
S04E10,The Children,232,I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.
S04E10,The Children,233,I don't choose Tywin Lannister.
S04E10,The Children,234,I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother.
S04E10,The Children,235,I love my lover.
S04E10,The Children,236,"People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them."
S04E10,The Children,237,"They're all so small, I can't even see them."
S04E10,The Children,238,I only see what matters.
S04E10,The Children,239,- Someone will walk in. - I don't care.
S04E10,The Children,240,"You stand before Daenerys Stormborn,"
S04E10,The Children,241,"the Unburnt,"
S04E10,The Children,242,"Queen of Meereen,"
S04E10,The Children,243,Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men.
S04E10,The Children,244,"Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,"
S04E10,The Children,245,Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
S04E10,The Children,246,"Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,247,My name is Fennesz.
S04E10,The Children,248,"I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish."
S04E10,The Children,249,You speak it very well.
S04E10,The Children,250,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal."
S04E10,The Children,251,I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history.
S04E10,The Children,252,They know a great deal about your family because of me.
S04E10,The Children,253,"Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
S04E10,The Children,254,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.
S04E10,The Children,255,What can I do for you?
S04E10,The Children,256,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house."
S04E10,The Children,257,But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.
S04E10,The Children,258,So I lost my home.
S04E10,The Children,259,Now I live on the streets.
S04E10,The Children,260,I have outfitted mess halls
S04E10,The Children,261,to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
S04E10,The Children,262,"I do not mean to offend, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,263,I went to one of these places.
S04E10,The Children,264,"The young prey on the old,"
S04E10,The Children,265,take what they want and beat us if we resist.
S04E10,The Children,266,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend,"
S04E10,The Children,267,this I promise you.
S04E10,The Children,268,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there?"
S04E10,The Children,269,What purpose would I serve?
S04E10,The Children,270,"With my master, I was a teacher."
S04E10,The Children,271,I had the respect and love of his children.
S04E10,The Children,272,What is it that you want from me?
S04E10,The Children,273,"Your Grace,"
S04E10,The Children,274,I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
S04E10,The Children,275,You want to return to a man who owned you
S04E10,The Children,276,like a goat or a chair?
S04E10,The Children,277,"Please, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,278,"The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them,"
S04E10,The Children,279,"but for those of us too old to change,"
S04E10,The Children,280,there is only fear and squalor.
S04E10,The Children,281,I am not alone.
S04E10,The Children,282,There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.
S04E10,The Children,283,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy.
S04E10,The Children,284,I took it to bring people freedom.
S04E10,The Children,285,But freedom means making your own choices.
S04E10,The Children,286,I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.
S04E10,The Children,287,It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
S04E10,The Children,288,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,289,Thank you.
S04E10,The Children,290,The masters will take advantage of this situation.
S04E10,The Children,291,The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
S04E10,The Children,292,"Approach, my friend."
S04E10,The Children,293,"I do not understand, my Queen."
S04E10,The Children,294,"I do not understand, my Queen."
S04E10,The Children,295,The Queen says you may approach.
S04E10,The Children,296,MISSANDEl: I have brought you...
S04E10,The Children,297,He came from the sky.
S04E10,The Children,298,MISSANDEl: The black one.
S04E10,The Children,299,The winged shadow.
S04E10,The Children,300,MISSANDEl: He came from the sky and...
S04E10,The Children,301,MISSANDEl: My girl.
S04E10,The Children,302,My little girl.
S04E10,The Children,303,What was her name?
S04E10,The Children,304,"MISSANDEl: Zala, Your Grace."
S04E10,The Children,305,- How old was she? - Three.
S04E10,The Children,306,Three.
S04E10,The Children,307,And still no word of Drogon?
S04E10,The Children,308,"Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my Queen."
S04E10,The Children,309,Nothing since then.
S04E10,The Children,310,Meet me at the catacombs.
S04E10,The Children,311,"They came to us from White Harbour and Barrowton,"
S04E10,The Children,312,"from Fairmarket and King's Landing,"
S04E10,The Children,313,"from north and south,"
S04E10,The Children,314,from east and west.
S04E10,The Children,315,They died
S04E10,The Children,316,"protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names."
S04E10,The Children,317,It is for us to remember them.
S04E10,The Children,318,"Our brothers,"
S04E10,The Children,319,we shall never see their like again.
S04E10,The Children,320,And now their watch is ended.
S04E10,The Children,321,And now their watch is ended.
S04E10,The Children,322,Your old blind man patched me up.
S04E10,The Children,323,Why?
S04E10,The Children,324,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
S04E10,The Children,325,You want me alive so you can torture me?
S04E10,The Children,326,No one's gonna torture you.
S04E10,The Children,327,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?
S04E10,The Children,328,Drop us from the top of the Wall?
S04E10,The Children,329,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
S04E10,The Children,330,Who decides?
S04E10,The Children,331,I suppose Stannis does.
S04E10,The Children,332,He your king now?
S04E10,The Children,333,I don't have a king.
S04E10,The Children,334,"You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow."
S04E10,The Children,335,You can never be a kneeler again.
S04E10,The Children,336,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead.
S04E10,The Children,337,- Do you want to say any words over them? - Words? What kind of words?
S04E10,The Children,338,Funeral words. I don't know how the free folk do it.
S04E10,The Children,339,Do what?
S04E10,The Children,340,Say farewell.
S04E10,The Children,341,"The dead can't hear us, boy."
S04E10,The Children,342,Snow.
S04E10,The Children,343,Did you love her?
S04E10,The Children,344,She loved you.
S04E10,The Children,345,- She told you? - No.
S04E10,The Children,346,All she ever talked about was killing you.
S04E10,The Children,347,That's how I know.
S04E10,The Children,348,She belongs in the North.
S04E10,The Children,349,The real North.
S04E10,The Children,350,You understand me?
S04E10,The Children,351,We can stop. We can rest.
S04E10,The Children,352,We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
S04E10,The Children,353,We're not going to make it.
S04E10,The Children,354,We're already here.
S04E10,The Children,355,Jojen.
S04E10,The Children,356,Jojen.
S04E10,The Children,357,"Look, Jojen."
S04E10,The Children,358,Jojen! Come on!
S04E10,The Children,359,Help them! Now!
S04E10,The Children,360,Hold on to me!
S04E10,The Children,361,Hang on!
S04E10,The Children,362,- Hodor. Hodor. - Help them!
S04E10,The Children,363,Hodor.
S04E10,The Children,364,Hodor!
S04E10,The Children,365,Hodor!
S04E10,The Children,366,Hodor.
S04E10,The Children,367,Hodor!
S04E10,The Children,368,Bran!
S04E10,The Children,369,"Save yourself, now!"
S04E10,The Children,370,"Come with me, Brandon Stark."
S04E10,The Children,371,He is lost.
S04E10,The Children,372,Come with me or die with him.
S04E10,The Children,373,Go with them.
S04E10,The Children,374,They cannot follow us.
S04E10,The Children,375,The power that moves them is powerless here.
S04E10,The Children,376,Who are you?
S04E10,The Children,377,"The First Men called us the Children, but we were born long before them."
S04E10,The Children,378,"Come, he waits for you."
S04E10,The Children,379,You're the three-eyed raven?
S04E10,The Children,380,I've been many things.
S04E10,The Children,381,Now I am what you see.
S04E10,The Children,382,"My brother, he led us to you and now he..."
S04E10,The Children,383,He knew what would happen.
S04E10,The Children,384,"From the moment he left,"
S04E10,The Children,385,he knew and he went anyway.
S04E10,The Children,386,How do you know?
S04E10,The Children,387,I've been watching you.
S04E10,The Children,388,All of you.
S04E10,The Children,389,All of your lives.
S04E10,The Children,390,"With 1,000 eyes and one."
S04E10,The Children,391,"Now you've come to me at last,"
S04E10,The Children,392,Brandon Stark.
S04E10,The Children,393,Though the hour is late.
S04E10,The Children,394,I didn't want anyone to die for me.
S04E10,The Children,395,He died so you could find what you have lost.
S04E10,The Children,396,You're going to help me walk again?
S04E10,The Children,397,You will never walk again.
S04E10,The Children,398,But you will fly.
S04E10,The Children,399,Podrick.
S04E10,The Children,400,Podrick.
S04E10,The Children,401,Where are the horses?
S04E10,The Children,402,I hobbled them last night.
S04E10,The Children,403,What sort of hobble?
S04E10,The Children,404,"A figure eight, like you taught me."
S04E10,The Children,405,"If you did it like I taught you, then the horses would be here."
S04E10,The Children,406,"Thieves, maybe?"
S04E10,The Children,407,It's at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here.
S04E10,The Children,408,You're carrying the saddlebags.
S04E10,The Children,409,People coming.
S04E10,The Children,410,You can shit later. There's people coming.
S04E10,The Children,411,Morning.
S04E10,The Children,412,Morning.
S04E10,The Children,413,I like your sword.
S04E10,The Children,414,Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?
S04E10,The Children,415,About 10 more miles.
S04E10,The Children,416,"Did you hear that, Podrick?"
S04E10,The Children,417,Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.
S04E10,The Children,418,Are you a knight?
S04E10,The Children,419,No.
S04E10,The Children,420,But you know how to use that sword?
S04E10,The Children,421,I do.
S04E10,The Children,422,Does it have a name?
S04E10,The Children,423,Oathkeeper.
S04E10,The Children,424,Mine's Needle.
S04E10,The Children,425,Good name.
S04E10,The Children,426,Who taught you how to fight?
S04E10,The Children,427,My father.
S04E10,The Children,428,Mine never wanted to.
S04E10,The Children,429,Said fighting was for boys.
S04E10,The Children,430,Mine said the same.
S04E10,The Children,431,But I kept fighting the boys anyway.
S04E10,The Children,432,Kept losing.
S04E10,The Children,433,"Finally my father said,"
S04E10,The Children,434,"""If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right."""
S04E10,The Children,435,Seven blessings.
S04E10,The Children,436,I'm Brienne of Tarth. This is Podrick Payne.
S04E10,The Children,437,You want something?
S04E10,The Children,438,That's Sandor Clegane. The Hound.
S04E10,The Children,439,You're Arya Stark.
S04E10,The Children,440,I asked if you wanted something.
S04E10,The Children,441,I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
S04E10,The Children,442,- My mother's dead. - I know.
S04E10,The Children,443,I wish I could have been there to protect her.
S04E10,The Children,444,You're not a Northerner.
S04E10,The Children,445,"No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
S04E10,The Children,446,Why didn't you?
S04E10,The Children,447,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.
S04E10,The Children,448,You're paid by the Lannisters.
S04E10,The Children,449,You're here for the bounty on me.
S04E10,The Children,450,I'm not paid by the Lannisters.
S04E10,The Children,451,No?
S04E10,The Children,452,Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it?
S04E10,The Children,453,I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life.
S04E10,The Children,454,"Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth."
S04E10,The Children,455,Tell me that's not Lannister gold.
S04E10,The Children,456,Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
S04E10,The Children,457,The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.
S04E10,The Children,458,I swore to your mother by the old gods and the new.
S04E10,The Children,459,I don't care what you swore.
S04E10,The Children,460,- Arya! - You heard the girl.
S04E10,The Children,461,- She's not coming with you. - She is.
S04E10,The Children,462,You're not a good listener.
S04E10,The Children,463,Valyrian steel?
S04E10,The Children,464,I always wanted some Valyrian steel.
S04E10,The Children,465,"Come with me, Arya. I'll take you to safety."
S04E10,The Children,466,Safety? Where the fuck's that?
S04E10,The Children,467,Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.
S04E10,The Children,468,Her mother's dead. Her father's dead. Her brother's dead.
S04E10,The Children,469,Winterfell is a pile of rubble.
S04E10,The Children,470,"There is no safety, you dumb bitch."
S04E10,The Children,471,"You don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her."
S04E10,The Children,472,And that's what you're doing?
S04E10,The Children,473,Watching over her?
S04E10,The Children,474,"Aye, that's what I'm doing."
S04E10,The Children,475,"I have no wish to kill you, Ser."
S04E10,The Children,476,I'm not a knight.
S04E10,The Children,477,Arya!
S04E10,The Children,478,Arya!
S04E10,The Children,479,Arya!
S04E10,The Children,480,- Where is she? - She was just here.
S04E10,The Children,481,Why weren't you watching her?
S04E10,The Children,482,I was watching you. I thought you might need some help.
S04E10,The Children,483,"Which way, Pod? Which way did she go?"
S04E10,The Children,484,I think that way.
S04E10,The Children,485,Arya!
S04E10,The Children,486,Arya!
S04E10,The Children,487,You still here?
S04E10,The Children,488,Big bitch saved you.
S04E10,The Children,489,I don't need saving.
S04E10,The Children,490,"No, not you. You're a real killer."
S04E10,The Children,491,With your water dancing
S04E10,The Children,492,and your Needle.
S04E10,The Children,493,You gonna die?
S04E10,The Children,494,"Unless there's a maester hiding behind that rock,"
S04E10,The Children,495,"aye,"
S04E10,The Children,496,I'm done.
S04E10,The Children,497,I'd skin you alive for wine.
S04E10,The Children,498,Fuck water.
S04E10,The Children,499,Killed by a woman.
S04E10,The Children,500,I bet you like that.
S04E10,The Children,501,"Go on,"
S04E10,The Children,502,go after her.
S04E10,The Children,503,She'll help you.
S04E10,The Children,504,"Going it alone,"
S04E10,The Children,505,you won't last a day out there.
S04E10,The Children,506,I'll last longer than you.
S04E10,The Children,507,You remember where the heart is?
S04E10,The Children,508,Fuck it. I'm ready.
S04E10,The Children,509,"Go on, girl."
S04E10,The Children,510,Another name off your list.
S04E10,The Children,511,You kept promising me.
S04E10,The Children,512,I cut down your butcher's boy. The ginger.
S04E10,The Children,513,He was begging for mercy.
S04E10,The Children,514,"""Please, Ser. Please don't kill me."
S04E10,The Children,515,"""Please, please."""
S04E10,The Children,516,Bled all over my horse.
S04E10,The Children,517,Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks.
S04E10,The Children,518,And your sister.
S04E10,The Children,519,Your pretty sister.
S04E10,The Children,520,I should have taken her.
S04E10,The Children,521,That night the Blackwater burned.
S04E10,The Children,522,I should have fucked her bloody.
S04E10,The Children,523,At least I'd have one happy memory.
S04E10,The Children,524,Do I have to beg you?
S04E10,The Children,525,Do it.
S04E10,The Children,526,Do it.
S04E10,The Children,527,Do it.
S04E10,The Children,528,Kill me.
S04E10,The Children,529,Kill me!
S04E10,The Children,530,Kill me!
S04E10,The Children,531,Kill me!
S04E10,The Children,532,"Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore."
S04E10,The Children,533,Is that any way to speak about our mother?
S04E10,The Children,534,- What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing?
S04E10,The Children,535,A galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
S04E10,The Children,536,- Who's helping you? - Varys.
S04E10,The Children,537,- Varys? - You have more friends than you thought.
S04E10,The Children,538,There's a locked door at the top of the stairs.
S04E10,The Children,539,"Knock on it twice, then twice again."
S04E10,The Children,540,Varys will open.
S04E10,The Children,541,"I suppose this is goodbye, then."
S04E10,The Children,542,"Farewell, little brother."
S04E10,The Children,543,Jaime.
S04E10,The Children,544,Thank you. For my life.
S04E10,The Children,545,Quickly now.
S04E10,The Children,546,Tywin?
S04E10,The Children,547,My lion.
S04E10,The Children,548,I'm sorry.
S04E10,The Children,549,I'm sorry.
S04E10,The Children,550,Tyrion.
S04E10,The Children,551,Put down the crossbow.
S04E10,The Children,552,Who released you?
S04E10,The Children,553,"Your brother, I expect. He always had a soft spot for you."
S04E10,The Children,554,"Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers."
S04E10,The Children,555,"This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?"
S04E10,The Children,556,Shaming your father has always given you pleasure...
S04E10,The Children,557,All my life
S04E10,The Children,558,you've wanted me dead.
S04E10,The Children,559,Yes.
S04E10,The Children,560,But you refused to die.
S04E10,The Children,561,I respect that.
S04E10,The Children,562,Even admire it.
S04E10,The Children,563,You fight for what's yours.
S04E10,The Children,564,I'd never let them execute you. Is that what you fear?
S04E10,The Children,565,I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.
S04E10,The Children,566,You're a Lannister.
S04E10,The Children,567,You're my son.
S04E10,The Children,568,I loved her.
S04E10,The Children,569,Who?
S04E10,The Children,570,Shae.
S04E10,The Children,571,"Oh, Tyrion."
S04E10,The Children,572,Put down that crossbow.
S04E10,The Children,573,I murdered her.
S04E10,The Children,574,With my own hands.
S04E10,The Children,575,It doesn't matter.
S04E10,The Children,576,Doesn't matter?
S04E10,The Children,577,She was a whore.
S04E10,The Children,578,- Say that word again... - And what?
S04E10,The Children,579,You'll kill your own father in the privy?
S04E10,The Children,580,No.
S04E10,The Children,581,You're my son.
S04E10,The Children,582,"Now, enough of this nonsense."
S04E10,The Children,583,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die."
S04E10,The Children,584,"You knew I didn't poison Joffrey,"
S04E10,The Children,585,but you sentenced me all the same.
S04E10,The Children,586,- Why? - Enough.
S04E10,The Children,587,We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
S04E10,The Children,588,I can't go back there. She's in there.
S04E10,The Children,589,You're afraid of a dead whore?
S04E10,The Children,590,You shot me.
S04E10,The Children,591,You're no son of mine.
S04E10,The Children,592,I am your son.
S04E10,The Children,593,I have always been your son.
S04E10,The Children,594,What have you done?
S04E10,The Children,595,Quickly.
S04E10,The Children,596,"Trust me, my friend. I've brought you this far."
S04E10,The Children,597,I want to see the captain.
S04E10,The Children,598,You're seeing him.
S04E10,The Children,599,"I want to go north, to the Wall."
S04E10,The Children,600,"No, you don't."
S04E10,The Children,601,I can pay.
S04E10,The Children,602,There is nothing in the North but ice and war and pirates.
S04E10,The Children,603,I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.
S04E10,The Children,604,I could work scrubbing the floors...
S04E10,The Children,605,"I'm not going north, child. I'm going home."
S04E10,The Children,606,- Where's home? - The Free City of Braavos.
S04E10,The Children,607,Wait. I have something else.
S04E10,The Children,608,- More silver won't make a difference. - It's not silver.
S04E10,The Children,609,It's iron.
S04E10,The Children,610,This...
S04E10,The Children,611,- How did you... - Valar Morghulis.
S04E10,The Children,612,Valar Dohaeris.
S04E10,The Children,613,"Of course, you shall have a cabin."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,1,- We shouldn't be out here alone. - Why not?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,2,- If your father... - He'll never know we're gone.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,3,But if he finds out...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,4,You don't need to be afraid of my father.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,5,Are you sure?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,6,Yes.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,7,- We shouldn't go in. - Of course we should.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,8,Get out. Get out!
S05E01,The Wars To Come,9,- Let's go. - No.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,10,Listen to your friend.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,11,They said that you were terrifying
S05E01,The Wars To Come,12,with cat's teeth and three eyes.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,13,You're not terrifying.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,14,You're boring.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,15,You don't know what I am.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,16,I know you're a witch and you can see the future.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,17,Tell me mine.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,18,Everyone wants to know their future
S05E01,The Wars To Come,19,until they know their future.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,20,This is my father's land. My land.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,21,Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,22,Your blood.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,23,Give me a taste.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,24,Three questions you get.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,25,You won't like the answers.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,26,I've been promised to the prince.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,27,When will we marry?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,28,You will never wed the prince.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,29,You will wed the king.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,30,But I will be queen?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,31,"Oh, yes."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,32,You'll be queen.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,33,For a time.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,34,"Then comes another,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,35,"younger,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,36,"<i>more beautiful,</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,37,<i>to cast you down and take all you hold dear.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,38,W-will the king and I have children?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,39,No. The king will have 20 children and you will have three.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,40,That doesn't make sense.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,41,Gold will be their crowns.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,42,Gold their shrouds.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,43,"Come on, we have to go."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,44,We have to go! Cersei!
S05E01,The Wars To Come,45,"<i>Bearers, put it down.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,46,"<i>Bearers, up.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,47,<i>Away.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,48,"<i>Your Grace, we are honored by your presence.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,49,<i>The mourners are waiting.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,50,They will keep waiting.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,51,I want a moment alone with him.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,52,"But, Your Grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,53,day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,54,They will wait.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,55,"He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,56,"but here you are, protecting his dead body."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,57,"What he built, it's ours."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,58,He built it for us. He meant it for us.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,59,They're going to try to take it away.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,60,- All of it. - They?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,61,"All of them out there, our enemies."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,62,They're waiting in line to make sure he's really dead.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,63,"And as soon as they see the stones on his eyes,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,64,they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,65,They have nothing to do with it.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,66,"The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,67,He's the enemy. I've been telling you for years.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,68,You've been defending him for years.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,69,This is exactly what they want.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,70,And now our father is dead
S05E01,The Wars To Come,71,and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,72,Did you set him free?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,73,"Tyrion may be a monster,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,74,but at least he killed our father on purpose.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,75,You killed him by mistake.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,76,With stupidity.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,77,"You're a man of action, aren't you?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,78,"When it occurs to you to do something, you do it."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,79,Never mind the consequences.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,80,Take a look.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,81,Look at the consequences.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,82,Here they are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,83,He loved you more than anyone in this world.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,84,Apologies.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,85,I still don't see why I had to stay
S05E01,The Wars To Come,86,in this fucking crate once we set sail.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,87,I saved your life.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,88,"If they catch you, they catch me."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,89,I cannot say I feel overly guilty
S05E01,The Wars To Come,90,about leaving you in that fucking crate.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,91,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit
S05E01,The Wars To Come,92,through one of those airholes?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,93,"No, I only know what it's like"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,94,to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,95,Pentos?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,96,"The home of my colleague Illyrio Mopatis,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,97,a merchant.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,98,He and I met many years ago
S05E01,The Wars To Come,99,through mutual friends.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,100,A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon
S05E01,The Wars To Come,101,for the disaster he was.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,102,We tried to do what was best for the realm
S05E01,The Wars To Come,103,by supporting a Targaryen restoration.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,104,And thus began the chain of mistakes
S05E01,The Wars To Come,105,that has led us both here.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,106,"Things have gotten worse, not better."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,107,Westeros needs to be saved from itself.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,108,Mmm.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,109,Much better.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,110,My lord?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,111,I don't think I am anymore.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,112,A lord.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,113,Are you a lord if you kill your father?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,114,I don't imagine they revoke your nobility
S05E01,The Wars To Come,115,for killing a whore.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,116,It must happen all the time.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,117,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,118,In a box. Why stop now?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,119,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,120,The future is shit.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,121,Just like the past.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,122,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,123,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,124,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,125,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,126,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,127,Shh.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,128,Shh.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,129,<i>The Sons of the Harpy?</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,130,"Yes, Your Grace. They left it on the body."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,131,They've never killed before.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,132,"It was only a matter of time, Your Grace."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,133,Conquerors always meet with resistance.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,134,I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,135,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,136,_
S05E01,The Wars To Come,137,He did not risk his life fighting for his freedom
S05E01,The Wars To Come,138,so cowards in masks could take it away.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,139,And I did not take up residence in this pyramid
S05E01,The Wars To Come,140,so I could watch the city below decline into chaos.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,141,What was the name of the man you lost?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,142,"White Rat, Your Grace."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,143,"I want him buried with honor, publically"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,144,in the Temple of the Graces.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,145,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,146,Make them very angry.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,147,Angry snakes lash out.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,148,Makes chopping off their heads that much easier.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,149,Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,150,Your Grace.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,151,Torgo Nudho.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,152,Missandei hin Naath.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,153,I wanted to speak with you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,154,Why do you come?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,155,"White Rat, the Unsullied who..."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,156,I have heard they found his body in a brothel.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,157,I have heard that more than one Unsullied
S05E01,The Wars To Come,158,has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,159,May I ask you why?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,160,Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,161,I do not know.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,162,<i>I must go.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,163,- Get your shield up. - It's too heavy.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,164,"If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,165,Now get it up.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,166,Come. Try it again.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,167,Drive at me. Keep your shield up.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,168,Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,169,"Shouldn't you be training, too?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,170,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,171,How many brothers can say that they've killed a white walker and a Thenn?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,172,I might be the first in history.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,173,<i>- Shield up.</i> <i>- These men need a firm hand.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,174,Always have.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,175,They're poachers and thieves.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,176,Not soldiers.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,177,That one hates me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,178,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,179,He hates the wildlings.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,180,All the wildlings.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,181,- Don't let them send us away. - <i> It's not a sure thing.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,182,Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years
S05E01,The Wars To Come,183,and people say he's a good man.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,184,He's running against Ser Alliser...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,185,"Sam, don't let them send us away."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,186,I told you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,187,"Wherever you go, I go, too."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,188,You can't leave. They'll execute you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,189,"- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot. - Yah!"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,190,Shield up.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,191,The king wants a word.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,192,"You're not cold, my lady?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,193,Never.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,194,"The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,195,Feel.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,196,Are you a virgin?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,197,No.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,198,Good.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,199,Your Grace.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,200,The bastard of Winterfell.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,201,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,202,Roose Bolton.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,203,"Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger in Robb Stark's heart."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,204,Don't you want to avenge him?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,205,"I want a great many things, Your Grace."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,206,But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,207,I've been talking to your sworn brothers.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,208,- Many of them love you. - They're good men.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,209,<i>Many don't.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,210,You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,211,<i>Why?</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,212,It's where she belonged.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,213,Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
S05E01,The Wars To Come,214,too much affection for the wildlings.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,215,They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,216,That doesn't make them monsters.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,217,No matter.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,218,I shall take back the North
S05E01,The Wars To Come,219,from the thieves who stole it.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,220,Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,221,I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,222,"But if I'm to take Winterfell, I need more men."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,223,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,224,I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,225,I'm talking about the wildlings.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,226,"Your Grace, you want the wildlings"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,227,to march in your army?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,228,"If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,229,"We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,230,I'll declare them citizens of the realm.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,231,I'll give them land to live on.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,232,It's a fair offer. More than fair.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,233,I'll offer them their lives and their freedom
S05E01,The Wars To Come,234,if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,235,I don't think that's likely.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,236,"You admire him, don't you?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,237,- I respect him. - He likes you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,238,- Convince him to bend the knee... - Your Grace.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,239,...or he burns.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,240,How much time do I have?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,241,Nightfall.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,242,The sun drops fast this time of year.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,243,"<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,244,<i>Shield up.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,245,"<i> Attack, my lord!</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,246,Attack!
S05E01,The Wars To Come,247,Don't cross your feet.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,248,My sons had swords in their hands
S05E01,The Wars To Come,249,from the time they could walk. This one...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,250,<i>Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,251,<i>Great warrior?</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,252,He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,253,My lord.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,254,"<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,255,Some boys develop more slowly.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,256,He's still young.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,257,He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,258,- He has other gifts. - Does he?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,259,The gift of a great name.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,260,Sometimes that's all one needs.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,261,"Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,262,"I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,263,"I have no doubt that on my return,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,264,Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,265,He'll be safe here.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,266,"<i>As for his skills,</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,267,I make no promises.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,268,Will we head north at some point?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,269,He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,270,We're a few days' ride from the Kingsroad.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,271,- But that will take us... - Us?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,272,The only reason you're here is because Jaime Lannister
S05E01,The Wars To Come,273,told me you weren't safe in the capital.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,274,You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,275,No one knows what you look like.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,276,No one cares. You're safe.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,277,- But I'm your squire. - Do you even know what a squire is?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,278,An attendant to a knight.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,279,I'm not a knight.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,280,That means you're not a squire.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,281,"Well, where would I go?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,282,I don't care. I'm not your mother.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,283,You swore to find the Stark girls.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,284,I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,285,- <i> Sansa still might.</i> - Will you shut your mouth?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,286,I didn't ask for your advice.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,287,I don't want anyone following me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,288,I'm not a leader.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,289,All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,290,The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,291,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,292,I did.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,293,- But we're heading west. - We are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,294,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,295,"Lord Royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,296,but he's not alone in that castle.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,297,"Do you trust all those knights and ladies,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,298,<i>stable boys and serving girls?</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,299,"No, do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,300,No.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,301,But I pay them well
S05E01,The Wars To Come,302,and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,303,So where are we going?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,304,To a land where you trust everyone?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,305,"To a land so far from here,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,306,even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,307,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,308,Your father was a...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,309,A force to be reckoned with.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,310,He truly was.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,311,I wouldn't presume to claim
S05E01,The Wars To Come,312,"to have known him as such, but..."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,313,<i>But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,314,just how formidable a person you were dealing with.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,315,What a... what a force to be reckoned with.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,316,Thank you so much for your kind words.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,317,"Deepest condolences, Your Grace."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,318,This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,319,I often warned...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,320,Your Grace.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,321,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,322,My deepest sympathies.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,323,I apologize for my son's appearance.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,324,"Uncle, it's quite all right."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,325,They call themselves sparrows.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,326,Bloody fanatics.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,327,"Religion has its place, of course,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,328,but at a certain point...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,329,They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,330,"I'm sure he'll grow out of it,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,331,whatever it is.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,332,- Excuse me. - Of course.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,333,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,334,It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,335,What can I do for you?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,336,You can forgive me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,337,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,338,I led you into the darkness.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,339,I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,340,I tempted you into our...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,341,unnatural relations.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,342,"And, of course, there was the king..."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,343,his boar hunt.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,344,His wine.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,345,I don't know what you're talking about.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,346,I'm a different person now.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,347,I've found peace in the light of the Seven.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,348,"<i>You can, too.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,349,"<i>They watch over all of us,</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,350,ready to dole out mercy
S05E01,The Wars To Come,351,or justice.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,352,Their world is at hand.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,353,I will pray for your father's soul.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,354,The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,355,- It looks like Dorne. - It doesn't.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,356,It does.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,357,That's the... That's the Sunspear bit right there.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,358,And that's where the mountains are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,359,And over here is...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,360,Is Sunsnake?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,361,Stonespear?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,362,Sandstone.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,363,Yes.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,364,"Yes, Sandstone."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,365,Just there.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,366,Fine.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,367,It's Dorne.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,368,We should go there.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,369,"I think we would have a lovely time,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,370,judging by my experience.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,371,"That would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,372,Anywhere but here.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,373,We're late for dinner as it is.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,374,You're very respectful.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,375,I'm very hungry.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,376,What's your name?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,377,"Olyvar, my lady."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,378,I'm afraid my brother
S05E01,The Wars To Come,379,"is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,380,My lady.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,381,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,382,Why?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,383,They all know about me anyway.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,384,Everybody knows everything about everyone.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,385,What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,386,"In any event, you shouldn't keep your intended waiting."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,387,My intended? Please.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,388,<i>Tywin's dead.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,389,<i>That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,390,- Lucky you. - Unlucky you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,391,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,392,"If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,393,Which means she stays in King's Landing.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,394,<i>Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,395,Perhaps.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,396,Perhaps?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,397,Perhaps.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,398,"Eunuch, the Spider, the Master of Whisperers."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,399,"Imp, Half-man."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,400,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,401,Not for a coward.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,402,"You are many things, my friend,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,403,but not a coward.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,404,You never told me why you set me free.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,405,Your brother asked me to.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,406,Could have said no.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,407,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,408,Not as dangerous as releasing me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,409,"You risked your life, your position, everything."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,410,Why? You're not family. You owe me nothing.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,411,I didn't do it for you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,412,I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,413,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,414,I don't believe in saviors.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,415,I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,416,You're going to have to find another soldier.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,417,I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,418,"You have many admirable qualities,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,419,self-pity is not one of them.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,420,Any fool with a bit of luck
S05E01,The Wars To Come,421,can find himself born into power.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,422,"But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,423,I'm not well-suited for work.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,424,I think you are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,425,You have your father's instincts for politics.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,426,And you have compassion.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,427,Compassion? Yes.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,428,I killed my lover with my bare hands.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,429,I shot my own father with a crossbow.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,430,I never said you were perfect.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,431,What is it you want exactly?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,432,Peace.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,433,Prosperity.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,434,A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,435,Where the castles are made of gingerbread
S05E01,The Wars To Come,436,and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,437,The powerful have always preyed on the powerless.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,438,That's how they became powerful in the first place.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,439,Perhaps.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,440,"And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,441,we assume there's no other way.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,442,"<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,443,<i>would you spread misery throughout the land?</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,444,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,445,"<i>No, you won't.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,446,<i>But you could help another climb those steps</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,447,and take that seat.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,448,"The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,449,but gentler than Stannis.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,450,A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,451,A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army
S05E01,The Wars To Come,452,and the right family name.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,453,Good luck finding him.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,454,"Who said anything about ""him""?"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,455,"You have a choice, my friend."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,456,You can stay here at Illyrio's palace
S05E01,The Wars To Come,457,"and drink yourself to death,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,458,"or you can ride with me to Meereen,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,459,"meet Daenerys Targaryen,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,460,and decide if the world is worth fighting for.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,461,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,462,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,463,Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,464,Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,465,The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power
S05E01,The Wars To Come,466,to a council of elders made up of both
S05E01,The Wars To Come,467,the freed men and the former slaveholders.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,468,All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,469,Good.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,470,They did ask for some concessions.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,471,Concessions?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,472,"Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,473,I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,474,"<i>Forgive me. You're right, of course.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,475,"Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,476,I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,477,Slavery made them rich. I ended slavery.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,478,They do not ask for the return of slavery.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,479,They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,480,The fighting pits?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,481,Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,482,"In the new world that you've brought to us,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,483,free men would fight free men.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,484,<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,485,<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,486,Bring some here and ask them yourself.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,487,No fighting pits.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,488,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai
S05E01,The Wars To Come,489,and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,490,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,491,If you... - How many times must I say no before you understand?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,492,"Whatever he wants from me, he's not going to get it."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,493,If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...
S05E01,The Wars To Come,494,You should reopen the fighting pits.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,495,What?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,496,My mother was a whore. I told you that.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,497,She liked to drink pear brandy.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,498,"The older she got, the less she made selling her body,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,499,the more she wanted to drink.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,500,"So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,501,she fucked the night before.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,502,I'm sorry.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,503,Why? I was a bad child.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,504,"I wasn't big, but I was quick."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,505,And I loved to fight.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,506,So they sold me to a man in Tolos
S05E01,The Wars To Come,507,who trained fighters for the pits.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,508,I had my first match when I was 16.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,509,"You were sold into slavery,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,510,"forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,511,and you're defending the fighting pits?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,512,I'm only here because of those pits.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,513,"I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,514,"a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,515,Soon I was famous.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,516,"10,000 men and women screamed my name"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,517,when I stepped into the pit.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,518,"I made so much money for my master,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,519,he set me free when he died.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,520,I joined the Second Sons.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,521,And then I met you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,522,You're the queen.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,523,Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,524,Everyone but me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,525,You've made thousands of enemies all across the world.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,526,"As soon as they see weakness,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,527,they'll attack.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,528,"Show your strength here, now."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,529,That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,530,Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,531,You're not the Mother of Unsullied.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,532,You're the Mother of Dragons.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,533,I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,534,No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,535,"For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,536,I can't control them anymore.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,537,A dragon queen with no dragons
S05E01,The Wars To Come,538,is not a queen.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,539,Viserion?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,540,Rhaegal?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,541,Easy. Easy.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,542,Easy.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,543,So here we are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,544,Here we are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,545,"When we first met, you were my prisoner."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,546,"And now, for our last meeting..."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,547,This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,548,"No, but it will be."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,549,You know what Stannis wants?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,550,He wants me to bend the knee.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,551,And he wants the free folk to fight for him.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,552,"I'll give him this much,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,553,he's bold.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,554,Shouldn't a king be bold?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,555,"<i>Oh, aye.</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,556,I respect him.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,557,"If he gets what he wants,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,558,I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools
S05E01,The Wars To Come,559,sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,560,But I'll never serve him.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,561,You told me you weren't here to conquer.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,562,You told me your people have bled enough.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,563,That's right.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,564,I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,565,You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together
S05E01,The Wars To Come,566,for the first time in history.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,567,"Thenns and Hornfoots,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,568,"the ice-river clans, even the giants."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,569,A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,570,You didn't do it for glory.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,571,You brought them together to save them
S05E01,The Wars To Come,572,"<i>because none of them will survive the winter,</i>"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,573,<i>not if they're north of the Wall.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,574,Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,575,Pride?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,576,Fuck my pride.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,577,This isn't about that.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,578,Then bend the knee and save your people.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,579,They followed me because they respected me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,580,Because they believed in me.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,581,"The moment I kneel for a southern king, that's all gone."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,582,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,583,How many women? How many children?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,584,And you won't go out and rescue them because why?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,585,You're afraid of looking afraid.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,586,"Oh, I am afraid."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,587,No shame in that.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,588,How will they do it? Beheading?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,589,Hanging?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,590,They'll burn you alive.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,591,Bad way to go.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,592,I'll be honest with you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,593,I don't want to die.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,594,"And burnt to death,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,595,"I don't want people to remember me like that,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,596,scorched and screaming.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,597,But it's better than betraying
S05E01,The Wars To Come,598,everything I believe.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,599,And what happens to your people?
S05E01,The Wars To Come,600,You preserve your dignity and die standing
S05E01,The Wars To Come,601,and they'll sing songs about you.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,602,You'd rather burn than kneel.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,603,The great hero.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,604,Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all
S05E01,The Wars To Come,605,and there's no one left to sing.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,606,You're a good lad.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,607,Truly you are.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,608,But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people
S05E01,The Wars To Come,609,"in a foreigner's war,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,610,there's no point explaining.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,611,I think you're making a terrible mistake.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,612,The freedom to make my own mistakes
S05E01,The Wars To Come,613,was all I ever wanted.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,614,"Mance Rayder, you've been called the King-beyond-the-Wall."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,615,Westeros only has one king.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,616,"Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,617,Kneel and live.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,618,This was my home for many years.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,619,I wish you good fortune
S05E01,The Wars To Come,620,in the wars to come.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,621,We all must choose.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,622,"Man or woman, young or old,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,623,"lord or peasant, our choices are the same."
S05E01,The Wars To Come,624,We choose light or we choose darkness.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,625,<i>We choose good or we choose evil.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,626,We choose the true god or the false.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,627,"Free folk,"
S05E01,The Wars To Come,628,<i>there is only one true king</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,629,<i>and his name is Stannis.</i>
S05E01,The Wars To Come,630,Here stands your king of lies.
S05E01,The Wars To Come,631,Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,3,"In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,4,the Titan would step with fire in his eyes.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,5,He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,6,He's just a statue.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,7,Don't be afraid.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,8,He's announcing our arrival.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,9,I'm not afraid.

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,19,Um...
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,20,Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,21,No one here by that name.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,22,Please.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,23,I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,24,You have everywhere else to go.

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,50,"My mother used to say, ""Dark wings, dark words."""
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,51,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,52,Excuse me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,53,So it was good news?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,54,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,55,I thought you still mourned the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,60,Sansa Stark. Don't look.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,61,You sure?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,62,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,63,She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,64,Littlefinger?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,65,A bunch of knights with him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,66,"A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick? Six? 20?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,67,"10, I think. Too many."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,68,"My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,69,- Ready the horses. - We only have one horse.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,70,Find more.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,71,Do you like the taste?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,72,I don't see what all the fuss is about.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,73,Why do men love it so much?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,74,It gives some men courage.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,75,Does it give you courage?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,76,That's far enough.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,77,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,78,My name is Brienne of Tarth.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,79,We've met with Renly Baratheon.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,80,<i>What did he say about you?</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,81,"He said, ""Your loyalty came free of charge."""
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,82,Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,84,"before your mother's death,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,85,I was her sworn sword.

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,87,I will shield your back and keep your counsel

S05E02,The House Of Black And White,91,no need for such formality.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,92,You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,93,- I was. - Strange.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,94,<i>I knew Cat from the time</i> <i>we were children.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,95,She never mentioned you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,96,It was after Renly's murder.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,97,"Ah, yes."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,98,You were accused of killing him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,99,- I tried to save him. - But you were accused.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,100,By men who didn't see what happened.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,101,And what did happen?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,102,He was murdered by a shadow.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,103,A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,104,A shadow?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,105,With the face--
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,106,<i>This woman swore</i> <i>to protect Renly.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,107,<i>She failed.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,108,She swore to protect your mother. She failed.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,109,Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,110,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,111,Because I am her uncle.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,112,I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,113,We're family now and you are an outsider.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,114,"Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experience has made me wary of outsiders."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,115,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,116,No.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,117,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,118,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,119,Neither of us wanted to be there.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,120,Sometimes we don't have a choice.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,121,And sometimes we do.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,122,<i>You should leave.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,123,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,124,The roads in these parts aren't safe.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,125,Why don't you stay?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,126,The man asked you to stay--
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,127,Hyah! Hyah!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,128,Hyah! Hyah!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,129,After her!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,130,- Yah! Hah! - Oh!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,131,- Stop! Stop! - I'll take him!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,132,Podrick!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,133,Hold on to her!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,134,Take her!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,135,<i>Keep moving!</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,136,Stop! Stop! Stop!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,137,Stop! Stop!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,138,That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,139,"No, no, no, stop!"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,140,I guess that means you're unarmed.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,141,"Down, Podrick! Down!"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,142,"- Podrick. - Yes, my lady?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,143,You can stand now.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,144,"Yes, my lady."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,145,Sansa Stark?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,146,"Wary of strangers, as she should be."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,147,I saw her riding on the East Road with Littlefinger.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,148,We'll follow them.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,149,"My lady, if both Stark girls refused your service,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,150,maybe you're released from your vow.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,151,I swore to their mother I would protect those girls.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,152,But if they don't want your protection--
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,153,Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,154,"No, my lady."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,155,Get your horse.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,156,A summons from the queen.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,157,There are only two like it in the world.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,158,"The one I'm wearing, the one I gave to Myrcella."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,159,- It's a threat. - Of course it's a threat.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,160,Our daughter's alone in Dorne
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,161,surrounded by people who hate our family.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,162,"""It's a threat."""
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,163,No note?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,164,They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,165,and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,166,I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,167,- Softer. - What?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,168,Not so loud.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,169,Our daughter's in danger and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,170,The world can't know she's our daughter.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,171,Then don't call her your daughter.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,172,You've never been a father to her.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,173,"If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the street."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,174,And what has your caution brought?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,175,Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,176,Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,177,Our baby boy set to marry
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,178,that smirking whore from Highgarden.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,179,I'm going to make things better.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,180,You've never made anything better.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,181,I'm going to Dorne
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,182,and I'm bringing our daughter home.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,183,You can't just ask Prince Doran
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,184,to give her back.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,185,She's promised to his son.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,186,I'm not going to ask him anything.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,187,"You go down there with an army, it's an act of war."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,188,No army.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,189,Do you know where they're keeping her?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,190,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,191,I'll find her.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,192,"Is there anything else, Your Grace?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,193,You're going to Dorne?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,194,A one-handed man alone?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,195,I never said I was going alone.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,196,No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,197,Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,198,And music. I adore music.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,199,But no flutes. I hate flutes.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,200,"We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,201,Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,202,Don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,203,"That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,204,Don't they?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,205,Don't who?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,206,People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,207,"They certainly do, my dear."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,208,They certainly do.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,209,"It's a fine place, isn't it?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,210,A fine place.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,211,I never thought I'd end up
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,212,settling down in a place like this.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,213,- You won't. - Pardon?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,214,We won't get to live at Stokeworth.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,215,"When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,216,- Oh. - She hates me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,217,She calls me mean names and sometimes even still
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,218,she pulls my hair when Mother's not looking.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,219,You know what I think?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,220,I think you're a good person.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,221,And your sister is a mean person.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,222,She is.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,223,"I've been all over the world,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,224,"and if there's one thing I've learned,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,225,it's that meanness comes around.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,226,"People like your sister,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,227,they always get what's coming to them eventually.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,228,One way or another.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,229,Who's that?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,230,Jaime fucking Lannister.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,231,- Ser Jaime. - Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,232,I was very sorry to hear about your father.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,233,Thank you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,234,This is my betrothed Lollys.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,235,A pleasure.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,236,"Run along, love."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,237,Beautiful young bride you've chosen.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,238,When were you planning on getting married?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,239,- Just get on with it. - On with what?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,240,What you're here for.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,241,There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,242,It's very good for you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,243,Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,244,Mmm.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,245,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,246,- I would have advised against that. - How is this good for me?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,247,'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,248,"And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,249,and a much better castle.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,250,Return from where?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,251,As far south as south goes.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,252,<i>My future queen.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,253,The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,254,Remove yourself from my path
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,255,or I'll take that longaxe and I'll shove it--
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,256,<i>Captain.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,257,<i>Let her pass.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,258,Your brother was murdered
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,259,and you sit here in the Water Gardens
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,260,staring at the sky and doing nothing.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,261,Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,262,"By law, that is not murder."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,263,- Your brother. - You don't have to remind me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,264,He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,265,What will you do about his death?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,266,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,267,- And then? - You would have me go to war?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,268,The whole country would have you go to war.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,269,Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,270,The Sand Snakes are with me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,271,They have the love of their people.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,272,They will avenge their father while you sit here
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,273,in your chair doing nothing.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,274,Oberyn is dead
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,275,<i>and this Lannister girl skips</i> <i>about the Water Gardens</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,276,"eating our food, breathing our air."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,277,How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,278,Let me have her.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,279,Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,280,I loved my brother.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,281,And you made him very happy.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,282,"For that, you will always have a place in my heart."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,283,But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,284,Not here.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,285,Not while I rule.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,286,And how long will that be?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,287,The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,288,Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,289,Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,290,"You haven't, have you?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,291,"My Second Sons, on the other hand,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,292,"they drink, they whore,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,293,"fight in the streets,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,294,they blend in.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,295,"They overhear things in taverns,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,296,"follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,297,"break a few fingers,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,298,overhear a few more things.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,299,Before you know it...
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,300,No one here.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,301,We go.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,302,In a hurry? You're afraid?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,303,Unsullied fear nothing.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,304,Right.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,305,That's your problem.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,306,"You understood fear once long ago,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,307,but you've forgotten what it means.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,308,Someone who's forgotten fear
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,309,has forgotten how to hide.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,310,Fear is useful that way.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,311,"Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,312,On all of our necks.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,313,"Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,314,It would send a message.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,315,"I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,316,"- Why? - For one thing, he may have valuable information."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,317,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,318,How do you know that?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,319,Because I questioned him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,320,"And the information you did get,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,321,- he is young and poor. - He is born free.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,322,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,323,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,324,was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,325,They pay him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,326,Great families afraid to do a thing.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,327,They pay poor man to do it for them.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,328,- And how do you know this? - Everyone know this.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,329,I don't know it and I'm the head of a great family.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,330,<i>We do not know what this man did or didn't do.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,331,Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,332,Show all the citizens of Meereen
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,333,that you're better than those who would depose you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,334,Teach them a better way.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,335,I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,336,"Things maybe are different there, I hope."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,337,"But here in Meereen,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,338,"before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,339,So we learn much about them
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,340,or we do not live long.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,341,They teach me what they are.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,342,"Mercy, fair trial-- these mean nothing to them."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,343,All they understand is blood.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,344,<i>Thank you all for your counsel.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,345,"Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,346,- About what? - About your father.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,347,- About the Mad King. - The Mad King?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,348,You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,349,Consider me reminded.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,350,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,351,I was at his side from the first.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,352,Your enemies did not lie.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,353,Go on.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,354,"When the people rose in revolt against him,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,355,your father set their towns and castles aflame.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,356,He murdered sons in front of their fathers.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,357,He burned men alive with wildfire
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,358,and laughed as they screamed.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,359,<i>And his efforts</i> <i>to stamp out dissent</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,360,led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,361,I'm not my father.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,362,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,363,But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,364,"And each time, it made him feel powerful and right."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,365,Until the very end.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,366,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,367,without a fair trial.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,368,Your Grace.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,369,There's a bug.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,370,"Yes, best be careful."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,371,You might accidently consume some solid food.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,372,"When I agreed to come with you,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,373,did I misrepresent my intentions?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,374,"Besides, what else is there for me to do"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,375,inside this fucking box?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,376,- You don't like it? - I want to take a walk.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,377,<i>You can't.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,378,Cersei has offered a lordship
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,379,to the man who brings her your head.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,380,She ought to offer her cunt.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,381,Best part of her for the best part of me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,382,"Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,383,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,384,talking about the futility of everything?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,385,You're right. No point.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,386,<i>The road to Volantis?</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,387,You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,388,The road to Meereen.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,389,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,390,I told you. A ruler.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,391,We've already got a ruler.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,392,Everywhere has already got a ruler.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,393,Every pile of shit on the side of every road
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,394,has someone's banner hanging from it.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,395,"You were quite good, you know, at ruling."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,396,During your brief tenure as Hand.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,397,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,398,"Still, a man of talent."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,399,Managed to kill a lot of people.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,400,"Yes, but you showed great promise in other areas as well."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,401,She wanted me to leave King's Landing.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,402,She begged me.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,403,I wouldn't go.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,404,Why?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,405,'Cause I liked it.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,406,Power. Even as a servant.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,407,People follow leaders.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,408,And they will never follow us.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,409,They find us repulsive.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,410,I find us repulsive.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,411,"And we find them repulsive,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,412,"which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,413,to keep them away.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,414,"And yet,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,415,"no matter what we do,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,416,people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,417,<i>Not for long.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,418,You're right.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,419,- Let's go for a walk. - No.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,420,How many dwarves are there in the world?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,421,Is Cersei going to kill them all?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,422,Not him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,423,Are you trying to deceive your queen?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,424,"Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,425,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,426,I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,427,Mistakes will be made.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,428,"- Thank you, Your Grace, thank you. - Your Grace, thank you."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,429,"- Take the head. - Pardon me, Your Grace."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,430,I would take it if you don't mind.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,431,It could prove useful for my work.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,432,Very good.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,433,Over there will be fine.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,434,You heard the man. Over there.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,435,You're the Hand of the King?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,436,"No, Uncle."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,437,Clearly it would not be appropriate
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,438,for a woman to assume that role.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,439,I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,440,and chooses a Hand for himself.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,441,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,442,as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,443,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,444,but I don't imagine you'll have the time.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,445,"In addition to being Master of Ships,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,446,the king has appointed you Master of Coin.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,447,"Oh, Your Grace."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,448,He called your experience and wisdom
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,449,in financial matters unparalleled.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,450,He said he would be honored to have you
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,451,represent the crown's interests in the same.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,452,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,453,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,454,a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,455,The king has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,456,"Your Grace, him? This-- this man?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,457,This embarrassment to the Citadel?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,458,"Your Grace, what qualifications"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,459,can he possibly have for this post?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,460,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,461,That's far more than the eunuch ever had.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,462,Far more than many ever have.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,463,"I must say, I cannot see--"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,464,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,465,"as commander of the Lannister armies,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,466,it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,467,No man living better deserves the title.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,468,That is kind of you to say.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,469,I would like to hear it from the king himself.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,470,The king is very busy at this moment.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,471,He should be here learning what it means to rule.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,472,He is learning.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,473,"On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,474,he's asked me to speak on his behalf.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,475,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,476,And to you. And to serve the king.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,477,I did not return to the capital
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,478,to serve as your puppet.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,479,To watch you stack the small council with sycophants.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,480,Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,481,My brother has left the capital to lead
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,482,a sensitive diplomatic mission.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,483,What mission?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,484,That is not your concern as Master of War.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,485,I do not recognize your authority
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,486,to dictate what is and is not my concern.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,487,"You are the Queen Mother, nothing more."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,488,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,489,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,490,At Casterly Rock.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,491,"<i>Come on, you know this one.</i>"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,492,<i>It looks like an animal.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,493,Snake.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,494,Sssnake. S.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,495,"- It's an S. - Right, very good."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,496,Huh!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,497,Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,498,Osric Stark was elected at the age of 10?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,499,I know S.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,500,"You'll learn, I promise."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,501,"I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,502,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,503,Very patient.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,504,"I only said that the more time that you spend practicing,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,505,<i>the faster</i> <i>you'll be able to read.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,506,That's all right. We're doing just fine.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,507,"I'm sure you and ""Ostrich"" Stark"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,508,have a lot to talk about.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,509,How old were you when you learned how to read?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,510,- Three. - Three?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,511,"Who taught you, your mother?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,512,"No, old Maester Cressen did."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,513,I had a lot of time to practice.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,514,My mother kept me inside because...
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,515,"What do you call it in the south,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,516,what happened to your face?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,517,Greyscale.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,518,What do you call it north of the Wall?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,519,I don't know.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,520,But two of my sisters had it.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,521,They both died.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,522,How did they cure you?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,523,I don't remember.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,524,I was a baby.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,525,"Lots of people came and tried, I think."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,526,"Whatever they did, it went away."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,527,What happened to your sisters?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,528,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,529,None of us were allowed to go near them.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,530,"But we heard them, especially at night."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,531,They started to sound not like themselves.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,532,Did you ever see them?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,533,Only once at the end.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,534,They were covered with it.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,535,"Their faces, their arms."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,536,They acted like animals.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,537,My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,538,What did he do with them in the woods?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,539,Mother.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,540,Leave us.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,541,Your Grace.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,542,You need to stay away from that girl.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,543,- Why? - She's a wildling.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,544,Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,545,I'm teaching her to read.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,546,She's a wildling.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,547,Your father defeated her people.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,548,He executed their king for treason.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,549,They could strike at him by striking at you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,550,Gilly wouldn't do that.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,551,You have no idea what people will do.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,552,All your books and you still don't know.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,553,<i>I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,554,<i>You prevented that order</i> <i>from being carried out.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,555,<i>You showed mercy</i> <i>to Mance Rayder.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,556,A king's word is law.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,557,Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,558,<i>I show to lawbreakers.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,559,"Show too much kindness, people won't fear you."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,560,"If they don't fear you, they don't follow you."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,561,"With respect, Your Grace,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,562,the free folk will never follow you no matter what you do.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,563,You're the man who burned their king alive.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,564,"Who, then?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,565,You?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,566,No.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,567,Only one of their own.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,568,"Do you know this wretched girl,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,569,Lyanna Mormont?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,570,The Lord Commander's niece.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,571,Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,572,I asked her to commit her house to my cause. That's her response.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,573,"""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,574,"whose name is Stark."""
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,575,That amuses you?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,576,"I apologize, Your Grace."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,577,Northerners can be a bit like the free folk.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,578,- Loyal to their own. <i>- I know.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,579,My brother Robert went on often and loudly
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,580,about how difficult it was to control them.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,581,Even with your father's help.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,582,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,583,Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,584,- Most likely. - Unpleasant man.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,585,He thinks you're a traitor.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,586,What's your life going to be like here at the Wall with Thorne in command?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,587,"Unpleasant, I expect."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,588,Your bravery made him look weak.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,589,He'll punish you for it.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,590,I don't punish men for bravery.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,591,<i>I reward them.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,592,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,593,But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,594,"<i>I pledged them my life,</i> <i>my honor, my sword.</i>"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,595,I don't know what I have left to give you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,596,You can give me the North.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,597,I can't.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,598,"Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,599,a Snow.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,600,Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,601,"Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,602,<i>Lord of Winterfell.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,603,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,604,It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,605,I'd daydream that my father would ask the king
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,606,"and just like that, I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,607,You deserve this. You do.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,608,I couldn't be happier for you.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,609,I'm going to refuse him.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,610,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,611,I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,612,"If I don't take my own word seriously,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,613,what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,614,Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,615,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,616,before we cast our tokens
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,617,for the 998th Lord Commander
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,618,of the Night's Watch?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,619,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,620,he's a man of true nobility.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,621,He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,622,"- and led us to victory against the wildlings. - Hear, hear."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,623,He's a veteran of 100 battles
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,624,and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,625,<i>Aye.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,626,He's the only true choice.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,627,Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,628,and has served loyally longer than any other ranger.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,629,Through 10 winters he served.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,630,"As commander of the Shadow Tower,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,631,he kept the wildlings away.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,632,<i>We could do no better.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,633,"<i>If there is no one else,</i>"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,634,<i>we will begin the voting.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,635,<i>The triangular tokens count</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,636,for Ser Alliser Thorne.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,637,The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,638,- <i>Each brother will--</i> <i>- Maester Aemon.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,639,Samwell Tarly. Go on.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,640,Sam the Slayer.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,641,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,642,"How's your lady love, Slayer?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,643,Her name is Gilly.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,644,<i>Brother Slynt</i> <i>knows her quite well.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,645,They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,646,Lies!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,647,"A wildling girl, a baby,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,648,and Lord Janos.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,649,I found him there after the battle was over
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,650,in a puddle of his own making.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,651,Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,652,"with the women and children,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,653,Jon Snow was leading.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,654,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,655,"And when he was wounded, it was Jon who saved us."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,656,He took charge of the Wall's defense.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,657,He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,658,He went north to deal with Mance Rayder
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,659,knowing it almost certainly meant his own death.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,660,"Before that,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,661,he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,662,Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,663,"He saw something in Jon and now we've all seen it, too."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,664,"He may be young,"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,665,but he's the commander we turned to
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,666,when the night was darkest.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,667,I can't argue with any of that.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,668,But who does Jon Snow want to command?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,669,Night's Watch
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,670,or the wildlings?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,671,<i>Everyone knows he loved</i> <i>a wildling girl</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,672,<i>and spoke with</i> <i>Mance Rayder many times.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,673,What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,674,if Stannis's army hadn't come along?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,675,We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,676,<i>Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,677,or a man who makes love to them?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,678,It is time.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,679,"It appears to be a tie, Maester."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,680,Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,681,You. You.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,682,What have you got there?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,683,- I said-- - Turn around and go.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,684,Turn around and go.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,685,That's a nice little sword.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,686,"Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that."
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,687,Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,688,<i>Come on.</i>
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,689,"Quickly, go! Go!"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,690,Who are you?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,691,Why were they scared of you?
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,692,You lost this.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,693,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,694,There isn't.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,695,A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,696,"Well, who are you, then?"
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,697,No one.
S05E02,The House Of Black And White,698,And that is who a girl must become.

S05E03,High Sparrow,5,Good.
S05E03,High Sparrow,6,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
S05E03,High Sparrow,7,No?
S05E03,High Sparrow,8,"Why come, then?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,9,You said I could be your apprentice.
S05E03,High Sparrow,10,You said you'd teach me how to be a Faceless Man.
S05E03,High Sparrow,11,A man teaches a girl.
S05E03,High Sparrow,12,Valar dohaeris.
S05E03,High Sparrow,13,All men must serve.
S05E03,High Sparrow,14,Faceless Men most of all.
S05E03,High Sparrow,15,I want to serve.
S05E03,High Sparrow,16,A girl wants to serve herself.
S05E03,High Sparrow,17,Here we serve the Many-Faced God.
S05E03,High Sparrow,18,"To serve well,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,19,a girl must become no one.
S05E03,High Sparrow,20,Which one's the Many-Faced God?
S05E03,High Sparrow,21,I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God.
S05E03,High Sparrow,22,I see the weirwood face.
S05E03,High Sparrow,23,There is only one god.
S05E03,High Sparrow,24,A girl knows his name.
S05E03,High Sparrow,25,And all men know his gift.
S05E03,High Sparrow,26,Where are they taking him?
S05E03,High Sparrow,27,Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
S05E03,High Sparrow,28,<i>Queen Margaery!</i>

S05E03,High Sparrow,30,<i>Queen Margaery!</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,31,- <i> I am his and he is mine.</i> - <i> I am hers and she is mine.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,32,<i>From this day until the end of my days.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,33,Did I hurt you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,34,No. You were lovely.
S05E03,High Sparrow,35,- It all happened so fast. - Yes.
S05E03,High Sparrow,36,I was scared maybe I hurt you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,37,"- It sounded like-- - No, no, no."
S05E03,High Sparrow,38,You're very sweet.
S05E03,High Sparrow,39,The sweetest king who ever lived.
S05E03,High Sparrow,40,"This is all I want to do all day,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,41,"every day, for the rest of my life."
S05E03,High Sparrow,42,Wouldn't that be glorious?
S05E03,High Sparrow,43,Shouldn't we rest a little while?
S05E03,High Sparrow,44,"Just to catch our breath? There's no rush, is there?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,45,Of course not.
S05E03,High Sparrow,46,Are you hungry?
S05E03,High Sparrow,47,Should I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
S05E03,High Sparrow,48,"No, I'm fine."
S05E03,High Sparrow,49,I just want you all to myself.
S05E03,High Sparrow,50,I want to know everything there is to know
S05E03,High Sparrow,51,"about King Tommen, First of His Name."
S05E03,High Sparrow,52,King Tommen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,53,Still sounds strange to me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,54,Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,55,So strange.
S05E03,High Sparrow,56,- Husband. - Wife.
S05E03,High Sparrow,57,Sometimes it feels odd.
S05E03,High Sparrow,58,"I'm the king,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,59,"I've married the most beautiful woman in the world,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,60,and it's all because my brother died.
S05E03,High Sparrow,61,I understand.
S05E03,High Sparrow,62,"But it's not your fault. You know that, don't you?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,63,You mustn't feel guilty.
S05E03,High Sparrow,64,I don't feel guilty.
S05E03,High Sparrow,65,That's what's odd.
S05E03,High Sparrow,66,Do you like to sail?
S05E03,High Sparrow,67,I love to sail.
S05E03,High Sparrow,68,"I do, too."
S05E03,High Sparrow,69,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
S05E03,High Sparrow,70,"I do, too."
S05E03,High Sparrow,71,Living in a tower so high itches the clouds.
S05E03,High Sparrow,72,"Of course, my grandmother couldn't wait to go home."
S05E03,High Sparrow,73,"The capital's not for everyone, I suppose."
S05E03,High Sparrow,74,Does your mother like it here?
S05E03,High Sparrow,75,I don't think so.
S05E03,High Sparrow,76,She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
S05E03,High Sparrow,77,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,78,A lioness guarding her cub.
S05E03,High Sparrow,79,"Well, but I'm a man now."
S05E03,High Sparrow,80,You are.
S05E03,High Sparrow,81,And the king.
S05E03,High Sparrow,82,But you'll always be her baby boy.
S05E03,High Sparrow,83,- I suppose. - <i> I adore her.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,84,"She's always been so generous with me, so kind."
S05E03,High Sparrow,85,And the horrors she's had to endure--
S05E03,High Sparrow,86,"losing her husband, her eldest child, and her father."
S05E03,High Sparrow,87,It's no wonder she's so protective of you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,88,She'll never let you out of her sight.
S05E03,High Sparrow,89,You look very much in love.
S05E03,High Sparrow,90,The first days of marriage are often so blissful.
S05E03,High Sparrow,91,"She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,92,Like a doll.
S05E03,High Sparrow,93,She smiles quite a lot.
S05E03,High Sparrow,94,Do you think she's intelligent?
S05E03,High Sparrow,95,I can't quite tell.
S05E03,High Sparrow,96,Not that it mas.
S05E03,High Sparrow,97,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
S05E03,High Sparrow,98,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
S05E03,High Sparrow,99,That's where you grew up.
S05E03,High Sparrow,100,You always told me that you liked the people there better.
S05E03,High Sparrow,101,You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
S05E03,High Sparrow,102,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
S05E03,High Sparrow,103,"The way that you talked about it,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,104,"I always thought that you missed it,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,105,that you-- that it was your real home.
S05E03,High Sparrow,106,"This is my real home now, where my family lives."
S05E03,High Sparrow,107,"I want you to be happy, Mother."
S05E03,High Sparrow,108,I know that.
S05E03,High Sparrow,109,I know you do.
S05E03,High Sparrow,110,My sweet boy.
S05E03,High Sparrow,111,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
S05E03,High Sparrow,112,"<i>I said, ""Darling, surely four times is enough.""</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,113,"<i> ""Are you trying to set a new record?""</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,114,"He said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
S05E03,High Sparrow,115,Mother.
S05E03,High Sparrow,116,Welcome.
S05E03,High Sparrow,117,Don't you look lovely?
S05E03,High Sparrow,118,Marriage agrees with you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,119,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?
S05E03,High Sparrow,120,I wish we had some wine for you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,121,It's a bit early in the day for us.
S05E03,High Sparrow,122,"No, no, I can't stay."
S05E03,High Sparrow,123,I just wanted to let you know
S05E03,High Sparrow,124,if there's ever anything I can do for you...
S05E03,High Sparrow,125,You are very sweet.
S05E03,High Sparrow,126,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,127,I absolutely adore him.
S05E03,High Sparrow,128,You raised a gallant young man.
S05E03,High Sparrow,129,I'm forever grateful.
S05E03,High Sparrow,130,Good.
S05E03,High Sparrow,131,Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
S05E03,High Sparrow,132,Ecstatic. I really am.
S05E03,High Sparrow,133,"Exhausted, to be honest."
S05E03,High Sparrow,134,"But what could I expect? He is half lion, half stag."
S05E03,High Sparrow,135,"I'll leave you to it, then."
S05E03,High Sparrow,136,"Oh, forgive me."
S05E03,High Sparrow,137,I haven't been at court for long.
S05E03,High Sparrow,138,I get so confused.
S05E03,High Sparrow,139,What's the proper way to address you now?
S05E03,High Sparrow,140,Queen Moth or Dowager Queen?
S05E03,High Sparrow,141,There's no need for such formalities.
S05E03,High Sparrow,142,"In any event, judging from the king's enthusiasm,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,143,the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.
S05E03,High Sparrow,144,Won't that be a lovely day?
S05E03,High Sparrow,145,Can you imagine the celebrations?
S05E03,High Sparrow,146,They'll ring the bells all day and night.
S05E03,High Sparrow,147,Remember...
S05E03,High Sparrow,148,anything you need.
S05E03,High Sparrow,149,<i>We can't hold the North with terror alone.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,150,<i> You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,151,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
S05E03,High Sparrow,152,<i>Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,153,Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark
S05E03,High Sparrow,154,and he'd be damned if he'd kiss a traitor's boot.
S05E03,High Sparrow,155,<i>He left you no choice.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,156,I flayed him living along with his wife and brother.
S05E03,High Sparrow,157,Made his son watch.
S05E03,High Sparrow,158,And?
S05E03,High Sparrow,159,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
S05E03,High Sparrow,160,I've something important to tell you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,161,Stop eating and listen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,162,We don't have enough men to hold the North
S05E03,High Sparrow,163,if the other houses rise up against us.
S05E03,High Sparrow,164,Do you understand that?
S05E03,High Sparrow,165,Our pact with the Lannisters protects--
S05E03,High Sparrow,166,I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.
S05E03,High Sparrow,167,And Tywin Lannister is dead.
S05E03,High Sparrow,168,The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.
S05E03,High Sparrow,169,<i>They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,170,sent their army this far north.
S05E03,High Sparrow,171,"If you think they will for us, you're a fool."
S05E03,High Sparrow,172,<i>We've become a great house</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,173,<i>by entering into alliances</i> <i>with other houses</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,174,and parlaying those alliances into greater power.
S05E03,High Sparrow,175,The best way to forge a lasting alliance
S05E03,High Sparrow,176,isn't by peeling a man's skin off.
S05E03,High Sparrow,177,The best way is marriage.
S05E03,High Sparrow,178,"Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,179,it's high time you married a suitable bride.
S05E03,High Sparrow,180,"And as it happens,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,181,I've found the perfect girl to solidify our hold on the North.
S05E03,High Sparrow,182,That's Moat Cailin.
S05E03,High Sparrow,183,"Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,184,You've been here before?
S05E03,High Sparrow,185,On our way down to King's Landing
S05E03,High Sparrow,186,with my father and Arya.
S05E03,High Sparrow,187,Where are you taking me?
S05E03,High Sparrow,188,Home.
S05E03,High Sparrow,189,The Boltons have Winterfell.
S05E03,High Sparrow,190,"Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you."
S05E03,High Sparrow,191,No.
S05E03,High Sparrow,192,Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
S05E03,High Sparrow,193,He betrayed my family.
S05E03,High Sparrow,194,He did.
S05E03,High Sparrow,195,He serves the Lannisters.
S05E03,High Sparrow,196,For now.
S05E03,High Sparrow,197,- I won't go. - Winterfell is your home.
S05E03,High Sparrow,198,- Not anymore. - Always.
S05E03,High Sparrow,199,You're a Stark. Dying your hair doesn't change that.
S05E03,High Sparrow,200,"You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark."
S05E03,High Sparrow,201,<i>Your place is in the North.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,202,I can't marry him. You can't make me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,203,He is a traitor. A murderer!
S05E03,High Sparrow,204,You're not marrying Roose Bolton.
S05E03,High Sparrow,205,"No, you'll be marrying his son and heir Ramsay."
S05E03,High Sparrow,206,One day he'll be Warden of the North and you--
S05E03,High Sparrow,207,- No. - Sansa.
S05E03,High Sparrow,208,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself."
S05E03,High Sparrow,209,I will die before I have to go there.
S05E03,High Sparrow,210,I won't force you to do anything.
S05E03,High Sparrow,211,Don't you know by now how much I care for you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,212,"Say the word and we turn the horses around,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,213,but listen to me. Listen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,214,You've been running all your life.
S05E03,High Sparrow,215,Terrible things happen to your family and you weep.
S05E03,High Sparrow,216,You sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates.
S05E03,High Sparrow,217,You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.
S05E03,High Sparrow,218,Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?
S05E03,High Sparrow,219,Stop running.
S05E03,High Sparrow,220,There's no justice in the world.
S05E03,High Sparrow,221,Not unless we make it.
S05E03,High Sparrow,222,You loved your family.
S05E03,High Sparrow,223,Avenge them.
S05E03,High Sparrow,224,<i>Banners!</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,225,How do we get through there?
S05E03,High Sparrow,226,We don't.
S05E03,High Sparrow,227,We go around.
S05E03,High Sparrow,228,Takes us miles out of the way.
S05E03,High Sparrow,229,We'll lose sight of them.
S05E03,High Sparrow,230,Doesn't matter.
S05E03,High Sparrow,231,I know where they're going.
S05E03,High Sparrow,232,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire?
S05E03,High Sparrow,233,How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
S05E03,High Sparrow,234,He hates that nickname.
S05E03,High Sparrow,235,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,236,I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
S05E03,High Sparrow,237,during the War of the Five Kings.
S05E03,High Sparrow,238,One night he had a bit too much to drink
S05E03,High Sparrow,239,"and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
S05E03,High Sparrow,240,He borrowed it?
S05E03,High Sparrow,241,He wasn't a thief.
S05E03,High Sparrow,242,He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking.
S05E03,High Sparrow,243,"<i>I was drunk, too.</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,244,He gave me half the ham.
S05E03,High Sparrow,245,"Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out"
S05E03,High Sparrow,246,<i>under a wagon with the hambone still in his hand.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,247,They hanged him that afternoon.
S05E03,High Sparrow,248,"They tied the noose for me, too,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,249,"<i>but Lord Tywin heard</i> <i>my family name was Payne,</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,250,so he pardoned me
S05E03,High Sparrow,251,and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.
S05E03,High Sparrow,252,As punishment for both of you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,253,It didn't seem that way.
S05E03,High Sparrow,254,Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,255,"Yes, all your lords have been very kind to you."
S05E03,High Sparrow,256,All except me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,257,Sorry you had to squire for such a nasty person.
S05E03,High Sparrow,258,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,259,You beat the Hound.
S05E03,High Sparrow,260,I'm proud to be your squire.
S05E03,High Sparrow,261,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,262,"If you didn't snap at me, I wouldn't learn anything."
S05E03,High Sparrow,263,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,264,Yes.
S05E03,High Sparrow,265,"<i>Starting tomorrow, we'll train with a sword twice a day.</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,266,Before we ride in the morning and after you make camp in the evening.
S05E03,High Sparrow,267,- And I'm going to show you how to ride properly. - Thank you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,268,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
S05E03,High Sparrow,269,I suppose that's more important.
S05E03,High Sparrow,270,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard"
S05E03,High Sparrow,271,"to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,272,I was.
S05E03,High Sparrow,273,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
S05E03,High Sparrow,274,He was.
S05E03,High Sparrow,275,How did you end up serving Renly?
S05E03,High Sparrow,276,"When I was a girl, my father held a ball."
S05E03,High Sparrow,277,"I'm his only living child, so he wanted to make a good match for me."
S05E03,High Sparrow,278,He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.
S05E03,High Sparrow,279,"I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom."
S05E03,High Sparrow,280,And it was wonderful.
S05E03,High Sparrow,281,None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was.
S05E03,High Sparrow,282,They shoved each other and threatened to duel
S05E03,High Sparrow,283,when they thought it was their turn to dance.
S05E03,High Sparrow,284,They whispered in my ear
S05E03,High Sparrow,285,how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles.
S05E03,High Sparrow,286,My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.
S05E03,High Sparrow,287,I had never been so happy.
S05E03,High Sparrow,288,Till I saw a few of the boys snickering.
S05E03,High Sparrow,289,And then they all started to laugh.
S05E03,High Sparrow,290,They couldn't keep the game going any longer.
S05E03,High Sparrow,291,They were toying with me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,292,"""Brienne the Beauty"" they called me."
S05E03,High Sparrow,293,Great joke.
S05E03,High Sparrow,294,And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.
S05E03,High Sparrow,295,A great lumbering beast.
S05E03,High Sparrow,296,"I tried to run away,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,297,but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.
S05E03,High Sparrow,298,"""Don't let them see your tears,"" he told me."
S05E03,High Sparrow,299,"""They're nasty little shits"
S05E03,High Sparrow,300,"and nasty little shits aren't worth crying over."""
S05E03,High Sparrow,301,He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.
S05E03,High Sparrow,302,Renly was the king's brother after all.
S05E03,High Sparrow,303,But wasn't he...?
S05E03,High Sparrow,304,Lord Tyrion said he was...
S05E03,High Sparrow,305,"Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot."
S05E03,High Sparrow,306,He didn't love me. He didn't want me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,307,He danced with me because he was kind
S05E03,High Sparrow,308,and didn't want to see me hurt.
S05E03,High Sparrow,309,He saved me from being a joke.
S05E03,High Sparrow,310,From that day until his last day.
S05E03,High Sparrow,311,And I couldn't save him in return.
S05E03,High Sparrow,312,Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.
S05E03,High Sparrow,313,One day I will avenge King Renly.
S05E03,High Sparrow,314,But you said a shadow murdered him.
S05E03,High Sparrow,315,How do you fight a shadow?
S05E03,High Sparrow,316,A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.
S05E03,High Sparrow,317,I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart.
S05E03,High Sparrow,318,"Stannis is a man, not a shadow."
S05E03,High Sparrow,319,And a man can be killed.
S05E03,High Sparrow,320,- Lord Commander. - Your Grace.
S05E03,High Sparrow,321,I'd like to speak alone.
S05E03,High Sparrow,322,Olly is my steward now
S05E03,High Sparrow,323,as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.
S05E03,High Sparrow,324,I want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience.
S05E03,High Sparrow,325,One day he might command.
S05E03,High Sparrow,326,Very well.
S05E03,High Sparrow,327,Have you considered my offer?
S05E03,High Sparrow,328,I have.
S05E03,High Sparrow,329,And I thank you for it. You do me great honor.
S05E03,High Sparrow,330,All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
S05E03,High Sparrow,331,Say the word and you will be.
S05E03,High Sparrow,332,But I have to refuse you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,333,I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S05E03,High Sparrow,334,My place is here.
S05E03,High Sparrow,335,"I'm giving you the chance to avenge your family,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,336,to take back the castle where you grew up.
S05E03,High Sparrow,337,To rule the North.
S05E03,High Sparrow,338,I wish I could fight beside you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,339,"Believe me, I do."
S05E03,High Sparrow,340,But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.
S05E03,High Sparrow,341,I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.
S05E03,High Sparrow,342,You're as stubborn as your father.
S05E03,High Sparrow,343,I can imagine no higher praise.
S05E03,High Sparrow,344,I didn't mean it as praise.
S05E03,High Sparrow,345,Honor got your father killed.
S05E03,High Sparrow,346,"But if your mind's made up, I won't try and dissuade you."
S05E03,High Sparrow,347,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,348,Are you bored of us already?
S05E03,High Sparrow,349,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
S05E03,High Sparrow,350,We will never forget that.
S05E03,High Sparrow,351,But it's a question of survival.
S05E03,High Sparrow,352,<i>The Night's Watch can't</i> <i>continue to feed your men</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,353,and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.
S05E03,High Sparrow,354,Winter is coming.
S05E03,High Sparrow,355,I know it.
S05E03,High Sparrow,356,"We march on Winterfell within the fortnight,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,357,before the snows trap us here.
S05E03,High Sparrow,358,And the wildlings?
S05E03,High Sparrow,359,"If they'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it."
S05E03,High Sparrow,360,I leave their fate to you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,361,You could execute them. That's the safest course.
S05E03,High Sparrow,362,Or you could see if this Tormund fellow
S05E03,High Sparrow,363,is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was.
S05E03,High Sparrow,364,I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
S05E03,High Sparrow,365,would rather see the wildlings dead.
S05E03,High Sparrow,366,"Most of the brothers, yes."
S05E03,High Sparrow,367,<i>There's little love</i> <i>for the free folk here.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,368,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
S05E03,High Sparrow,369,You have many enemies in Castle Black.
S05E03,High Sparrow,370,Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?
S05E03,High Sparrow,371,Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
S05E03,High Sparrow,372,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
S05E03,High Sparrow,373,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
S05E03,High Sparrow,374,<i>He sees something in you.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,375,"Might not be apparent from his tone,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,376,but it's the truth.
S05E03,High Sparrow,377,He believes in you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,378,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
S05E03,High Sparrow,379,"The king is a complicated man,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,380,but he wants to do what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E03,High Sparrow,381,As long as he's ruling them.
S05E03,High Sparrow,382,He's the one true king.
S05E03,High Sparrow,383,He has a blood right to that throne.
S05E03,High Sparrow,384,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E03,High Sparrow,385,Have you now?
S05E03,High Sparrow,386,How does the Night's Watch vow go again?
S05E03,High Sparrow,387,I'll bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
S05E03,High Sparrow,388,Night gathers and now my watch begins.
S05E03,High Sparrow,389,"No, not that bit. The bit at the end."
S05E03,High Sparrow,390,"I am the sword in the darkness,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,391,"the watcher on the walls,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,392,the shield that guards the realms of men.
S05E03,High Sparrow,393,"- <i> I pledge my life--</i> - Right, that's enough."
S05E03,High Sparrow,394,The shield that guards the realms of men.
S05E03,High Sparrow,395,That's what you swore to be.
S05E03,High Sparrow,396,"Now, I'm not a learned man,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,397,but the best way to help the most people might not be sitting
S05E03,High Sparrow,398,in a frozen castle at the edge of the world.
S05E03,High Sparrow,399,"It just might mean wading in the muck,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,400,getting your boots dirty
S05E03,High Sparrow,401,and doing what needs to be done.
S05E03,High Sparrow,402,And what needs to be done?
S05E03,High Sparrow,403,"As long as the Boltons rule the North,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,404,the North will suffer.
S05E03,High Sparrow,405,Just one man's opinion.
S05E03,High Sparrow,406,What do you want?
S05E03,High Sparrow,407,Who are you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,408,"- What? - You, who walk in here"
S05E03,High Sparrow,409,with a coin you never earned
S05E03,High Sparrow,410,whose value you do not respect.
S05E03,High Sparrow,411,Who are you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,412,No one.
S05E03,High Sparrow,413,Ow! Cunt!
S05E03,High Sparrow,414,A lie. A sad little lie. Who are you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,415,"I told you, I'm no--"
S05E03,High Sparrow,416,"Do that again, and--"
S05E03,High Sparrow,417,Who are you?
S05E03,High Sparrow,418,You're about to find out.
S05E03,High Sparrow,419,What are you doing?
S05E03,High Sparrow,420,We were only playing. The Game of Faces.
S05E03,High Sparrow,421,- A girl is not ready. - Clearly not.
S05E03,High Sparrow,422,I am ready!
S05E03,High Sparrow,423,For what?
S05E03,High Sparrow,424,For whatever you want.
S05E03,High Sparrow,425,To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
S05E03,High Sparrow,426,<i>Whose sword is that?</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,427,It belongs to Arya Stark.
S05E03,High Sparrow,428,"Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,429,Arya Stark's stolen silver.
S05E03,High Sparrow,430,A man wonders how is it that no one
S05E03,High Sparrow,431,came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things.
S05E03,High Sparrow,432,What do we do with them after we wash them?
S05E03,High Sparrow,433,<i>Open gate!</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,434,"<i>Honor guard, stand to!</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,435,<i>Hold up. Easy.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,436,Lady Sansa. Welcome.
S05E03,High Sparrow,437,Lord Bolton.
S05E03,High Sparrow,438,May I introduce my son Ramsay Bolton?
S05E03,High Sparrow,439,"It's an honor to meet you, my lady."
S05E03,High Sparrow,440,I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
S05E03,High Sparrow,441,You must want to wash.
S05E03,High Sparrow,442,Thank you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,443,"Welcome home, Lady Stark."
S05E03,High Sparrow,444,The North remembers.
S05E03,High Sparrow,445,Sam?
S05E03,High Sparrow,446,Maester Aemon?
S05E03,High Sparrow,447,He apologizes for not being here.
S05E03,High Sparrow,448,He's not feeling well.
S05E03,High Sparrow,449,Take good care of him.
S05E03,High Sparrow,450,Brothers.
S05E03,High Sparrow,451,"As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit."
S05E03,High Sparrow,452,First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint
S05E03,High Sparrow,453,a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.
S05E03,High Sparrow,454,Brian.
S05E03,High Sparrow,455,Seems like a good job for a ginger.
S05E03,High Sparrow,456,- That's him! - That's him.
S05E03,High Sparrow,457,Ser Alliser.
S05E03,High Sparrow,458,<i>You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,459,You proved your valor many times over
S05E03,High Sparrow,460,while defending the Wall from the wildling attack.
S05E03,High Sparrow,461,I name you First Ranger.
S05E03,High Sparrow,462,"Hear, hear!"
S05E03,High Sparrow,463,<i>Lord Janos.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,464,I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
S05E03,High Sparrow,465,Greyguard is a ruin.
S05E03,High Sparrow,466,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state."
S05E03,High Sparrow,467,Restore it as best you can.
S05E03,High Sparrow,468,First Builder Yarwyck can spare 10 of his--
S05E03,High Sparrow,469,<i> I was charged with the defense of King's Landing</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,470,when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.
S05E03,High Sparrow,471,Keep your ruin.
S05E03,High Sparrow,472,"All right, all right!"
S05E03,High Sparrow,473,Enough of that.
S05E03,High Sparrow,474,"You mistake me, my lord."
S05E03,High Sparrow,475,"That was a command, not an offer."
S05E03,High Sparrow,476,"Pack your arms and armor, say your farewells,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,477,and ride for Greyguard.
S05E03,High Sparrow,478,I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.
S05E03,High Sparrow,479,Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,480,"I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,481,I will not have it!
S05E03,High Sparrow,482,Are you refusing to obey my order?
S05E03,High Sparrow,483,You can stick your order up your bastard ass.
S05E03,High Sparrow,484,Take Lord Janos outside.
S05E03,High Sparrow,485,"Olly, bring me my sword."
S05E03,High Sparrow,486,- Get out. - You cannot do this!
S05E03,High Sparrow,487,<i>Get your hands off me!</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,488,"<i>Scum, all of you!</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,489,"If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken."
S05E03,High Sparrow,490,"Yes, very mistaken."
S05E03,High Sparrow,491,Disgrace!
S05E03,High Sparrow,492,I have friends.
S05E03,High Sparrow,493,Important friends in the capital.
S05E03,High Sparrow,494,- You'll see. - Kneel!
S05E03,High Sparrow,495,"If you have any last words, my lord,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,496,now's the time.
S05E03,High Sparrow,497,I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander.
S05E03,High Sparrow,498,<i>We all serve you.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,499,"<i>Not only for this, for all I've done and said.</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,500,I was wrong.
S05E03,High Sparrow,501,"My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy!"
S05E03,High Sparrow,502,I'll go! I will!
S05E03,High Sparrow,503,<i>Please.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,504,I'm afraid.
S05E03,High Sparrow,505,I've always been afraid.
S05E03,High Sparrow,506,"You have served us well, my son."
S05E03,High Sparrow,507,"Thank you, Father."
S05E03,High Sparrow,508,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
S05E03,High Sparrow,509,- The Maiden. - Always the Maiden.
S05E03,High Sparrow,510,<i>And the Stranger.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,511,"- Two is extra, you realize? - Yes, yes."
S05E03,High Sparrow,512,What are you doing?
S05E03,High Sparrow,513,This establishment belongs to Lord Petyr Baelish.
S05E03,High Sparrow,514,You can't--
S05E03,High Sparrow,515,"You have profaned our faith,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,516,the faith of our fathers and forefathers.
S05E03,High Sparrow,517,I am the High Septon of the--
S05E03,High Sparrow,518,You are a sinner.
S05E03,High Sparrow,519,And you shall be punished.
S05E03,High Sparrow,520,Ah!
S05E03,High Sparrow,521,- Sinner. - Sinner.
S05E03,High Sparrow,522,- Sinner. Sinner. <i>-  Repent!</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,523,Sinner. Sinner.
S05E03,High Sparrow,524,Sinner. Sinner.
S05E03,High Sparrow,525,<i>- Shame on you.</i> - Sinner. Sinner.
S05E03,High Sparrow,526,"Your Grace, Grand Maester,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,527,"Lord Tyrell, uh..."
S05E03,High Sparrow,528,It doesn't matter.
S05E03,High Sparrow,529,"Asthe High Septon pf the Faith of the Seven,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,530,I give voice to the will of the gods
S05E03,High Sparrow,531,and am their foremost servant in this world.
S05E03,High Sparrow,532,An insult to me is an insult to the gods.
S05E03,High Sparrow,533,An assault on my person
S05E03,High Sparrow,534,is an assault on our very religion.
S05E03,High Sparrow,535,- You were assaulted? - I was.
S05E03,High Sparrow,536,By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows.
S05E03,High Sparrow,537,"<i>They humiliated me,</i> <i>they beat me,</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,538,<i>they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,539,I am lucky to be alive.
S05E03,High Sparrow,540,I heard this assault began in Littlefinger's brothel.
S05E03,High Sparrow,541,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
S05E03,High Sparrow,542,<i> I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,543,Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.
S05E03,High Sparrow,544,So you were ministering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
S05E03,High Sparrow,545,A man's private affairs ought to stay private.
S05E03,High Sparrow,546,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,547,Justice. I ask that you protect our faith
S05E03,High Sparrow,548,by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells.
S05E03,High Sparrow,549,"<i>I ask that you execute</i> <i>their leader,</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,550,<i>this so-called</i> <i>High Sparrow.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,551,He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
S05E03,High Sparrow,552,- If he goes unpunished-- - And where do I find this man?
S05E03,High Sparrow,553,This High Sparrow?
S05E03,High Sparrow,554,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
S05E03,High Sparrow,555,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people."
S05E03,High Sparrow,556,Where can I find the High Sparrow?
S05E03,High Sparrow,557,<i>Seven blessings.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,558,<i>- Thank you.</i> <i>- Just a little more.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,559,<i>Thank you.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,560,Thank you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,561,A young man said I'd find the High Sparrow back here.
S05E03,High Sparrow,562,- Where is he? - High Sparrow?
S05E03,High Sparrow,563,"Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,564,Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle.
S05E03,High Sparrow,565,"Still, it's meant to."
S05E03,High Sparrow,566,We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us.
S05E03,High Sparrow,567,The notion that we're all equal in the eyes of the Seven
S05E03,High Sparrow,568,"doesn't sit well with some,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,569,so they belittle me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,570,"<i>Seven blessings</i> to you, my dear."
S05E03,High Sparrow,571,It's only a name.
S05E03,High Sparrow,572,Quite an easy burden to bear.
S05E03,High Sparrow,573,Far easier than hers.
S05E03,High Sparrow,574,<i>Why no shoes?</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,575,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.
S05E03,High Sparrow,576,We all do that.
S05E03,High Sparrow,577,It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
S05E03,High Sparrow,578,Is that why you came to King's Landing?
S05E03,High Sparrow,579,To remind everyone?
S05E03,High Sparrow,580,Everyone? Hard enough job reminding myself.
S05E03,High Sparrow,581,"Well, I tell them no one's special"
S05E03,High Sparrow,582,and they think I'm special for telling them so.
S05E03,High Sparrow,583,Perhaps they're right.
S05E03,High Sparrow,584,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,585,Have the gods sent you here to tempt me?
S05E03,High Sparrow,586,I hope not.
S05E03,High Sparrow,587,I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me
S05E03,High Sparrow,588,for that incident with the High Septon.
S05E03,High Sparrow,589,An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative
S05E03,High Sparrow,590,"of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
S05E03,High Sparrow,591,Hypocrisy is a boil.
S05E03,High Sparrow,592,Lancing a boil is never pleasant.
S05E03,High Sparrow,593,Although they could have been more careful with the blade.
S05E03,High Sparrow,594,The High Septon came to speak to me today.
S05E03,High Sparrow,595,He doesn't want me to arrest you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,596,He wants me to execute you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,597,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
S05E03,High Sparrow,598,My thoughts on the matter are in line with your own.
S05E03,High Sparrow,599,"The High Septon's behavior was corrosive, as was his attitude."
S05E03,High Sparrow,600,Having a man like that reside in the sept eats away at the faith from the inside.
S05E03,High Sparrow,601,So now he resides in the Red Keep dungeons instead.
S05E03,High Sparrow,602,The faith and the crown are the two pillars
S05E03,High Sparrow,603,that hold up this world.
S05E03,High Sparrow,604,"One collapses, so does the other."
S05E03,High Sparrow,605,We must do everything necessary to protect one another.
S05E03,High Sparrow,606,- Your Grace. - <i> Send a raven with this message</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,607,to Littlefinger at the Eyrie or wherever he's slithering about.
S05E03,High Sparrow,608,"At once, Your Grace."
S05E03,High Sparrow,609,How's your work coming along?
S05E03,High Sparrow,610,Very well.
S05E03,High Sparrow,611,You've made progress?
S05E03,High Sparrow,612,More than I expected.
S05E03,High Sparrow,613,"- Still a way to go, but... - Very good."
S05E03,High Sparrow,614,"I'll leave you to it, then."
S05E03,High Sparrow,615,"Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately."""
S05E03,High Sparrow,616,Shh.
S05E03,High Sparrow,617,"Easy, friend."
S05E03,High Sparrow,618,She really is lovely.
S05E03,High Sparrow,619,I hope I can make her happy.
S05E03,High Sparrow,620,"I hope so, too."
S05E03,High Sparrow,621,I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.
S05E03,High Sparrow,622,She's suffered enough.
S05E03,High Sparrow,623,I'll never hurt her.
S05E03,High Sparrow,624,You have my word.
S05E03,High Sparrow,625,"I've heard very little about you,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,626,which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go.
S05E03,High Sparrow,627,I haven't been a lord very long.
S05E03,High Sparrow,628,I was a bastard.
S05E03,High Sparrow,629,And you're not anymore.
S05E03,High Sparrow,630,Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
S05E03,High Sparrow,631,"Yes, Father."
S05E03,High Sparrow,632,"And thank you, Lord Baelish."
S05E03,High Sparrow,633,I'm forever in your debt.
S05E03,High Sparrow,634,He seems pleased.
S05E03,High Sparrow,635,Shouldn't he be?
S05E03,High Sparrow,636,"I assure you, she's still a virgin."
S05E03,High Sparrow,637,Tyrion never consummated the marriage.
S05E03,High Sparrow,638,"By the law of the land, she is no man's wife."
S05E03,High Sparrow,639,Inspect her if you must.
S05E03,High Sparrow,640,I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.
S05E03,High Sparrow,641,"It's her name I need, not her virtue."
S05E03,High Sparrow,642,Then I have delivered everything I promised.
S05E03,High Sparrow,643,And you're prepared for the consequences
S05E03,High Sparrow,644,when the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?
S05E03,High Sparrow,645,The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.
S05E03,High Sparrow,646,Tywin is dead.
S05E03,High Sparrow,647,He kept his house in power through sheer will.
S05E03,High Sparrow,648,"Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies."
S05E03,High Sparrow,649,"Tommen is a soft boy,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,650,not a king to fear.
S05E03,High Sparrow,651,The queen will be enraged.
S05E03,High Sparrow,652,<i>Queen Margaery</i> adores Sansa.
S05E03,High Sparrow,653,"Cersei is Queen Mother,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,654,a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.
S05E03,High Sparrow,655,"And yet she still has friends,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,656,men in important places whom she can ask for favors.
S05E03,High Sparrow,657,A message for you from Cersei Lannister.
S05E03,High Sparrow,658,A rider arrived from the Eyrie shortly before dawn.
S05E03,High Sparrow,659,Apparently she thinks you're still in the Vale.
S05E03,High Sparrow,660,A message for me you say?
S05E03,High Sparrow,661,Strange that the seal is broken.
S05E03,High Sparrow,662,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish."
S05E03,High Sparrow,663,"If you receive word in the night from the Queen Mother,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,664,it does make me question our new alliance.
S05E03,High Sparrow,665,"The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,666,yet here you are in the North undermining them.
S05E03,High Sparrow,667,Why gamble with your position?
S05E03,High Sparrow,668,Every ambitious move is a gamble.
S05E03,High Sparrow,669,You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart.
S05E03,High Sparrow,670,It appears that your gamble paid off.
S05E03,High Sparrow,671,You're Warden of the North.
S05E03,High Sparrow,672,I had Tywin Lannister's backing.
S05E03,High Sparrow,673,Who supports me now? You?
S05E03,High Sparrow,674,The Eyrie is mine.
S05E03,High Sparrow,675,The last time the lords of the Eyrie
S05E03,High Sparrow,676,"formed an alliance with the lords of the North,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,677,they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.
S05E03,High Sparrow,678,I'd like to borrow one of your birds.
S05E03,High Sparrow,679,Cersei will expect a reply.
S05E03,High Sparrow,680,I'd like to read the reply.
S05E03,High Sparrow,681,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
S05E03,High Sparrow,682,Volantis is a large city.
S05E03,High Sparrow,683,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
S05E03,High Sparrow,684,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
S05E03,High Sparrow,685,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
S05E03,High Sparrow,686,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
S05E03,High Sparrow,687,I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen
S05E03,High Sparrow,688,if I lose my mind.
S05E03,High Sparrow,689,I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
S05E03,High Sparrow,690,It's a perfectly good face.
S05E03,High Sparrow,691,I am losing my mind.
S05E03,High Sparrow,692,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
S05E03,High Sparrow,693,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros."
S05E03,High Sparrow,694,What am I?
S05E03,High Sparrow,695,One more drunk dwarf.
S05E03,High Sparrow,696,<i> Whoa!</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,697,<i>We have to go now.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,698,"<i>Come on, hold it.</i> <i>Hold it.</i>"
S05E03,High Sparrow,699,<i>Are you ready?</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,700,Slaves.
S05E03,High Sparrow,701,"Yes, the Volantene masters are very organized."
S05E03,High Sparrow,702,<i>Flies for dung shovelers.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,703,<i>Hammers for builders.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,704,<i>Tears for whores.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,705,Lest they forget.
S05E03,High Sparrow,706,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,707,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,708,We should keep moving.
S05E03,High Sparrow,709,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,710,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,711,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,712,The only red priest we had in King's Landing
S05E03,High Sparrow,713,was Thoros of Myr.
S05E03,High Sparrow,714,This one's much better-looking.
S05E03,High Sparrow,715,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,716,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,717,Stone Men.
S05E03,High Sparrow,718,Good luck stopping the spread of greyscale with prayer.
S05E03,High Sparrow,719,You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.
S05E03,High Sparrow,720,Shh.
S05E03,High Sparrow,721,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,722,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,723,We're going to meet the savior.
S05E03,High Sparrow,724,You should have told me.
S05E03,High Sparrow,725,<i>Who doesn't want</i> <i>to meet the savior?</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,726,Come on.
S05E03,High Sparrow,727,Let's find a brothel.
S05E03,High Sparrow,728,<i>Build your house in a day.</i>
S05E03,High Sparrow,729,_
S05E03,High Sparrow,730,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
S05E03,High Sparrow,731,See? We blend right in.
S05E03,High Sparrow,732,Just two more travelers mad with lust.
S05E03,High Sparrow,733,Thank you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,734,What curious hair.
S05E03,High Sparrow,735,The Mother of Dragons!
S05E03,High Sparrow,736,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
S05E03,High Sparrow,737,We were just heading east to see you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,738,I've got a dragon for you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,739,How much to make him spit fire?
S05E03,High Sparrow,740,Someone who inspires priests and whores
S05E03,High Sparrow,741,is worth taking seriously.
S05E03,High Sparrow,742,What makes you worth that much?
S05E03,High Sparrow,743,- I'm magic. - I'll bet you bloody are.
S05E03,High Sparrow,744,"Well, she's taken."
S05E03,High Sparrow,745,Where are you going?
S05E03,High Sparrow,746,I need to speak to someone with hair.
S05E03,High Sparrow,747,- Hello. - Hello.
S05E03,High Sparrow,748,- You've got no drink. - You've got no money.
S05E03,High Sparrow,749,Do I look like a man without money?
S05E03,High Sparrow,750,Never trust looks.
S05E03,High Sparrow,751,"Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world."
S05E03,High Sparrow,752,Who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh?
S05E03,High Sparrow,753,I always pay my debts.
S05E03,High Sparrow,754,I'm well known for it.
S05E03,High Sparrow,755,You like her.
S05E03,High Sparrow,756,They all like her.
S05E03,High Sparrow,757,They all want to fuck a queen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,758,That's because they've never met a queen.
S05E03,High Sparrow,759,You're just saying that.
S05E03,High Sparrow,760,You know how to spot a liar.
S05E03,High Sparrow,761,"If I could pick any girl here,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,762,I would pick you.
S05E03,High Sparrow,763,Why?
S05E03,High Sparrow,764,Because you have a skeptical mind.
S05E03,High Sparrow,765,"All right, then. I'm warning you,"
S05E03,High Sparrow,766,we're going to have to wash you first.
S05E03,High Sparrow,767,Come on.
S05E03,High Sparrow,768,"I'm-- I'm sorry, I can't."
S05E03,High Sparrow,769,Of course you can. You're shy.
S05E03,High Sparrow,770,I'm not.
S05E03,High Sparrow,771,Have another drink.
S05E03,High Sparrow,772,"Gladly, but this I can't do."
S05E03,High Sparrow,773,"Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am."
S05E03,High Sparrow,774,I hope it passes.
S05E03,High Sparrow,775,What will I do in my spare time?
S05E03,High Sparrow,776,Go for a piss. That's a start.
S05E03,High Sparrow,777,No need to worry. I was just--
S05E03,High Sparrow,778,"Oh, I thought you were someone else."
S05E03,High Sparrow,779,Show's almost over.
S05E03,High Sparrow,780,I'm sure there are girls inside who'd be happy to oblige.
S05E03,High Sparrow,781,You've made some kind of mistake.
S05E03,High Sparrow,782,Why don't you tell me what you think you're doing and then--
S05E03,High Sparrow,783,I'm taking you to the queen.

S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,3,"Tarth, Ser Jaime."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,4,The Sapphire Isle.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,5,Why are we on a merchant ship?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,6,Why no Lannister sails?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,7,This ship's sailing to Oldtown.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,8,"We'll get off earlier not far from Sunspear,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,9,row ourselves to the Dornish shore in the night.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,10,You ever been to Dorne?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,11,- No. - I have.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,12,The Dornish are crazy.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,13,"All they want to do is fight and fuck, fuck and fight."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,14,You should be happy to go back.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,15,There's nothing like a good fight
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,16,to get you in the mood for fucking.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,17,And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,18,to clear your head for the next fight.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,19,It's how the two work together.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,20,"Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting, I'm sure."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,21,"Well, I am."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,22,But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,23,Not after we've kidnapped their princess.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,24,We're not kidnapping their princess.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,25,"We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,26,Your niece?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,27,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,28,- I'm good at it. - That's why you're here.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,29,I know. Why are you here?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,30,Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,31,"Unlike most folks, you've actually got one."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,32,Because I don't want to start a war.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,33,That still doesn't explain what you're doing here.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,34,It has to be me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,35,"If I'm putting something like this together,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,36,a one-handed man who happens to be
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,37,one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not--
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,38,It has to be me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,39,"You set your brother free, didn't you?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,40,I'll bet your sister didn't like that.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,41,Varys set him free.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,42,"Well, if you ever see the wee fucker,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,43,give him my regards.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,44,He murdered my father.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,45,"If I ever see him, I'll split him in two."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,46,And then I'll give him your regards.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,47,The Iron Bank has called in one-tenth of the crown's debts.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,48,Given the expense of rebuilding the royal fleet--
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,49,How much can the crown afford?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,50,"<i>With winter coming,</i>"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,51,"half what they ask, less?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,52,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,53,House Tyrell could front the gold
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,54,and the crown would pay us back in time
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,55,or I'd have words with my daughter.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,56,You've already given us too much.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,57,"No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,58,- Absolutely. - In person.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,59,"- Me? - We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,60,someone of importance to show these bankers our respect.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,61,"As the king's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,62,"I would be honored, Your Grace."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,63,The king's expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,64,He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,65,My very own Kingsguard?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,66,"- Please express my-- - Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,67,Of course. Of course.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,68,I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,69,The small council grows smaller and smaller.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,70,Not small enough.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,71,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,72,No.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,73,The old High Septon would have asked the vintage.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,74,I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,75,and should be kept pure.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,76,But the truth is I don't like the taste.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,77,Hmm.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,78,How may I serve?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,79,"All over Westeros we hear of septs being burned,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,80,"Silent Sisters raped,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,81,bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,82,"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the gods."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,83,Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,84,"<i>In the days before</i> <i>the Targaryens,</i>"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,85,the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,86,"Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,87,"If I explain their holy purpose to my son the king,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,88,I have no doubt he will sign a decree
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,89,arming the believers you felt worthy.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,90,An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,91,An army in service to the gods themselves.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,92,"And to you, of course,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,93,as the chosen representative of the Seven.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,94,An honor I never expected.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,95,"Or, indeed, ever wished for."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,96,Which is why you were chosen.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,97,You and I both know how the world works.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,98,"Too often the wicked are the wealthiest,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,99,beyond the reach of justice.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,100,The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,101,All sinners are equal before the gods.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,102,What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,103,Shielded by gold and privilege.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,104,May the Father judge him justly.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,105,What are you doing?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,106,Help me! Help me!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,107,Yeah. Yeah.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,108,Get off me!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,109,Come on.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,110,Shut up! Move!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,111,This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,112,<i>Cocksuckers.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,113,<i>Boy fucker.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,114,<i>You buggering filth!</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,115,There's a special place in the seventh hell for your kind.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,116,"Please. Please, I'll pay."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,117,I'll-- I'll pay all of you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,118,"Yes, you will."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,119,Seize him.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,120,Sinner.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,121,Get your hands off me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,122,"Ser Loras of House Tyrell,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,123,you have broken the laws of gods and men.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,124,Who do you think you are?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,125,Justice.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,126,Why is my brother in a cell?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,127,I-I don't know.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,128,I-I didn't order it.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,129,We both know who did.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,130,You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,131,Are you saying my mother's behind this?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,132,She's jealous you're not hers anymore.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,133,<i>Arresting my brother</i> <i>is her revenge.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,134,Aren't you and Mother getting along?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,135,"Oh, my sweet, sweet king."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,136,Do you have any affection for me at all?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,137,Of course I do.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,138,You're my queen.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,139,I can't bear to think of my brother
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,140,locked away in some grimy cell.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,141,I'll set him free for you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,142,Do you promise?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,143,I demand that Ser Loras be freed now.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,144,Did I arrest him?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,145,"Well, no."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,146,But y-you armed the Faith Militant.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,147,You gave the High Sparrow an army.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,148,I did.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,149,And your wife has every right to criticize.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,150,We can't allow fanatics to arrest the queen's brother
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,151,no matter his perversions.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,152,Then...
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,153,can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,154,"I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,155,You're the king.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,156,"I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,157,he'll release the poor boy.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,158,Halt!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,159,His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,160,Give the order and we'll clear out this rabble.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,161,"You mean, kill them?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,162,Here at the sept?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,163,You'd be sending them to meet the gods that they love.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,164,<i>Bastard!</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,165,<i>You're an abomination!</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,166,<i>Born of sin!</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,167,<i>Filthy bastard!</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,168,We'll find another way.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,169,<i>Abomination!</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,170,My queen?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,171,There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,172,"You're the King of the Andals,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,173,"the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,174,"<i>the Protector of the Realm,</i>"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,175,<i>and you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,176,I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,177,Are you? When?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,178,- I-I don't know. - You don't know?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,179,He was praying just now.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,180,I have to send word to Grandmother.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,181,Will you come back later?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,182,"I need to be with my family, Your Grace."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,183,Of course.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,184,You think highly of this boy?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,185,Good.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,186,Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,187,And a bastard by some tavern slut.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,188,"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,189,I should have given you a son.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,190,Not your fault.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,191,"Whose, then?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,192,I gave you nothing but weakness.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,193,And deformity.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,194,Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,195,My lady.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,196,"Her father is the Lord's chosen king,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,197,and her father's blood runs through her veins.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,198,You march on Winterfell soon?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,199,We must to beat the snows.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,200,"Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,201,and left me behind.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,202,I hope you won't make that mistake again.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,203,I won't.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,204,I need you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,205,"You only need faith, my king."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,206,"And you, my lady, what do you need?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,207,To serve my Lord.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,208,Lord Ashford.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,209,Lady Caulfield.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,210,"Oh, Lord Smallwood."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,211,I've never even heard of these people.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,212,"They haven't heard of you, either."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,213,But we need men and they have some.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,214,How many men does this Lord Mayzen have to send us?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,215,More than Lord Wibberley.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,216,"- Not him. - <i> I know, I'm sorry.</i>"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,217,But we need men and supplies
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,218,and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,219,He murdered my brother.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,220,We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,221,We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,222,And we can't get more men
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,223,without help from the Warden of the North.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,224,"Apologies, my lady."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,225,Lord Commander.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,226,How can I help you?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,227,<i>Come with us when we ride south.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,228,None of us know the castle as well as you do.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,229,"Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,230,its people.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,231,Winterfell was your home once.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,232,Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,233,Castle Black is my home now.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,234,<i>The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,235,There's only one war.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,236,Life against death.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,237,"Come, let me show you what you're fighting for."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,238,You're gonna show me some vision in the fire?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,239,"Forgive me, my lady, I don't trust in visions."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,240,No visions. No magic.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,241,Just life.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,242,Do you feel my heart beating?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,243,There's power in you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,244,"You resist it, and that's your mistake."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,245,Embrace it.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,246,The Lord of Light made us male and female.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,247,Two parts of a greater whole.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,248,"In our joining, there's power."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,249,"Power to make life,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,250,"power to make light,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,251,and power to cast shadows.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,252,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,253,Then we shouldn't tell him.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,254,- I can't. - Why?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,255,I swore a vow.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,256,I loved another.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,257,The dead don't need lovers.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,258,Only the living.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,259,I know.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,260,But I still love her.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,261,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,262,Are you lonely?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,263,Just bored.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,264,My father used to tell me that boredom
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,265,indicates a lack of inner resources.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,266,"Were you bored a lot, too?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,267,I know Castle Black
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,268,"is no place for a child, but--"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,269,I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,270,I know Mother didn't want to bring me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,271,Why do you say that?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,272,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,273,She shouldn't have said that.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,274,"Are you ashamed of me, Father?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,275,"When you were an infant,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,276,a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,277,His goods were junk except for one wooden doll.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,278,He had even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,279,No doubt he had heard of your birth
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,280,and assumed new fathers were easy targets.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,281,I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,282,How you pressed it to your cheek.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,283,"By the time we burned the doll, it was too late."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,284,I was told you would die.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,285,"Or worse,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,286,the greyscale would go slow.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,287,<i>Let you grow just enough</i> <i>to know the world</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,288,<i>before taking it away from you.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,289,Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,290,to live out your short life with the Stone Men
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,291,<i>before the sickness</i> <i>spread through the castle.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,292,I told them all to go to hell.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,293,<i>I called in every maester</i> <i>on this side of the world.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,294,Every healer. Every apothecary.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,295,They stopped the disease and saved your life.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,296,'Cause you did not belong across the world
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,297,with the bloody Stone Men.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,298,You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,299,And you are my daughter.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,300,<i>I thought I might find you here.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,301,<i>Your Aunt Lyanna.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,302,Father never talked about her.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,303,Sometimes I'd find him down here lighting the candles.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,304,They say she was beautiful.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,305,I saw her once.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,306,I was a boy living with your mother's family.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,307,Lord Whent held a great tourney at Harrenhal.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,308,Everyone was there.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,309,"The Mad King, your father,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,310,"Robert Baratheon,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,311,and Lyanna.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,312,She was already promised to Robert.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,313,"You can imagine what it was like for me,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,314,"a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,315,watching these legendary men
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,316,tilting at the lists.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,317,The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,318,and Rhaegar Targaryen.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,319,"When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for their prince."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,320,I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,321,and they saw that silver hair.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,322,How handsome he was.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,323,"Until he rode right past his wife,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,324,"Elia Martell,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,325,and all the smiles died.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,326,I've never seen so many people so quiet.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,327,He rode past his wife
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,328,and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,329,Blue as frost.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,330,How many tens of thousands had to die
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,331,because Rhaegar chose your aunt?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,332,"Yes, he chose her."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,333,And then he kidnapped her and raped her.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,334,Come.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,335,Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,336,You're dressed for riding.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,337,I am.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,338,Where are you going?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,339,King's Landing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,340,King's Landing?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,341,Cersei sent for me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,342,We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,343,You can't leave me here.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,344,I know how hard it is to live with people you despise.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,345,Believe me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,346,But it won't be for long.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,347,How do you know?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,348,Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,349,He'll march south to King's Landing
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,350,before the winter snows block his way.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,351,But first he has to take Winterfell.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,352,- You don't know that. - I do.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,353,"Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,354,he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,355,"With the North behind him,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,356,Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,357,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,358,He has a larger army.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,359,He's the finest military commander in Westeros.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,360,A betting man would put his money on Stannis.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,361,"As it happens, I am a betting man."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,362,And if you're right?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,363,"Stannis takes Winterfell,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,364,he rescues you from the most despised family in the North.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,365,"Grateful for your late father's courageous support of his claim,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,366,he names you Wardeness of the North.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,367,But I--
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,368,I wouldn't--
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,369,Wardeness of the North?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,370,You are the last surviving Stark.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,371,He needs you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,372,And what if you're wrong?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,373,What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,374,Or he does and the Boltons defeat him?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,375,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,376,and make him yours.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,377,I don't know how to do that.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,378,Of course you do.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,379,He's already fallen for you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,380,His father frightens me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,381,He should. He's a dangerous man.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,382,But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,383,And you've learned to maneuver from the very best.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,384,I'll return before too long.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,385,You'll be strong without me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,386,The North will be yours.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,387,Do you believe me?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,388,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,389,Breakfast.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,390,That would have been a shit way to die.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,391,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,392,"Aye, but your lot have to give the singers a good ending."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,393,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,394,No?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,395,Two knights off to rescue a princess.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,396,Sounds like a good song to me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,397,Sounds like all the rest.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,398,What about you?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,399,What shit way would you choose?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,400,In my own keep drinking my own wine
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,401,watching my sons grovel for my fortune.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,402,How disappointing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,403,I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,404,I've had an exciting life.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,405,I want my death to be boring.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,406,How do you want to go?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,407,In the arms of the woman I love.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,408,She want the same thing?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,409,Let's go.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,410,The captain of that ship--
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,411,"what was he, Braavosi?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,412,Pentoshi.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,413,And he's headed to Oldtown?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,414,As I said. Why?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,415,What's to stop him from docking down the coast
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,416,and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,417,A bag of gold.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,418,I'm not sure you understand
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,419,how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,420,It was a heavy bag.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,421,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,422,But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,423,<i>How many you count?</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,424,Four.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,425,How many do you think you can take?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,426,One if he's slow.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,427,Halt!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,428,Over the hill.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,429,Fucked in the ass.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,430,Hyah!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,431,"Morning, lads."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,432,Glad we found you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,433,Who are you?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,434,Cooper.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,435,This is Darnell.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,436,You're from King's Landing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,437,Accent gave me away?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,438,"Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,439,Why are you here?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,440,Our ship capsized in the night.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,441,We managed to swim ashore.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,442,"It was a near thing, really."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,443,Thought the sharks would get us.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,444,There are no sharks in Dorne.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,445,Could have sworn those were shark fins.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,446,"Dolphins, maybe."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,447,Throw your swords in the sand.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,448,"Boys, there's no need for this."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,449,"Just point us in the right direction,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,450,we'll find our way home.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,451,Swords in the sand now.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,452,Hyah! Hyah!
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,453,That one should be slow enough.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,454,<i>Nice move.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,455,Luck.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,456,You had a wonderful teacher.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,457,Always wanted a Dornish stallion.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,458,Beasts can run a day and night without tiring.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,459,We'll ride to the Water Gardens
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,460,with a nice breeze in our faces.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,461,First we need to bury these bodies.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,462,"Birds have to eat, too."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,463,Corpses raise questions. Questions raise armies.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,464,We're not here to start a war.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,465,Do you know how long it'll take us to dig all those holes?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,466,I can't dig very well with one hand.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,467,"Not at all, really."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,468,Mama.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,469,"Nym, Obara."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,470,Will it be war?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,471,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,472,We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,473,"Without Doran, we have no army to march against the Lannisters."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,474,We don't need an army to start a war.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,475,<i>Queen Cersei loves her children.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,476,And we have one of them.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,477,You may have a problem.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,478,A ship's captain who found me in Planky Town
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,479,claiming he had information to sell.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,480,He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,481,He's come for Myrcella.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,482,"If he gets to her before we do,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,483,we lose our only chance for revenge.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,484,You must choose.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,485,"Doran's way and peace,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,486,or my way and war.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,487,I'm with you always.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,488,Nym?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,489,Obara?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,490,"When I was a child, Oberyn came to take me to court."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,491,"I had never seen this man,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,492,and yet he called himself my father.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,493,"My mother wept,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,494,said I was too young and a girl.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,495,"Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,496,"""Girl or boy, we fight our battles,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,497,"but the gods let us choose our weapons."""
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,498,My father pointed to the spear
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,499,and then to my mother's tears.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,500,I made my choice long ago.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,501,Will you untie me?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,502,<i>Will you please untie me?</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,503,Will you please?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,504,Thank you.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,505,Who are you?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,506,Your captor.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,507,Do you have wine?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,508,<i>No.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,509,Can't sleep without wine.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,510,Then stay awake.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,511,You're going the wrong way.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,512,My sister is in Westeros.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,513,Westeros is west.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,514,We're heading east.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,515,<i>I'm not taking you</i> <i>to your sister.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,516,You said you were taking me to the queen.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,517,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,518,She's the queen I serve.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,519,What a waste of a good kidnapping.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,520,It so happens I was heading there myself.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,521,What business would you have with the queen?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,522,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,523,"If you'd ever met my sister, you'd understand."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,524,"So, now that it's clear we are on the same side..."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,525,<i>A highborn knight from the North of Westeros</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,526,down on his luck in Essos.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,527,"Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,528,You're Jorah Mormont.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,529,<i>I have to ask.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,530,How exactly were you serving your queen
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,531,in a whorehouse half a world away?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,532,Is it possible that you were running?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,533,Why would you be running?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,534,And why would she have sent you away?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,535,"Oh, wait."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,536,"You were spying on her, weren't you?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,537,<i>It's all coming back to me.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,538,"I was drunk through most of the small council meetings,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,539,but it's all coming back.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,540,You passed notes to Varys's little birds.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,541,"<i>She found out, didn't she?</i>"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,542,<i>Found out and exiled you.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,543,Now you hope to win back her favor with a gift.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,544,Risky scheme.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,545,<i>One might even say desperate.</i>
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,546,You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,547,I'd say the reverse is just as likely.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,548,Everyone looks happy enough from up here.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,549,What?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,550,I was thinking about all the times your brother
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,551,made me go with him down from the Red Keep
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,552,into the streets of King's Landing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,553,- Why? - He liked to walk among the people.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,554,He liked to sing to them.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,555,He sang to them?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,556,Yes.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,557,Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,558,or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,559,Just like all the other minstrels.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,560,And what did you do?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,561,I made sure no one killed him.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,562,And I collected the money.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,563,What? He liked to see how much he could make.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,564,- He was good? - He was very good.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,565,Viserys never told you?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,566,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,567,Rhaegar never liked killing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,568,He loved singing.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,569,And what did you do with the money?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,570,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,571,"One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,572,"One time, we got horribly drunk."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,573,Your Grace.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,574,"Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,575,How many others are there?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,576,50? 100?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,577,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,578,I think I can protect you from Hizdahr zo Loraq.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,579,I think I can protect me from Hizdahr zo Loraq.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,580,"Go, Ser Barristan."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,581,Sing a song for me.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,582,Your Grace.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,583,"All men must die, but not all can die in glory."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,584,- Glory? - Why else do men fight?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,585,Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,586,and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,587,So their names would live on.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,588,Those who find victory in the fighting pits
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,589,"will never become kings, but their names will live on."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,590,It's the best chance they'll ever have.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,591,Is that what you used to tell men
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,592,before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,593,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,594,I do not recognize this tradition.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,595,"Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city,"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,596,"your city, together."
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,597,"Without them, former slaves and former masters"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,598,have nothing in common.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,599,Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment.
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,600,"<i>I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems,</i>"
S05E04,Sons Of The Harpy,601,but it's a start.

S05E05,Kill The Boy,8,butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.

S05E05,Kill The Boy,66,"Kill the boy, Jon Snow."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,67,Winter is almost upon us.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,68,Kill the boy
S05E05,Kill The Boy,69,and let the man be born.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,70,Where are the rest of the free folk now?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,71,Where have they gone?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,72,Who leads them?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,73,They followed Mance.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,74,They won't follow anyone else.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,75,What about you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,76,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,77,What if I unchained you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,78,Why would you do that?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,79,Because you are not my enemy.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,80,And I'm not yours.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,81,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,82,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,83,to be the shield that guards the realms of men.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,84,"And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,85,You belong to the realms of men.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,86,All of you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,87,And now everything is going to change?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,88,- It is. - Why now?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,89,Because now I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,90,"What would you have me do,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,91,Lord Commander?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,92,I'd have you go north of the Wall.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,93,Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,94,I'll open the gates for them and let them through.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,95,I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,96,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,97,I don't want them to kneel for me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,98,I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,99,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows
S05E05,Kill The Boy,100,is the day my people cut my guts from my belly
S05E05,Kill The Boy,101,and make me eat them.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,102,And how many of your people can't fight?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,103,"The women, the children, the old, the sick--"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,104,what happens to them?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,105,You're condemning them to death.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,106,Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,107,Or maybe you're not proud.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,108,Maybe you're just a coward.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,109,Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,110,Your people need a leader.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,111,And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,112,We don't have much time and they have less.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,113,The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,114,I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,115,Make peace to save your people.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,116,Most of them are at Hardhome.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,117,You know where that is?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,118,Up on Storrold's Point.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,119,I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,120,You can get there in a week.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,121,We'll need ships.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,122,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,123,"All right, then."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,124,You're coming with me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,125,<i>You're the Lord Commander</i> <i>of the Night's Watch.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,126,They need to hear it from you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,127,They need to know the ships they are boarding
S05E05,Kill The Boy,128,wot be torched in the middle of the sea.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,129,You come with me or I don't go.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,130,You'd bring wildlings here through our gates?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,131,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,132,Let them die. We got our own to worry about.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,133,Less enemies for us.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,134,Fewer.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,135,- What? - Nothing.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,136,"Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,137,Land that no one uses now.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,138,A dozen abandoned villages.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,139,And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,140,<i>Because the wildlings</i> <i>raided them for years.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,141,Cut them down!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,142,Just like they did this boy's people.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,143,Aye!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,144,<i> We've been fighting them for thousands of years.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,145,They've slaughtered villages.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,146,<i>They've slaughtered</i> <i>our brothers.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,147,And we've slaughtered theirs.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,148,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,149,- But they killed Grenn. - Yes.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,150,- And they killed Pyp. - Aye.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,151,<i>They killed 50 of our brothers.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,152,<i>I can't forget that.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,153,I can't forgive it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,154,You were at the Fist of the First Men.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,155,"If we abandon them, you know what they become."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,156,<i>We can learn to live</i> <i>with the wildlings</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,157,<i>or we can add them</i> <i>to the army of the dead.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,158,"Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,159,Thank you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,160,<i>Olly.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,161,"<i>If you have something</i> <i>you want to say to me,</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,162,<i>say it.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,163,It's all right.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,164,"You don't mean it, do you?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,165,Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,166,You're just doing it to trick them.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,167,It's not a trick.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,168,They burned my village.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,169,They put an arrow through my father's head
S05E05,Kill The Boy,170,right in front of me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,171,"They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,172,I know what it's like to lose the people you love.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,173,I know this is hard for you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,174,But winter is coming.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,175,We know what's coming with it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,176,We can't face it alone.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,177,"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,178,No.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,179,She's far away from the Lannisters.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,180,<i>This is her home.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,181,Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,182,Better off with the Boltons
S05E05,Kill The Boy,183,who murdered her mother and brother?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,184,Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,185,Thank you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,186,You've lived here a long time?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,187,Aye.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,188,Did you know Lord Eddard?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,189,I knew him
S05E05,Kill The Boy,190,and his father before him.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,191,The Starks are gone now.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,192,Not all of them.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,193,<i>I know who's inside that castle.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,194,Everyone knows.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,195,The Boltons.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,196,I'm not talking about the Boltons.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,197,I need to get a message to her.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,198,To Sansa Stark.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,199,Who are you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,200,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,201,Swore to who?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,202,Her mother.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,203,Her mother's dead.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,204,That doesn't release me from an oath.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,205,I served Lady Catelyn.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,206,I serve her still.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,207,Who do you serve?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,208,<i>Come back here.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,209,Myranda.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,210,I saw you staring at her.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,211,I'm going to marry her.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,212,That will involve looking at her from time to time.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,213,You said you'd marry me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,214,And I meant it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,215,When I was a bastard named Snow.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,216,<i>But I'm a Bolton now.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,217,What I want is no longer the primary consideration.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,218,I'm furthering a dynasty.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,219,Do you think she's pretty?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,220,Of course I do.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,221,I'm not blind.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,222,"You think she's pretty, too."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,223,I'm looking forward to our wedding night.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,224,"But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,225,"Perhaps I'll marry, too."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,226,You're the kennel master's daughter.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,227,"Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,228,You're mine.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,229,You're not going anywhere.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,230,Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,231,Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,232,"You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,233,Never.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,234,"Beg pardon, my lady."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,235,I've come to refill the wash basin.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,236,"Oh, I don't need--"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,237,You still have friends in the North.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,238,"If you're ever in trouble,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,239,light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,240,- But who-- - You're not alone.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,241,I like your dress.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,242,Who made it for you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,243,I made it myself.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,244,Really?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,245,Who-- who are you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,246,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,247,May I?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,248,"Oh, wonderful."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,249,The stitching.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,250,- Who taught you? - My mother.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,251,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,252,Thank you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,253,It's good that she taught you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,254,It was a gift.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,255,"Now every time you wear something you made,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,256,you can remember her.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,257,I'd rather have a mother.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,258,I know. It's not the same.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,259,"Still, it's good to remember."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,260,Remember the way things were.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,261,I almost forgot.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,262,There's something else
S05E05,Kill The Boy,263,<i>to help you remember.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,264,Down there at the end.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,265,What is it?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,266,That would spoil the surprise.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,267,"Go ahead, it's perfectly safe."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,268,You won't believe it when you see it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,269,Theon?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,270,You shouldn't be here.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,271,You smell particularly ripe this evening.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,272,Pour me some wine.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,273,Do you have something to tell me?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,274,"No, my lord."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,275,Reek.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,276,She saw me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,277,Who?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,278,Sansa. Lady Sansa.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,279,She came to the kennels.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,280,She saw you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,281,"Yes. I'm sorry, master."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,282,Forgive me. I didn't think--
S05E05,Kill The Boy,283,Come here.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,284,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,285,Get on your knees.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,286,Give me your hand.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,287,I forgive you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,288,"I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,289,"Yes, thank you, my lord."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,290,Allow me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,291,Mother.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,292,"Thank you, Ramsay."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,293,"My lady, we are all a family, we northerners."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,294,Our blood ties go back thousands of years.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,295,So I'd like to drink to our wedding.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,296,May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin
S05E05,Kill The Boy,297,to the Last Hearth.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,298,To your wedding.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,299,To your wedding.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,300,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,301,This isn't a strange place. This is my home.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,302,It's the people who are strange.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,303,You're right.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,304,Very strange.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,305,"More wine, please."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,306,<i> I heard you two had reunited.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,307,A fitting place for it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,308,I like to imagine that the last time you spoke
S05E05,Kill The Boy,309,was in this very room.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,310,<i>Are you still angry with him</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,311,<i>after he...</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,312,what he did?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,313,Don't worry.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,314,The North remembers.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,315,I punished him for it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,316,He's not ironborn anymore.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,317,Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,318,He's a new man.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,319,"A new person, anyway."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,320,"Aren't you, Reek?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,321,"Yes, master."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,322,That's his new name-- Reek.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,323,Why are you doing this?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,324,Because Reek has something to say to you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,325,"Don't you, Reek?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,326,An apology.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,327,Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,328,Apologize for murdering her two brothers.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,329,I'm sorry.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,330,"Look at her, Reek."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,331,<i>An apology doesn't mean anything</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,332,<i>if you're not looking</i> <i>the person in the eye.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,333,- I'm sorry. <i>-  Sorry about what?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,334,For killing your brothers.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,335,"There, over and done with."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,336,<i>Doesn't everyone</i> <i>feel better? I do.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,337,That was getting very tense.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,338,Whew.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,339,"You know what, my lady?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,340,What with him having murdered your brothers
S05E05,Kill The Boy,341,and the rest of your family gone...
S05E05,Kill The Boy,342,Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin
S05E05,Kill The Boy,343,that you have left.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,344,Reek.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,345,You will give away the bride.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,346,Someone has to. What better person?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,347,Good? Good?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,348,"Yes, yes, very good."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,349,Wonderful.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,350,"Walda and I have some good news as well,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,351,since we're all together.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,352,We're going to have a baby.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,353,I'm very happy for you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,354,"From the way she's carrying,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,355,Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,356,<i>How can you be sure?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,357,Sure of what?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,358,That she's pregnant.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,359,I mean...
S05E05,Kill The Boy,360,how can you tell?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,361,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,362,So how did you manage it?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,363,Manage what?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,364,Getting her pregnant.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,365,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,366,"Of course, but how did you..."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,367,find it?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,368,You disgraced yourself at dinner
S05E05,Kill The Boy,369,parading that creature before the Stark girl.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,370,And if it's a boy?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,371,You're worried about your position.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,372,My position is quite clear.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,373,I'm your son
S05E05,Kill The Boy,374,until a better alternative comes along.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,375,You've never asked me about your mother.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,376,Why would I?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,377,"She had me, she died."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,378,And here we are.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,379,She was a peasant girl.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,380,Pretty in a common sort of way.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,381,She was the miller's wife.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,382,Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,383,So I had him hanged
S05E05,Kill The Boy,384,and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,385,She fought me the whole time.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,386,"She was lucky I didn't hang her, too."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,387,<i>A year later</i> <i>she came to my gates</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,388,<i>with a squalling baby</i> <i>in her arms.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,389,<i>A baby she claimed was mine.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,390,I nearly had her whipped
S05E05,Kill The Boy,391,and the child thrown in the river.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,392,But then I looked at you
S05E05,Kill The Boy,393,<i>and I saw then what I see now.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,394,You are my son.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,395,Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,396,But he won't stay for long.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,397,"He wants the Iron Throne,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,398,and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,399,He means to take the North.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,400,But the North is ours.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,401,It's yours and mine.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,402,Will you help me defeat him?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,403,Yes.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,404,Is this every book there is?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,405,Every book there is?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,406,"- In the world. - Well, no."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,407,There are thousands and thousands of books out there.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,408,"This library is rather small, actually."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,409,"Where you grew up, were there more books?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,410,My father's not the most literate man.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,411,They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,412,Where's that?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,413,The Citadel?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,414,In Oldtown.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,415,I'm sorry I don't know things.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,416,"Gilly, look at me."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,417,<i>You know how to do a hundred things I can never do.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,418,You can build a fire with wet wood.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,419,You can cook. You can stitch a wound.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,420,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,421,- Well... - Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,422,<i>It's where they train</i> <i>the maesters.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,423,Like Maester Aemon?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,424,I wanted to be one when I was young.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,425,"Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,426,Far more adventure up here anyway.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,427,I wouldn't have met you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,428,"Ah, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,429,You're Samwell Tarly?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,430,"I am, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,431,Your father is Randyll Tarly.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,432,He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,433,<i>Only battle Robert ever lost.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,434,"I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,435,"<i>Fine soldier, your father.</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,436,You don't look like a soldier.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,437,But I'm told you killed a white walker.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,438,"I did, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,439,<i>How?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,440,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,441,Dragonglass?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,442,What the maesters call obsidian.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,443,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,444,Why would obsidian kill a walker?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,445,I don't know.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,446,I've been going through all the old manuscripts
S05E05,Kill The Boy,447,"hoping to find something, and all I've learned"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,448,is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,449,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,450,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,451,Seen what?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,452,The army of the dead.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,453,- And when they come-- - We have to know how to fight them.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,454,"Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,455,It's time.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,456,"Uh, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,457,Wouldn't it be better to wait?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,458,"When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,459,If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,460,We can't wait that long.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,461,"We have the advantage-- more men, more horses, all fed and rested."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,462,"<i>But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor.</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,463,This could turn to winter at any moment.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,464,We have to act now. Give the order.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,465,We march at sunrise.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,466,I'll choose a dozen men to stay
S05E05,Kill The Boy,467,and guard the queen and the princess.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,468,No need. They're coming with us.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,469,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,470,- Won't they be safer-- - Here?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,471,Half these watchmen are killers and rapists.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,472,"No, they march with us."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,473,"As you wish, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,474,<i> Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,475,Beg your pardon?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,476,At Winterfell.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,477,All the Kings in the North are buried there.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,478,Bran the Builder and King Dorren and--
S05E05,Kill The Boy,479,First things first. It's a long march ahead.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,480,And then we have to take the castle.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,481,Is there going to be a battle?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,482,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near--"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,483,"That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,484,You'll scare the child.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,485,"<i>Yes, my queen.</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,486,"- I'm not scared. - Well, I am."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,487,"When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,488,I promise.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,489,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,490,I need those ships.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,491,"You'll get them back, I swear it."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,492,"Have a safe journey, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,493,And thank you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,494,<i>Mount up!</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,495,<i>Colors!</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,496,No.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,497,You're still too weak.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,498,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,499,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,500,Ser Barristan?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,501,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,502,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,503,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,504,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,505,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,506,_
S05E05,Kill The Boy,507,<i>Are you ashamed?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,508,"<i>You were ambushed, outnumbered.</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,509,<i>There was no way</i> <i>you could have known.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,510,This is not why.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,511,"Wounded in war,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,512,there is no shame for this.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,513,I am ashamed
S05E05,Kill The Boy,514,because when the knife go in
S05E05,Kill The Boy,515,"and I fall to the ground,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,516,I am afraid.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,517,All men fear death.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,518,"No, not death."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,519,I fear
S05E05,Kill The Boy,520,I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,521,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,522,"If I give everyone what they deserve,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,523,I'll have no one left to rule.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,524,Ser Barristan counseled mercy
S05E05,Kill The Boy,525,when I took this city right up to the morning he died.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,526,<i>Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,527,<i>and let the rest of the city fend for itself.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,528,What do you think?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,529,"Your Grace, I think that I am not fit"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,530,to have an opinion on these matters.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,531,You are as fit as anyone I know.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,532,You know why I'm here.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,533,And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,534,<i>So what do you think?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,535,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,536,I have seen you listen to your counselors.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,537,I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking
S05E05,Kill The Boy,538,and weigh the choices they put before you.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,539,And I have seen you ignore your counselors...
S05E05,Kill The Boy,540,because there was a better choice.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,541,One that only you could see.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,542,"My-- my queen, please do not do this."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,543,"<i>What about ""valar morghulis""?</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,544,I did not want to die a coward.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,545,Apparently I do not want to die at all.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,546,It takes courage to admit fear.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,547,And to admit a mistake.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,548,I came here to tell you that I was wrong.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,549,I was wrong and you were right.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,550,About tradition.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,551,About bringing the people of this city together.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,552,I will reopen the fighting pits.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,553,To free men only.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,554,"Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,555,"Yes, my queen."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,556,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,557,I will marry the leader of an ancient family.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,558,Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,559,Don't worry.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,560,"I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,561,Where are we now?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,562,Not the Rhoyne.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,563,"Long, sullen silences"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,564,and an occasional punch in the face.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,565,The Mormont way.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,566,Let's start over.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,567,I apologize for before.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,568,<i>My mouth sometimes</i> <i>runs away from me.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,569,This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,570,We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,571,We are.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,572,What would make our time together truly enjoyable
S05E05,Kill The Boy,573,would be some wine.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,574,No wine.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,575,I am a person who drinks.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,576,People who drink need to keep drinking.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,577,"<i>Otherwise, they're not...</i>"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,578,I know where we are.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,579,You're taking us through Valyria.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,580,I am.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,581,Have you sailed this route before?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,582,No.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,583,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir
S05E05,Kill The Boy,584,from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,585,I think you'll be plenty.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,586,<i>You know what they say.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,587,The Doom still rules Valyria.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,588,What about the demons and the flames?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,589,<i>Aren't you afraid of the Doom?</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,590,<i>No.</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,591,But pirates are.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,592,Oh.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,593,The Smoking Sea.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,594,How many centuries before we learn
S05E05,Kill The Boy,595,how to build cities like this again?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,596,Thousands of years the Valyrians were
S05E05,Kill The Boy,597,the best in the world at almost everything.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,598,And then...
S05E05,Kill The Boy,599,And then they weren't.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,600,And then they weren't.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,601,"""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,602,<i>The hills that split asunder</i>
S05E05,Kill The Boy,603,and the black that ate the skies;
S05E05,Kill The Boy,604,The flames that shot so high and hot
S05E05,Kill The Boy,605,that even dragons burned;
S05E05,Kill The Boy,606,Would never be the final sights
S05E05,Kill The Boy,607,that fell upon their eyes.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,608,"A fly upon a wall,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,609,"the waves the sea wind whipped and churned--"""
S05E05,Kill The Boy,610,"""The city of a thousand years,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,611,and all that men had learned;
S05E05,Kill The Boy,612,"The Doom consumed it all alike,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,613,"and neither of them turned."""
S05E05,Kill The Boy,614,I would clap.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,615,"I suppose this is it, then."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,616,This is what remains.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,617,What was that?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,618,Stone Men!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,619,Don't let them touch you!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,620,Get behind!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,621,"Mormont, cut me free!"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,622,Mormont!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,623,Mormont!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,624,Mormont!
S05E05,Kill The Boy,625,Tyrion?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,626,Tyrion.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,627,Tyrion.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,628,Tyrion.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,629,You're all right.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,630,You're heavier than you look.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,631,Did any of them touch you?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,632,You?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,633,"I've seen greyscale before,"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,634,but nothing like that.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,635,I suppose that's why they send them there.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,636,It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,637,Thank you for saving me.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,638,"Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,639,if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,640,So what now?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,641,We walk up the coast.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,642,"With luck, we'll find a fishing village."
S05E05,Kill The Boy,643,Maybe another boat.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,644,Without luck?
S05E05,Kill The Boy,645,We've got a long walk ahead of us.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,646,I'll get some wood for a fire.
S05E05,Kill The Boy,647,"Try to get some rest, huh?"
S05E05,Kill The Boy,648,That's the best idea you've had all day.

S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",4,I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",5,until you tell me why I'm doing it.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",6,You will know why.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",7,"- When? - When it's time, not before."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",8,Get back to work.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",9,When do I get to play the game?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",10,Game?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",11,The game. The Game of Faces.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",12,You tried already. You failed.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",13,I didn't even know I was playing.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",14,Who are you?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",15,No one.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",16,Get back to work.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",17,Who are you?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",18,What are you doing here? How did you get here?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",19,I'm from Westeros just like you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",20,Daughter of a lord just like you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",21,Except I was an only child.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",22,Heir to his fortune.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",23,My mother died.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",24,My father remarried and his new wife
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",25,gave birth to a girl.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",26,"My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",27,so she tried to kill me with poison.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",28,I found out.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",29,Sought help from the Faceless Men.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",30,And my father was widowed again.

S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",34,Did you believe every word I said?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",35,Get back to work.

S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",37,Who are you?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",38,Arya.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",39,And where did you come from?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",40,<i>Westeros.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",41,My family home is Winterfell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",42,"I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",43,Eddard Stark.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",44,He died in battle.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",45,A lie.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",46,"After he was executed, I fled the capital."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",47,Had to kill a stable boy.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",48,Drove my sword through his back.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",49,A lie.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",50,I stabbed him in the gut.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",51,"<i>I tried to find</i> <i>my mother and brother,</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",52,<i>but I never did.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",53,<i>They were murdered</i> <i>by Walder Frey.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",54,"An outlaw kidnapped me, a man called Polliver."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",55,A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",56,"He tried to sell me, but was wounded in a fight."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",57,"He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",58,I left him in the mountains to die.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",59,I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",60,I hated him.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",61,That's not a lie!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",62,"A girl lies to me,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",63,"to the Many-Faced God, to herself."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",64,Does she truly want to be no one?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",65,Yes.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",66,I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",67,We never stop playing.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",68,"So, those villages we were supposed to find?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",69,We can't live on berries and roots.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",70,I can.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",71,You're not hungry?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",72,Of course I'm hungry.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",73,"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",74,Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",75,I'm not your travelling companion.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",76,"We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore--"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",77,Do you ever shut up?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",78,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",79,<i>without ever saying a word.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",80,Why?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",81,It never occurred to you to ask why until now?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",82,You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",83,decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",84,I'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",85,I killed my father.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",86,He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",87,And he was fucking the woman I loved.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",88,"As miserable as you are, Mormont,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",89,at least your father was a good man.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",90,What do you know about my father?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",91,I met him. I visited the Wall.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",92,"When I asked him about his men,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",93,"he knew all their stories, every one of them."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",94,He actually cared about the people under his command.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",95,How do they put it in the Watch?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",96,"""We shall never see his like again."""
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",97,"Oh, you didn't know."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",98,I'm sorry. I am.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",99,How?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",100,I only know what I heard.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",101,How?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",102,<i>He was leading an expedition beyond the Wall.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",103,There was a mutiny.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",104,He was murdered by his own men.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",105,We better keep moving.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",106,Valar morghulis.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",107,Valar dohaeris.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",108,I have nowhere else to go.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",109,I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",110,I've spent every penny I had.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",111,She suffers every day of her life.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",112,I just want it to end.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",113,It hurts.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",114,I know.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",115,Don't be afraid.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",116,I used to be like you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",117,I was sick.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",118,I was dying.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",119,But my father never gave up on me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",120,He loved me
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",121,"more than anything in the world,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",122,just like your father loves you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",123,So he brought me here.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",124,My father prayed to the Many-Faced God.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",125,And I drank the water from his fountain.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",126,It healed me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",127,I've devoted my life to him now.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",128,You don't want to hurt anymore?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",129,Drink.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",130,<i>Is a girl ready?</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",131,"To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",132,"<i>Her hopes and dreams,</i> <i>her loves and hates?</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",133,All that makes a girl who she is?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",134,Forever?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",135,No.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",136,A girl is not ready to become no one.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",137,But she is ready to become someone else.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",138,Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",139,"As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",140,during Robert's Rebellion.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",141,Do you believe in anything?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",142,I believe in lots of things.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",143,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",144,"The gods, destiny."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",145,Do you believe there's a plan for this world?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",146,No.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",147,Neither did I.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",148,I was a cynic just like you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",149,Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",150,with three stone eggs.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",151,"When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",152,"Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",153,"alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",154,Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",155,No.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",156,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",157,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",158,"<i>No, it doesn't.</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",159,The Targaryens are famously insane.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",160,What if she conquers the world? Then what?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",161,"1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",162,First we have to conquer the world.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",163,We?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",164,"All right, let's assume your dreams come true."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",165,<i>She's ecstatic when you</i> <i>bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",166,<i>She hacks off my head</i> <i>and restores your position.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",167,"You command her army, sail to Westeros,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",168,defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",169,and sit on the Iron Throne.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",170,Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",171,Then she rules.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",172,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",173,in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",174,- She's the rightful heir. - Why?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",175,"Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",176,- That's a slave ship. - Why are they anchored?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",177,They probably came ashore for--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",178,<i> Water.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",179,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",180,Salt mines?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",181,"Yeah, that or a galley slave."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",182,<i>He looks strong enough.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",183,What about the dwarf?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",184,Worthless.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",185,Cut his throat.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",186,"Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",187,And then chop off his cock.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",188,We'll sell it for a fortune.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",189,A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",190,Wait! Wait!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",191,"Wait, wait, wait!"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",192,You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",193,and expect him to pay for it.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",194,He has to know it came from a dwarf.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",195,And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",196,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",197,Guess again.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",198,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",199,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",200,"We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",201,"Besides, she reopened the fighting pits."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",202,I've never heard of free men fighting in the pits.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",203,<i>The fighting pits in Meereen?</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",204,"You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",205,You are looking at one of the great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",206,Him.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",207,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",208,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",209,"a bit withered, been in the sun too long."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",210,We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",211,They wrote songs about him.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",212,That true?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",213,He won the tournament at Lannisport.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",214,Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",215,The Kingslayer.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",216,Jousting. You're talking about jousting.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",217,A fancy game for fancy lads.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",218,The men who fight in the pits of Meereen will swallow him whole.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",219,I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",220,Liar.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",221,It's no lie. His name was Qotho.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",222,He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",223,"Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",224,I'll prove my worth.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",225,For my children. Money.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",226,Lord Baelish.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",227,Yes?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",228,Lancel Lannister.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",229,Brother Lancel.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",230,We abandon our family names.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",231,Quite a family to abandon.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",232,The city has changed since you were here last.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",233,"We flooded the gutters with wine,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",234,"smashed the false idols,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",235,and set the godless on the run.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",236,Well done.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",237,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",238,Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",239,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",240,You'll find there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",241,in the new King's Landing.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",242,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",243,Mine just happen to be entertaining.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",244,"Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",245,arresting the heir to Highgarden?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",246,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",247,"Of course, and the Faith were armed on your orders."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",248,The king's orders.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",249,Is the king to blame for Ser Loras's perversion?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",250,House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",251,House Tyrell won't tolerate it?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",252,"I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",253,Ser Loras was promised to me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",254,Instead he chose the company of boys.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",255,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",256,Most curious.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",257,"Lysa Arryn, for instance."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",258,Thoroughly repellant woman.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",259,Forgive me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",260,I know you're still in mourning.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",261,Lysa was a good woman.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",262,A kind woman.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",263,<i>She was neither of those things. We both know it.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",264,"Still, I pity her son."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",265,How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",266,<i>has a new father to counsel him.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",267,I know how hard it can be
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",268,to lose both your parents at such a young age.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",269,"If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights of the Vale fight for their king?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",270,Young Lord Robin heeds my advice.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",271,And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",272,Good.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",273,If there's nothing else.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",274,"There is another matter, Your Grace."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",275,Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",276,You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",277,"To my shame, I failed you."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",278,But I have found Sansa Stark.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",279,Alive and well and home again
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",280,living at Winterfell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",281,That's not possible.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",282,My sources are well placed.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",283,They tell me Roose Bolton
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",284,"plans to marry her to his son Ramsay,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",285,a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",286,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",287,"Indeed, his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",288,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",289,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",290,gives him more legitimacy in the North
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",291,than an alliance with a hated southern house.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",292,I will skin him and his bastard
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",293,like that wretch on their bloody sigil.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",294,"I would counsel patience, Your Grace."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",295,Patience?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",296,Sansa helped murder my son.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",297,Roose Bolton is a traitor.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",298,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",299,marching with his army on Winterfell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",300,Let Stannis and Roose battle.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",301,Let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",302,"And when they're done, seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",303,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",304,The weather has already begun to turn.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",305,That is why it is critical to strike soon
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",306,while the victor still licks his wounds.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",307,Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",308,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",309,"Ser Jaime, then."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",310,<i>Jaime's away on a sensitive diplomatic mission.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",311,I have no idea when he'll be back.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",312,<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",313,"The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",314,trained to battle in the ice and the snow.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",315,"Forgive me, Lord Baelish,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",316,you have a reputation as a moneylender
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",317,"and a brothel keeper, not a military man."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",318,You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",319,or a single coin from the royal treasury.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",320,What do you have to lose?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",321,A brothel keeper?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",322,And if you succeed?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",323,Name me Warden of the North.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",324,"I'll speak to the king this evening,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",325,have him issue a royal decree.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",326,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",327,And I'll know you're a man of your word
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",328,when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",329,As I said...
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",330,I live to serve.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",331,I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",332,- What if he says no? - He won't.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",333,We've waited long enough.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",334,I want you to be my wife.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",335,Now.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",336,What is it?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",337,Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",338,Or do you--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",339,We can't. Not yet.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",340,Why not?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",341,You know why not. Someone will see.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",342,You are going to be my wife.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",343,I am going to be your husband.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",344,We're allowed to walk through the gardens together.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",345,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",346,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",347,They do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",348,They make a lovely couple.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",349,A Lannister and a Martell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",350,<i>They have no idea</i> <i>how dangerous that is.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",351,We must protect them.

S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",353,You haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",354,I hope you remember how.

S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",363,I'm coming to the best part.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",364,We're trying to blend in.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",365,Don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",366,This song really is all about the ending.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",367,It can wait. There.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",368,That's the Water Gardens.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",369,"<i>And once we've got the princess, then what?</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",370,I like to improvise.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",371,That explains the golden hand.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",372,Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",373,For Oberyn.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",374,For Oberyn.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",375,"Well, she's made herself at home."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",376,Myrcella.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",377,Uncle Jaime?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",378,I--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",379,I don't understand. What are you doing here?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",380,Let's speak in private.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",381,- I am Trystane Martell. - Trystane is my intended.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",382,Excellent. Good to meet you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",383,"We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",384,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",385,Let's not do something stupid.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",386,That was something stupid.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",387,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",388,"- You hurt him! - He'll be fine, I promise."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",389,But we have to--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",390,"Oh, for fuck's sake."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",391,Take her!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",392,- You're coming with me. - I don't want to.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",393,"I wasn't asking, princess."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",394,- Ah! - Drop your weapons!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",395,<i>I am Obara Sand.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",396,Daughter of Oberyn Martell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",397,I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",398,Drop your weapons.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",399,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",400,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",401,Halt!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",402,"Oh, you can smell the shit from five miles away."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",403,"Well, why have we stopped? Go on."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",404,"Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",405,"It's theater, nothing more."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",406,"If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",407,there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",408,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",409,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",410,"Everyone knew, no one cared."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",411,But he was the king's brother.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",412,And Loras is the queen's brother.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",413,"No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",414,"- Cersei's behind it. - Yeah, of course she is."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",415,"She wants to drag our name through the dirt,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",416,put us in our place.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",417,"Get some rest, dear. You look appalling."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",418,Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",419,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",420,You must be exhausted.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",421,"Put the pen down, dear. We both know you're not writing anything."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",422,"Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued Queen of Thorns."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",423,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",424,I beg your pardon?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",425,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",426,"If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll--"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",427,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",428,I was as shocked as anyone
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",429,when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",430,"I have no love for these fanatics,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",431,but what can a Queen Mother do?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",432,Has the crown suddenly stopped needing
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",433,"the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",434,"I can assure you,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",435,our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",436,Do you expect the alliance to continue
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",437,after you've thrown our future into prison?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",438,"As I said,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",439,I didn't imprison anyone.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",440,As for your veiled threats--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",441,What veil?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",442,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",443,Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",444,I didn't trust your father.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",445,<i>I didn't particularly like him.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",446,<i>But I respected him.</i> <i>He was no fool.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",447,He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",448,rather than destroy them.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",449,House Lannister has no rival.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",450,"The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",451,Just a small hearing to determine
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",452,"whether the charges against Loras have merit,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",453,which I'm sure they don't.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",454,"Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue..."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",455,and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",456,"Good day, Lady Olenna."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",457,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",458,I don't pay attention to rumors.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",459,<i>You were said to be despondent when he died.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",460,Witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",461,even as Stannis's army closed in.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",462,He was my friend. He was my king.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",463,Wasn't Joffrey your king?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",464,"<i>He was anointed</i> <i>by the Seven, not Renly.</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",465,"I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",466,But I was forgiven by Joffrey.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",467,I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",468,"Yes, wearing Renly's armor."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",469,Why does it matter what I wore?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",470,Do you deny all the charges against you?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",471,Fornication.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",472,<i>Buggery.</i> <i>Blasphemy.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",473,Of course I deny them.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",474,You never lay with Renly Baratheon?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",475,Never.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",476,<i>Nor any other man?</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",477,Never.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",478,"That will be all, Ser Loras."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",479,"Well, I think that's quite enough of that."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",480,The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",481,You call me forward?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",482,"Yes, we have some questions for you."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",483,- I am the queen. - You are.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",484,"And according to the law of the Seven,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",485,neither kings nor queens are exempt
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",486,from testimony at a holy inquest.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",487,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",488,They are lies.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",489,- All of them? - All of them.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",490,"<i>Queen Margaery,</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",491,"<i>in the presence of the gods,</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",492,do you swear that your brother is innocent
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",493,of these charges against him
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",494,to the best of your knowledge?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",495,"Yes, I swear it."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",496,"Thank you, Your Grace."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",497,Do you know this man?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",498,"Yes, very well."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",499,"<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,</i> <i>heir to Highgarden.</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",500,How did you come to meet?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",501,<i>I squired for him.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",502,He took a liking to me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",503,He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",504,And what occurred in his chamber?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",505,We engaged in intimate relations.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",506,You lay with him?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",507,That night and many others.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",508,Liar. He's a liar.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",509,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",510,Yes.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",511,"Yes, Queen Margaery."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",512,<i>She walked in on us once</i> <i>not long ago.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",513,She didn't seem surprised.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",514,This testimony is an insult to a great house.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",515,Why should the Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",516,over the heir to Highgarden?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",517,"<i> He has a birthmark, Your Grace.</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",518,<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",519,Wine-colored and roughly the shape of Dorne.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",520,No! Liar!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",521,What are you doing? Let us pass.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",522,The Faith is satisfied there is enough evidence
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",523,to bring a formal trial
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",524,<i>for Ser Loras</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",525,and Queen Margaery.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",526,What?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",527,Bearing false witness before the gods
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",528,"<i>is as grave a sin</i> <i>as any, my lady.</i>"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",529,Take her.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",530,<i>No. Tommen.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",531,Tommen!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",532,You can't do this. I am the queen.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",533,Tommen! Tommen!
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",534,<i>I am your queen.</i> <i>How dare you?</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",535,<i>Take your hands off me!</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",536,<i>Tommen!</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",537,What do you want?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",538,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you a bath, my lady."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",539,You want to be clean and fresh
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",540,"for your new husband, don't you?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",541,"You're so beautiful,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",542,but you need to keep him happy.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",543,Ramsay gets bored easily.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",544,You don't want to end up like--
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",545,"well, like the others."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",546,What others?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",547,I shouldn't gossip.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",548,"Oh, it's good to see the red again."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",549,No point hiding anymore.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",550,What others?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",551,"Let's see, there was Kyra"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",552,the blacksmith's daughter.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",553,"She was tall like you, lovely figure."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",554,But she talked and talked and talked
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",555,and Ramsay grew tired of that.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",556,Then there was Violet.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",557,She had gorgeous blonde hair.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",558,But she got pregnant.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",559,"And, well, that was boring."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",560,Then Tansy.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",561,Such a sweet girl.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",562,"Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",563,"after a while, don't they?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",564,Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",565,Hunt?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",566,Mmm.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",567,Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",568,Not so pretty.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",569,"But, well, it's your wedding day."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",570,Why am I talking about such things?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",571,What was your name again?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",572,Myranda.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",573,"And how long have yo loved him, Myranda?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",574,"Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",575,And I came along and ruined it.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",576,I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",577,This is my home and you can't frighten me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",578,"Are you done with your bath, my lady?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",579,Go. I can finish on my own.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",580,Yes?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",581,"I've come to escort you to the godswood, my lady."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",582,"If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",583,No.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",584,"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",585,I'm not touching you.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",586,Please.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",587,He'll punish me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",588,You think I care what he does to you?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",589,Who comes before the old gods this night?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",590,Sansa of the House Stark
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",591,comes here to be wed.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",592,"A woman grown, trueborn and noble."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",593,She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",594,Who comes to claim her?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",595,Ramsay of House Bolton.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",596,<i>Heir to the Dreadfort</i> <i>and Winterfell.</i>
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",597,Who gives her?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",598,"Theon of House Greyjoy, who was--"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",599,who was her father's ward.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",600,"Lady Sansa, will you take this man?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",601,I take this man.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",602,"Are you pleased, my lady?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",603,Good. I want you to be happy.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",604,My father said you're still a virgin.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",605,"- Uh, yes. - Why?"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",606,Why are you still a virgin?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",607,Afraid of dwarves?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",608,Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",609,He was gentle. He never touched me.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",610,You're not lying to me?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",611,"No, my lord."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",612,"Lying to your husband on his wedding night,"
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",613,that would be a bad way to start a marriage.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",614,We're man and wife now.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",615,We should be honest with each other.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",616,Don't you think?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",617,Yes.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",618,Good.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",619,Take off your clothes.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",620,"Oh, no, no, no."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",621,"You stay here, Reek."
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",622,You watch.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",623,Do I need to ask a second time?
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",624,I hate asking a second time.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",625,Reek...
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",626,I told you to watch.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",627,You've known Sansa since she was a girl.
S05E06,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",628,Now watch her become a woman.

S05E07,The Gift,2,"First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
S05E07,The Gift,3,"Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you"
S05E07,The Gift,4,"I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy,"
S05E07,The Gift,5,and an insult to all the brothers
S05E07,The Gift,6,who have died fighting the wildlings.
S05E07,The Gift,7,"As always, thank you for your honesty."
S05E07,The Gift,8,"Safe travels, Lord Commander."
S05E07,The Gift,9,"Thank you, Sam."
S05E07,The Gift,10,"Oh, um..."
S05E07,The Gift,11,It's dragonglass.
S05E07,The Gift,12,It's what I used to kill the white walker.
S05E07,The Gift,13,I hope you don't need them.
S05E07,The Gift,14,"Me, too."
S05E07,The Gift,15,Yah.
S05E07,The Gift,16,There he is.
S05E07,The Gift,17,That laugh.
S05E07,The Gift,18,<i>Egg.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,19,<i>Egg laughed like that.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,20,<i>One of the first things I remember.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,21,His little brother Aegon. He became king.
S05E07,The Gift,22,"And before that, he was a jolly fellow,"
S05E07,The Gift,23,like this one.
S05E07,The Gift,24,"Get him south, Gillyflower."
S05E07,The Gift,25,Before it's too late.
S05E07,The Gift,26,"Theon, wait."
S05E07,The Gift,27,"Not Theon, my lady. Reek."
S05E07,The Gift,28,Help me.
S05E07,The Gift,29,You're his wife now.
S05E07,The Gift,30,Theon.
S05E07,The Gift,31,Do what he says.
S05E07,The Gift,32,Do what he says or he'll hurt you.
S05E07,The Gift,33,He already hurts me every night.
S05E07,The Gift,34,All day I'm locked in this room
S05E07,The Gift,35,and every night he comes...
S05E07,The Gift,36,It can't be any worse.
S05E07,The Gift,37,It can. It can always be worse.
S05E07,The Gift,38,- What did he do to you? - Please.
S05E07,The Gift,39,- You betrayed my family! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
S05E07,The Gift,40,"You have to help me. Theon, help me."
S05E07,The Gift,41,He'll see us. You don't know him.
S05E07,The Gift,42,My family still has friends in the North.
S05E07,The Gift,43,All I need to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me.
S05E07,The Gift,44,Climb to the top of the broken tower.
S05E07,The Gift,45,Light this candle and put it in the window.
S05E07,The Gift,46,"- Promise me, Theon. - Reek! My name is Reek."
S05E07,The Gift,47,Your name is Theon Greyjoy.
S05E07,The Gift,48,"Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,"
S05E07,The Gift,49,Lord of the Iron Islands.
S05E07,The Gift,50,Do you hear me?
S05E07,The Gift,51,Theon...
S05E07,The Gift,52,promise me.
S05E07,The Gift,53,"Yes, Reek?"
S05E07,The Gift,54,<i>Egg.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,55,Egg.
S05E07,The Gift,56,Mother's looking for you.
S05E07,The Gift,57,Egg.
S05E07,The Gift,58,"Get some sleep, Sam."
S05E07,The Gift,59,You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.
S05E07,The Gift,60,You don't know that.
S05E07,The Gift,61,Get some sleep.
S05E07,The Gift,62,I'll watch over him.
S05E07,The Gift,63,"I'm staying, too."
S05E07,The Gift,64,He's always been good to me.
S05E07,The Gift,65,I can't leave him now.
S05E07,The Gift,66,Egg!
S05E07,The Gift,67,Egg.
S05E07,The Gift,68,I dreamed...
S05E07,The Gift,69,that I was old.
S05E07,The Gift,70,<i>His name was Aemon Targaryen.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,71,<i>He came to us from King's Landing.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,72,"<i>A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn,</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,73,"<i>and sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful.</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,74,<i>No man was wiser</i>
S05E07,The Gift,75,<i>or gentler or kinder.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,76,"At the Wall, a dozen lord commanders"
S05E07,The Gift,77,"came and went during his years of service,"
S05E07,The Gift,78,but he was always there to counsel them.
S05E07,The Gift,79,He was the blood of the dragon...
S05E07,The Gift,80,but now his fire has gone out.
S05E07,The Gift,81,And now his watch is ended.
S05E07,The Gift,82,And now his watch is ended.
S05E07,The Gift,83,"You're losing all your friends, Tarly."
S05E07,The Gift,84,My beautiful wife.
S05E07,The Gift,85,"When my father told me we were marrying,"
S05E07,The Gift,86,"I half expected a fat, bearded beast."
S05E07,The Gift,87,Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you?
S05E07,The Gift,88,You've made me very happy.
S05E07,The Gift,89,Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell.
S05E07,The Gift,90,He's a respected commander.
S05E07,The Gift,91,His troops are loyal and battle-tested.
S05E07,The Gift,92,He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords to bolster his army.
S05E07,The Gift,93,But this storm is a stroke of luck for us northerners.
S05E07,The Gift,94,Our people are used to fighting in the frost.
S05E07,The Gift,95,His army is out there now suffering in the snow.
S05E07,The Gift,96,One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell
S05E07,The Gift,97,and Warden of the North.
S05E07,The Gift,98,You'll be my lady and Wardeness.
S05E07,The Gift,99,But isn't your stepmother pregnant?
S05E07,The Gift,100,What of it?
S05E07,The Gift,101,What happens if she has a boy?
S05E07,The Gift,102,Then I'll have a baby brother.
S05E07,The Gift,103,But he'll be the heir.
S05E07,The Gift,104,I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.
S05E07,The Gift,105,But you're a bastard.
S05E07,The Gift,106,A trueborn will always have the stronger claim.
S05E07,The Gift,107,I've been naturalized by a royal decree from...
S05E07,The Gift,108,Tommen Baratheon? Another bastard.
S05E07,The Gift,109,Bastards can rise high in the world.
S05E07,The Gift,110,Like your half-brother Jon Snow.
S05E07,The Gift,111,"Born the bastard of Winterfell,"
S05E07,The Gift,112,now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S05E07,The Gift,113,You didn't know?
S05E07,The Gift,114,"Yes, he's done very well for himself."
S05E07,The Gift,115,Oh.
S05E07,The Gift,116,I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.
S05E07,The Gift,117,"Come, my lady."
S05E07,The Gift,118,<i>Your northern friend.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,119,Reek told me you wanted to leave.
S05E07,The Gift,120,Why?
S05E07,The Gift,121,Winterfell is your home
S05E07,The Gift,122,and I am your husband.
S05E07,The Gift,123,Tough old bird.
S05E07,The Gift,124,Everyone talks when I start peeling them.
S05E07,The Gift,125,"But this one,"
S05E07,The Gift,126,her heart gave out before I even got to her face.
S05E07,The Gift,127,We do breed them tough in the North.
S05E07,The Gift,128,Bring my wife back to her chamber.
S05E07,The Gift,129,It's far too cold out here for a lady.
S05E07,The Gift,130,You should hold on to your candles.
S05E07,The Gift,131,The nights are so long now.
S05E07,The Gift,132,<i>40 horses died in the night.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,133,We'll lose more come sunset.
S05E07,The Gift,134,We're running out of food.
S05E07,The Gift,135,We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.
S05E07,The Gift,136,What else?
S05E07,The Gift,137,The Stormcrows rode off last night.
S05E07,The Gift,138,500 men.
S05E07,The Gift,139,Sellswords.
S05E07,The Gift,140,Loyal to nothing but gold.
S05E07,The Gift,141,We still have a hard march to Winterfell
S05E07,The Gift,142,and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.
S05E07,The Gift,143,And?
S05E07,The Gift,144,This isn't our time.
S05E07,The Gift,145,We should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.
S05E07,The Gift,146,"I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos."
S05E07,The Gift,147,"If I retreat again, I'll become the King Who Ran."
S05E07,The Gift,148,- Your Grace... - Winter is coming.
S05E07,The Gift,149,Those aren't just the Stark words. It's a fact.
S05E07,The Gift,150,"If we march back to Castle Black,"
S05E07,The Gift,151,we winter at Castle Black.
S05E07,The Gift,152,And who can say how many years
S05E07,The Gift,153,this winter will last?
S05E07,The Gift,154,It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything.
S05E07,The Gift,155,This is the right time and I will risk everything.
S05E07,The Gift,156,"Because if I don't, we've lost."
S05E07,The Gift,157,We march to victory
S05E07,The Gift,158,or we march to defeat.
S05E07,The Gift,159,But we go forward. Only forward.
S05E07,The Gift,160,Your Grace.
S05E07,The Gift,161,I've trusted in your visions
S05E07,The Gift,162,and your prophecies for years.
S05E07,The Gift,163,"You saw it yourself, my king,"
S05E07,The Gift,164,when you stared into the flames.
S05E07,The Gift,165,<i>A great battle in the snow.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,166,- I don't know what I saw. - <i>You do know.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,167,Trust yourself.
S05E07,The Gift,168,And you? Do you trust yourself?
S05E07,The Gift,169,I trust in the Lord.
S05E07,The Gift,170,Are you sure?
S05E07,The Gift,171,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell.
S05E07,The Gift,172,I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground.
S05E07,The Gift,173,But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.
S05E07,The Gift,174,I have shown you the power of king's blood.
S05E07,The Gift,175,The usurper Robb Stark.
S05E07,The Gift,176,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
S05E07,The Gift,177,We don't have Robert's bastard here.
S05E07,The Gift,178,"No, we have someone better."
S05E07,The Gift,179,And your blood runs through her veins.
S05E07,The Gift,180,Have you lost your mind?
S05E07,The Gift,181,Do you doubt me?
S05E07,The Gift,182,Still?
S05E07,The Gift,183,After all that you've seen.
S05E07,The Gift,184,There must be another way.
S05E07,The Gift,185,- Leeches or... - There is only one way.
S05E07,The Gift,186,You must become king before the Long Night begins.
S05E07,The Gift,187,Only you can lead the living against the dead.
S05E07,The Gift,188,All your life has led us to this moment.
S05E07,The Gift,189,- To this decision. - She's my daughter.
S05E07,The Gift,190,Get out.
S05E07,The Gift,191,There's always some sort of grub on.
S05E07,The Gift,192,A bit of mutton would be nice.
S05E07,The Gift,193,A beauty from beyond the Wall.
S05E07,The Gift,194,"Where you going, love? Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?"
S05E07,The Gift,195,"No, the question is is she pretty down south in the real world"
S05E07,The Gift,196,or is she pretty 'cause she's the only girl here?
S05E07,The Gift,197,"Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss."
S05E07,The Gift,198,"Come on, love, give us a kiss."
S05E07,The Gift,199,"- Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone."
S05E07,The Gift,200,"- One little kiss. - Come on, give him a kiss."
S05E07,The Gift,201,A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.
S05E07,The Gift,202,There's no need to be rude.
S05E07,The Gift,203,We just want a little affection.
S05E07,The Gift,204,Ooh.
S05E07,The Gift,205,Get your hands off her.
S05E07,The Gift,206,"Brother Derek, Brother Brant,"
S05E07,The Gift,207,I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
S05E07,The Gift,208,Sam the Slayer.
S05E07,The Gift,209,You gonna slay me with that sword?
S05E07,The Gift,210,<i>Look at his hand shake.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,211,"Gilly, go on."
S05E07,The Gift,212,"Get back to your room, lock the door."
S05E07,The Gift,213,- I'm warning you. - Come on.
S05E07,The Gift,214,Come on.
S05E07,The Gift,215,Sam!
S05E07,The Gift,216,You lying sack of shit.
S05E07,The Gift,217,"<i>Killed a white walker, eh?</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,218,You fat-ass fuck.
S05E07,The Gift,219,"Come on, get up."
S05E07,The Gift,220,<i>- No! - This your hero? This hog?</i>
S05E07,The Gift,221,Leave him alone!
S05E07,The Gift,222,"Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you?"
S05E07,The Gift,223,- Come on! - No!
S05E07,The Gift,224,- Sam! Sam! Sam! - Come on!
S05E07,The Gift,225,- Sam! Sam! - Come on.
S05E07,The Gift,226,<i>- Right.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,227,<i>I'll deal with this.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,228,<i>- Turn her over. - All right.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,229,I said get your hands off her.
S05E07,The Gift,230,You're gonna get yourself killed.
S05E07,The Gift,231,Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you.
S05E07,The Gift,232,"I killed a white walker, I killed a Thenn."
S05E07,The Gift,233,I'll take my chances with you.
S05E07,The Gift,234,<i>Sam!</i>
S05E07,The Gift,235,- I'm all right. - You're not.
S05E07,The Gift,236,Just a bit woozy.
S05E07,The Gift,237,"The next time you see something like that, you leave it alone."
S05E07,The Gift,238,<i>I will not. They would have...</i>
S05E07,The Gift,239,I don't know what they would have done.
S05E07,The Gift,240,I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.
S05E07,The Gift,241,"No. No, no. They were tiring out."
S05E07,The Gift,242,I had them in the palm of my hand.
S05E07,The Gift,243,"Don't be stupid, Sam."
S05E07,The Gift,244,You're not a fighter.
S05E07,The Gift,245,What kind of man would I be
S05E07,The Gift,246,if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
S05E07,The Gift,247,Just promise me
S05E07,The Gift,248,"whatever happens, you'll take care of Little Sam."
S05E07,The Gift,249,But of course I will.
S05E07,The Gift,250,And...
S05E07,The Gift,251,"I'll take care of you, too."
S05E07,The Gift,252,I need more water.
S05E07,The Gift,253,Stay.
S05E07,The Gift,254,<i>Please?</i>
S05E07,The Gift,255,Am I hurting you?
S05E07,The Gift,256,Are you sure?
S05E07,The Gift,257,"Oh, my!"
S05E07,The Gift,258,"<i>A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends.</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,259,Not your usual street tough or drunken pirate.
S05E07,The Gift,260,This one's a Westerosi knight
S05E07,The Gift,261,from an ancient house trained in sword and lance.
S05E07,The Gift,262,He fought beside the stag king Robert
S05E07,The Gift,263,on the far side of the Narrow Sea.
S05E07,The Gift,264,"He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike,"
S05E07,The Gift,265,slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.
S05E07,The Gift,266,He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat.
S05E07,The Gift,267,"Betrayed by his woman,"
S05E07,The Gift,268,he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts.
S05E07,The Gift,269,<i>- Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,270,13. Do I have 14?
S05E07,The Gift,271,15? 15 gold honors.
S05E07,The Gift,272,Do I hear 16? 16?
S05E07,The Gift,273,20.
S05E07,The Gift,274,Sold.
S05E07,The Gift,275,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
S05E07,The Gift,276,Why?
S05E07,The Gift,277,We're a team.
S05E07,The Gift,278,"I'm a great fighter, too."
S05E07,The Gift,279,He's funny. You have to give him that.
S05E07,The Gift,280,"You're right, he's funny."
S05E07,The Gift,281,"Thank you, my lord. Thank you."
S05E07,The Gift,282,Yes.
S05E07,The Gift,283,"My lord, if I may."
S05E07,The Gift,284,I've heard Meereen has become a free city.
S05E07,The Gift,285,You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits.
S05E07,The Gift,286,"Now, if you were to fight freed men who'd be paid a wage..."
S05E07,The Gift,287,"There's your wages, funny man."
S05E07,The Gift,288,Should last the rest of your life.
S05E07,The Gift,289,"These are warrior hands, not a serving girl's."
S05E07,The Gift,290,"5, going once..."
S05E07,The Gift,291,How long before the King of Meereen comes to claim my pillow?
S05E07,The Gift,292,Don't be ridiculous.
S05E07,The Gift,293,My marriage to Hizdahr is political.
S05E07,The Gift,294,I think he's smart enough to understand that.
S05E07,The Gift,295,I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing
S05E07,The Gift,296,because their leader was made king.
S05E07,The Gift,297,Are you jealous?
S05E07,The Gift,298,You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man
S05E07,The Gift,299,just because he represents competition?
S05E07,The Gift,300,I do.
S05E07,The Gift,301,You're right.
S05E07,The Gift,302,My motivations are entirely impure.
S05E07,The Gift,303,Doesn't make me wrong.
S05E07,The Gift,304,You told me yourself I can't fight enemies within and without.
S05E07,The Gift,305,"So when enemies without come knocking,"
S05E07,The Gift,306,I need the city of Meereen behind me.
S05E07,The Gift,307,I have no choice.
S05E07,The Gift,308,Everyone has a choice.
S05E07,The Gift,309,Even slaves have a choice...
S05E07,The Gift,310,Death or slavery.
S05E07,The Gift,311,"So what else can I do, hmm?"
S05E07,The Gift,312,Marry me instead.
S05E07,The Gift,313,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadvisable thing,"
S05E07,The Gift,314,I couldn't.
S05E07,The Gift,315,Why not?
S05E07,The Gift,316,You are queen. You can do what you like.
S05E07,The Gift,317,"No, I can't."
S05E07,The Gift,318,Then you are the only person in Meereen who's not free.
S05E07,The Gift,319,"And I know I'm here to serve my queen and not give advice,"
S05E07,The Gift,320,but can I make one more suggestion?
S05E07,The Gift,321,Of course.
S05E07,The Gift,322,"On the day of the great games,"
S05E07,The Gift,323,gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters
S05E07,The Gift,324,and Worthy Masters you can find
S05E07,The Gift,325,and slaughter them all.
S05E07,The Gift,326,"I am a queen, not a butcher."
S05E07,The Gift,327,All rulers are either butchers or meat.
S05E07,The Gift,328,You there. Where would I find the High Septon
S05E07,The Gift,329,or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he's got?
S05E07,The Gift,330,"It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit."
S05E07,The Gift,331,You should have the decency
S05E07,The Gift,332,to stand when you speak to a lady.
S05E07,The Gift,333,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods.
S05E07,The Gift,334,"Don't spar with me, little fellow."
S05E07,The Gift,335,"For me, it's the knees."
S05E07,The Gift,336,- You? - Hips.
S05E07,The Gift,337,Ah.
S05E07,The Gift,338,A man of the people. Is that your game?
S05E07,The Gift,339,It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.
S05E07,The Gift,340,A man of the people
S05E07,The Gift,341,who does Cersei's dirty work for her.
S05E07,The Gift,342,The people always do the dirty work.
S05E07,The Gift,343,Spare me the homilies. I can smell a fraud from a mile away.
S05E07,The Gift,344,Useful talent.
S05E07,The Gift,345,I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
S05E07,The Gift,346,Your grandson and granddaughter
S05E07,The Gift,347,swore sacred vows and lied.
S05E07,The Gift,348,The Father judges us all.
S05E07,The Gift,349,"Sons of high lords,"
S05E07,The Gift,350,sons of fishermen.
S05E07,The Gift,351,"If you break his laws, you will be punished."
S05E07,The Gift,352,Don't you walk away from me.
S05E07,The Gift,353,"You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna."
S05E07,The Gift,354,What is it you want?
S05E07,The Gift,355,Gold?
S05E07,The Gift,356,I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
S05E07,The Gift,357,"What, then?"
S05E07,The Gift,358,I imagine this is strange for you.
S05E07,The Gift,359,Everyone you meet has a hidden motive
S05E07,The Gift,360,and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.
S05E07,The Gift,361,<i>But I'm telling you a simple truth.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,362,I serve the gods.
S05E07,The Gift,363,The gods demand justice.
S05E07,The Gift,364,How do they communicate their demands?
S05E07,The Gift,365,By raven or horse?
S05E07,The Gift,366,"By the holy text, ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
S05E07,The Gift,367,"If you don't have one in your library,"
S05E07,The Gift,368,<i>I'll give you my own.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,369,"I've read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
S05E07,The Gift,370,<i>Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,371,Your grandchildren will be punished
S05E07,The Gift,372,in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
S05E07,The Gift,373,"Half the men, women, and children"
S05E07,The Gift,374,in this foul city break the sacred laws.
S05E07,The Gift,375,"You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists,"
S05E07,The Gift,376,and yet you punish Loras
S05E07,The Gift,377,for shagging some perfumed ponce
S05E07,The Gift,378,and Margaery for defending her brother?
S05E07,The Gift,379,Yes. The gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
S05E07,The Gift,380,"If it's equality you want, so be it."
S05E07,The Gift,381,"When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital,"
S05E07,The Gift,382,everyone here will starve.
S05E07,The Gift,383,And I'll make sure the hungry know who's to blame.
S05E07,The Gift,384,"Have you ever sowed the field, Lady Olenna?"
S05E07,The Gift,385,Have you ever reaped the grain?
S05E07,The Gift,386,Has anyone in House Tyrell?
S05E07,The Gift,387,A lifetime of wealth and power
S05E07,The Gift,388,has left you blind in one eye.
S05E07,The Gift,389,"You are the few, we are the many."
S05E07,The Gift,390,And when the many stop fearing the few...
S05E07,The Gift,391,Lady Olenna.
S05E07,The Gift,392,Starving yourself won't make things
S05E07,The Gift,393,"any better for her, my love."
S05E07,The Gift,394,She's in a prison cell
S05E07,The Gift,395,and there is nothing I can do.
S05E07,The Gift,396,I am the king!
S05E07,The Gift,397,The queen is in prison and there is nothing I can do!
S05E07,The Gift,398,"No matter who you are,"
S05E07,The Gift,399,"no matter how strong you are, sooner or later,"
S05E07,The Gift,400,you'll face circumstances beyond your control.
S05E07,The Gift,401,Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated
S05E07,The Gift,402,or prevented even if you had.
S05E07,The Gift,403,You cannot blame yourself for fate.
S05E07,The Gift,404,"Your father,"
S05E07,The Gift,405,"your brother, your grandfather..."
S05E07,The Gift,406,I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do?
S05E07,The Gift,407,Hold them as they left this world.
S05E07,The Gift,408,Kissed their heads after they'd gone.
S05E07,The Gift,409,I'll call in the army.
S05E07,The Gift,410,I'll take back the sept
S05E07,The Gift,411,and kill every last one of them.
S05E07,The Gift,412,I'll start a war if I have to.
S05E07,The Gift,413,You know as well as I do who the first casualty of that war would be.
S05E07,The Gift,414,I love her.
S05E07,The Gift,415,I love her...
S05E07,The Gift,416,and I can't help her.
S05E07,The Gift,417,We must be strong for those we love.
S05E07,The Gift,418,We cannot give in to despair.
S05E07,The Gift,419,I will speak with the High Sparrow.
S05E07,The Gift,420,There must be something he...
S05E07,The Gift,421,Let me talk to him on your behalf.
S05E07,The Gift,422,The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
S05E07,The Gift,423,You will try to help her?
S05E07,The Gift,424,I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.
S05E07,The Gift,425,Your happiness is all I want in this world.
S05E07,The Gift,426,"- I know. - No, you don't."
S05E07,The Gift,427,You can't possibly.
S05E07,The Gift,428,Not until you have children of your own.
S05E07,The Gift,429,I would do anything for you.
S05E07,The Gift,430,Anything to keep you from harm.
S05E07,The Gift,431,I would burn cities to the ground.
S05E07,The Gift,432,You are all that matters.
S05E07,The Gift,433,You and your sister.
S05E07,The Gift,434,From the moment you came into this world.
S05E07,The Gift,435,My boy.
S05E07,The Gift,436,My only boy.
S05E07,The Gift,437,Prince Doran hopes this satisfies
S05E07,The Gift,438,your concerns about the princess's well-being.
S05E07,The Gift,439,You looked different when I left.
S05E07,The Gift,440,You had more hair.
S05E07,The Gift,441,And more hands.
S05E07,The Gift,442,- How's Trystane? - He'll be all right.
S05E07,The Gift,443,I'm sorry for that.
S05E07,The Gift,444,It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
S05E07,The Gift,445,Why is it happening at all?
S05E07,The Gift,446,Your mother's worried about you.
S05E07,The Gift,447,Threats have been made.
S05E07,The Gift,448,Dorne's too dangerous for you.
S05E07,The Gift,449,- I've come to take you home. - This is my home.
S05E07,The Gift,450,This has been my home for years.
S05E07,The Gift,451,"I didn't want to come here, but she told me to."
S05E07,The Gift,452,I did what she said.
S05E07,The Gift,453,I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?
S05E07,The Gift,454,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
S05E07,The Gift,455,"<i>No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple.</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,456,"I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,"
S05E07,The Gift,457,and we're staying right here.
S05E07,The Gift,458,- I don't understand. - Of course you don't.
S05E07,The Gift,459,You don't know me.
S05E07,The Gift,460,"<i>♪ Brothers, O brothers, my days here are done ♪</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,461,<i>♪ The Dornishman's taken my life ♪</i>
S05E07,The Gift,462,♪ But what does it matter ♪
S05E07,The Gift,463,♪ For all men must die
S05E07,The Gift,464,♪ And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife ♪
S05E07,The Gift,465,"♪ I have, I've tasted the Dornishman's wife. ♪"
S05E07,The Gift,466,He's got a good voice.
S05E07,The Gift,467,We're lucky he's a singer.
S05E07,The Gift,468,"If he were a fighter, we might have been in trouble."
S05E07,The Gift,469,It's against my code to hurt a woman.
S05E07,The Gift,470,It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
S05E07,The Gift,471,I wouldn't say you beat me.
S05E07,The Gift,472,How's your arm?
S05E07,The Gift,473,Wonderful.
S05E07,The Gift,474,Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
S05E07,The Gift,475,You think you're leaving Dorne?
S05E07,The Gift,476,No great hurry.
S05E07,The Gift,477,Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
S05E07,The Gift,478,Thank you.
S05E07,The Gift,479,I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.
S05E07,The Gift,480,I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
S05E07,The Gift,481,<i>I've seen quite a few women</i>
S05E07,The Gift,482,<i>in all the Seven Kingdoms.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,483,Name one more beautiful than I am.
S05E07,The Gift,484,"Well, now, in King's Landing,"
S05E07,The Gift,485,<i>there was an absolutely gorgeous...</i>
S05E07,The Gift,486,There was a what?
S05E07,The Gift,487,"In King's Landing, you were saying?"
S05E07,The Gift,488,Was I?
S05E07,The Gift,489,There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
S05E07,The Gift,490,Was there?
S05E07,The Gift,491,My memory's not what it was earlier.
S05E07,The Gift,492,How's your arm now?
S05E07,The Gift,493,You seem concerned with it.
S05E07,The Gift,494,<i>You must really like me.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,495,And how about your head?
S05E07,The Gift,496,<i>My head?</i>
S05E07,The Gift,497,My head?
S05E07,The Gift,498,You don't even want to know what's going on in...
S05E07,The Gift,499,Your nose is bleeding.
S05E07,The Gift,500,It's nothing. It's the dry air.
S05E07,The Gift,501,My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshai.
S05E07,The Gift,502,<i>They call it the Long Farewell.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,503,"It takes time to work,"
S05E07,The Gift,504,"but if a single drop makes contact with the skin,"
S05E07,The Gift,505,death.
S05E07,The Gift,506,The only antidote.
S05E07,The Gift,507,Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
S05E07,The Gift,508,You.
S05E07,The Gift,509,Sorry? Who?
S05E07,The Gift,510,You.
S05E07,The Gift,511,Don't drop it.
S05E07,The Gift,512,I think you're very handsome as well.
S05E07,The Gift,513,"- I'm sorry about the locale. - No, you're not."
S05E07,The Gift,514,It felt like the safest place.
S05E07,The Gift,515,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
S05E07,The Gift,516,It was an establishment like no other.
S05E07,The Gift,517,The sheer range of appetites catered to.
S05E07,The Gift,518,Desires that didn't even exist
S05E07,The Gift,519,until we invented them.
S05E07,The Gift,520,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
S05E07,The Gift,521,The past is the past.
S05E07,The Gift,522,The future is all that's worth discussing.
S05E07,The Gift,523,The future of House Tyrell.
S05E07,The Gift,524,"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house,"
S05E07,The Gift,525,my grandchildren or me.
S05E07,The Gift,526,I should have known you'd return to the capital
S05E07,The Gift,527,as soon as things started to go wrong.
S05E07,The Gift,528,"- I promise you... - I promise you, Lord Baelish,"
S05E07,The Gift,529,that our fates are joined.
S05E07,The Gift,530,Together we murdered a king.
S05E07,The Gift,531,"If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide."
S05E07,The Gift,532,And if I should meet with some accident
S05E07,The Gift,533,"here at your broken little flesh market,"
S05E07,The Gift,534,they'll never even find what's left of you.
S05E07,The Gift,535,So...
S05E07,The Gift,536,do you deny a part in all this?
S05E07,The Gift,537,Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.
S05E07,The Gift,538,I dared not refuse her.
S05E07,The Gift,539,And what did she want?
S05E07,The Gift,540,A piece of information she knew that I had.
S05E07,The Gift,541,Neither silence nor lies were an option.
S05E07,The Gift,542,But I have other information
S05E07,The Gift,543,of which she is unaware.
S05E07,The Gift,544,"And as you say, our interests are aligned."
S05E07,The Gift,545,I have a gift for you.
S05E07,The Gift,546,What kind of gift?
S05E07,The Gift,547,The same kind I gave Cersei.
S05E07,The Gift,548,A handsome young man.
S05E07,The Gift,549,<i>Many worthy fighters have died</i>
S05E07,The Gift,550,<i>trying to make it to the great games.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,551,"When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon,"
S05E07,The Gift,552,it will represent a significant rise in your station.
S05E07,The Gift,553,"But if you do happen to triumph here,"
S05E07,The Gift,554,<i>you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself</i>
S05E07,The Gift,555,<i>in front of the queen.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,556,"So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today."
S05E07,The Gift,557,This is the day your lives actually start to mean something.
S05E07,The Gift,558,You and you. You.
S05E07,The Gift,559,You two.
S05E07,The Gift,560,"<i>You, you, and you.</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,561,Up.
S05E07,The Gift,562,<i>- Valar morghulis. - Valar dohaeris.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,563,Prepare yourselves.
S05E07,The Gift,564,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
S05E07,The Gift,565,"For generations in the days leading up to the great games,"
S05E07,The Gift,566,it has been customary for our ruler
S05E07,The Gift,567,to make the rounds of the lower pits
S05E07,The Gift,568,to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.
S05E07,The Gift,569,<i>Move yourselves.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,570,Your Grace.
S05E07,The Gift,571,Your future Grace.
S05E07,The Gift,572,You honor us all.
S05E07,The Gift,573,Stand there.
S05E07,The Gift,574,Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.
S05E07,The Gift,575,"We fight and die for your glory,"
S05E07,The Gift,576,O glorious queen.
S05E07,The Gift,577,"We fight and die for your glory,"
S05E07,The Gift,578,<i>O glorious queen.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,579,<i>Fight!</i>
S05E07,The Gift,580,I think I've seen enough.
S05E07,The Gift,581,"Your Grace, it is a tradition"
S05E07,The Gift,582,for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.
S05E07,The Gift,583,I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
S05E07,The Gift,584,What are you doing?
S05E07,The Gift,585,"Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth."
S05E07,The Gift,586,Get him out of my sight.
S05E07,The Gift,587,"Khaleesi, please."
S05E07,The Gift,588,I just need a moment of your time.
S05E07,The Gift,589,I brought you a gift.
S05E07,The Gift,590,<i>It's true.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,591,He has.
S05E07,The Gift,592,Who are you?
S05E07,The Gift,593,I am the gift.
S05E07,The Gift,594,"<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,595,My name is Tyrion Lannister.
S05E07,The Gift,596,This is horrible.
S05E07,The Gift,597,Unacceptable.
S05E07,The Gift,598,Are they feeding you enough at least?
S05E07,The Gift,599,I brought you this. Venison.
S05E07,The Gift,600,It's quite good.
S05E07,The Gift,601,I had it myself for supper only last night.
S05E07,The Gift,602,We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother.
S05E07,The Gift,603,Tommen even went to the sept himself
S05E07,The Gift,604,to confront the High Sparrow.
S05E07,The Gift,605,But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.
S05E07,The Gift,606,I know you did this.
S05E07,The Gift,607,We are making every effort on your behalf.
S05E07,The Gift,608,I swear to you by all the seven gods.
S05E07,The Gift,609,Lies come easily to you.
S05E07,The Gift,610,Everyone knows that.
S05E07,The Gift,611,"<i>But innocence,</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,612,"<i>decency, concern,</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,613,"you're not very good at those, I'm afraid."
S05E07,The Gift,614,Perhaps that's why your son was so eager
S05E07,The Gift,615,to cast you aside for me.
S05E07,The Gift,616,You're upset.
S05E07,The Gift,617,You're not thinking clearly.
S05E07,The Gift,618,I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
S05E07,The Gift,619,I don't want to see you again.
S05E07,The Gift,620,I do hope you change your mind about that.
S05E07,The Gift,621,I've been told men often go mad
S05E07,The Gift,622,in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.
S05E07,The Gift,623,Though I suppose your isolation will end
S05E07,The Gift,624,when your trial begins.
S05E07,The Gift,625,Leave.
S05E07,The Gift,626,Yes.
S05E07,The Gift,627,I'm afraid I must.
S05E07,The Gift,628,<i>My son needs me now more than ever.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,629,"Get out, you hateful bitch!"
S05E07,The Gift,630,"Sleep well, sister."
S05E07,The Gift,631,"Thank you, Boake."
S05E07,The Gift,632,- You saw her? - Yes.
S05E07,The Gift,633,- And? - Her accommodations seem sufficient.
S05E07,The Gift,634,What happens to her now?
S05E07,The Gift,635,"Well, she and her brother are both being held"
S05E07,The Gift,636,under fair suspicion.
S05E07,The Gift,637,A trial will be held for each of them
S05E07,The Gift,638,to determine if they're guilty of any acts
S05E07,The Gift,639,that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith.
S05E07,The Gift,640,Who will stand judge?
S05E07,The Gift,641,Seven septons as it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
S05E07,The Gift,642,Will you be one of them?
S05E07,The Gift,643,I will.
S05E07,The Gift,644,If one or both of them
S05E07,The Gift,645,were to confess before the trial...
S05E07,The Gift,646,Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.
S05E07,The Gift,647,And what does the Mother's mercy entail?
S05E07,The Gift,648,It depends upon the situation.
S05E07,The Gift,649,"The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
S05E07,The Gift,650,"Thank you, High Septon,"
S05E07,The Gift,651,for bringing them whatever justice they deserve
S05E07,The Gift,652,<i>in the eyes of the Seven.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,653,<i>Did you know this chapel</i>
S05E07,The Gift,654,is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
S05E07,The Gift,655,I think I may have heard at one point.
S05E07,The Gift,656,Baelor built his sept around it.
S05E07,The Gift,657,But men worshipped here long before him.
S05E07,The Gift,658,Who carved this altar?
S05E07,The Gift,659,- Do you know? - I'm afraid I don't.
S05E07,The Gift,660,No one does.
S05E07,The Gift,661,There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel.
S05E07,The Gift,662,"No, the people who built this place"
S05E07,The Gift,663,didn't inflict their vanity on those who came after them
S05E07,The Gift,664,the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there.
S05E07,The Gift,665,Hmm.
S05E07,The Gift,666,Their faith was clean.
S05E07,The Gift,667,"Strip away the gold and the ornaments,"
S05E07,The Gift,668,"knock down the statues and the pillars,"
S05E07,The Gift,669,and this is what remains.
S05E07,The Gift,670,Something simple...
S05E07,The Gift,671,and solid and true.
S05E07,The Gift,672,The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.
S05E07,The Gift,673,<i>Their lies knocked down.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,674,<i>Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,675,And so it will be for all of us.
S05E07,The Gift,676,High and low alike.
S05E07,The Gift,677,What will we find
S05E07,The Gift,678,when we strip away your finery?
S05E07,The Gift,679,A young man came to us not long ago.
S05E07,The Gift,680,Broken in body and spirit.
S05E07,The Gift,681,He had so much to strip away.
S05E07,The Gift,682,<i>So much weighing him down.</i>
S05E07,The Gift,683,"<i>But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,684,"<i>Let go of vanity,</i>"
S05E07,The Gift,685,"pride, sin."
S05E07,The Gift,686,"Now his soul is so light,"
S05E07,The Gift,687,he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird.
S05E07,The Gift,688,Hmm.
S05E07,The Gift,689,And he has much to say about you.
S05E07,The Gift,690,Move.
S05E07,The Gift,691,Let me go immediately.
S05E07,The Gift,692,You will order her to let me go.
S05E07,The Gift,693,I am the queen! I am the queen!
S05E07,The Gift,694,Have you lost your mind?
S05E07,The Gift,695,Let me go!
S05E07,The Gift,696,<i>Get your filthy hands off me!</i>
S05E07,The Gift,697,<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>
S05E07,The Gift,698,<i>I am the queen! Let me go!</i>
S05E07,The Gift,699,Look at me.
S05E07,The Gift,700,Look at my face.
S05E07,The Gift,701,It's the last thing you'll see before you die.

S05E08,Hardhome,6,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
S05E08,Hardhome,7,You will not speak.
S05E08,Hardhome,8,How do I know you are who you say you are?
S05E08,Hardhome,9,If only I were otherwise.
S05E08,Hardhome,10,"If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you"
S05E08,Hardhome,11,to pay your family back for what it did to mine?
S05E08,Hardhome,12,You want revenge against the Lannisters?
S05E08,Hardhome,13,I killed my mother Joanna Lannister
S05E08,Hardhome,14,on the day I was born.
S05E08,Hardhome,15,I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart.
S05E08,Hardhome,16,I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
S05E08,Hardhome,17,So I should welcome you into my service
S05E08,Hardhome,18,because you murdered members of your own family?
S05E08,Hardhome,19,Into your service?
S05E08,Hardhome,20,"Your Grace, we have only just met."
S05E08,Hardhome,21,It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
S05E08,Hardhome,22,"If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,"
S05E08,Hardhome,23,just say the word.
S05E08,Hardhome,24,"When I was a young man, I heard a story"
S05E08,Hardhome,25,about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory.
S05E08,Hardhome,26,"She had no wealth, no lands, no army,"
S05E08,Hardhome,27,"<i>only a name</i> <i>and a handful of supporters,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,28,most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves.
S05E08,Hardhome,29,"They kept her alive, moving her from place to place,"
S05E08,Hardhome,30,<i>often hours ahead of the men</i> <i>who'd been sent to kill her.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,31,<i>She was eventually sold off to</i> <i>some warlord on the edge of the world</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,32,<i>and that appeared</i> <i>to be that.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,33,"<i>And then</i> <i>a few years later,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,34,the most well-informed person I knew
S05E08,Hardhome,35,"told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies"
S05E08,Hardhome,36,"had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time,"
S05E08,Hardhome,37,along with three dragons.
S05E08,Hardhome,38,"<i>He thought</i> <i>she was our best,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,39,<i>last chance to build</i> <i>a better world.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,40,I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.
S05E08,Hardhome,41,And why are you worth meeting?
S05E08,Hardhome,42,Why should I spend my time listening to you?
S05E08,Hardhome,43,Because you cannot build a better world on your own.
S05E08,Hardhome,44,You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule.
S05E08,Hardhome,45,The strengths and weaknesses of the houses
S05E08,Hardhome,46,<i>that will either</i> <i>join or oppose you.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,47,I will have a very large army
S05E08,Hardhome,48,and very large dragons.
S05E08,Hardhome,49,Killing and politics aren't always the same thing.
S05E08,Hardhome,50,"When I served as Hand of the King,"
S05E08,Hardhome,51,I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question
S05E08,Hardhome,52,preferred torturing animals to leading his people.
S05E08,Hardhome,53,I could do an even better job
S05E08,Hardhome,54,advising a ruler worth the name.
S05E08,Hardhome,55,<i>If that is indeed</i> <i>what you are.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,56,So you want to advise me?
S05E08,Hardhome,57,Very well.
S05E08,Hardhome,58,What would you have me do with him?
S05E08,Hardhome,59,<i>I swore I would kill him</i> <i>if he ever returned.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,60,I know.
S05E08,Hardhome,61,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
S05E08,Hardhome,62,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you,"
S05E08,Hardhome,63,he is no longer that man.
S05E08,Hardhome,64,I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
S05E08,Hardhome,65,as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.
S05E08,Hardhome,66,<i>He claims he would kill</i> <i>for you and die for you</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,67,<i>and nothing I ever witnessed</i> <i>gives me reason to doubt him.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,68,And yet he did betray you.
S05E08,Hardhome,69,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?
S05E08,Hardhome,70,Yes.
S05E08,Hardhome,71,Many opportunities.
S05E08,Hardhome,72,<i>And did he?</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,73,"No, not until forced to do so."
S05E08,Hardhome,74,He worships you.
S05E08,Hardhome,75,"He is in love with you, I think."
S05E08,Hardhome,76,<i>But he did not trust you</i> <i>with the truth.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,77,"<i>An unpleasant truth</i> <i>to be sure,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,78,<i>but one of great</i> <i>significance to you.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,79,<i>He did not trust that you would</i> <i>be wise >enough to forgive him.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,80,So I should kill him?
S05E08,Hardhome,81,A ruler who kills those devoted to her
S05E08,Hardhome,82,is not a ruler who inspires devotion.
S05E08,Hardhome,83,"And you're going to need to inspire devotion,"
S05E08,Hardhome,84,"a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea."
S05E08,Hardhome,85,But you cannot have him by your side when you do.
S05E08,Hardhome,86,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
S05E08,Hardhome,87,Confess.
S05E08,Hardhome,88,My son.
S05E08,Hardhome,89,Let me speak to--
S05E08,Hardhome,90,Confess.
S05E08,Hardhome,91,I meant it.
S05E08,Hardhome,92,My face will be the last thing you see--
S05E08,Hardhome,93,My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.
S05E08,Hardhome,94,"<i>When I was eight,</i> <i>I begged enough money</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,95,<i>to buy my first</i> <i>bucket of oysters.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,96,I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more.
S05E08,Hardhome,97,"<i>It took a while,</i> <i>but I finally saved enough</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,98,<i>to buy myself</i> <i>an oyster cart.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,99,"<i>Now every morning,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,100,<i>I make my way</i> <i>down to the canals.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,101,<i>I pass the fish mongers</i> <i>and the bakers.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,102,"<i>I usually see Lhara,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,103,<i>my first customer of the day</i> <i>on her way home.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,104,<i>Then I turn left</i> <i>onto Moonsinger Lane--</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,105,Turn left onto Ragman Lane
S05E08,Hardhome,106,where I do most of my trade.
S05E08,Hardhome,107,Lanna is very impressive.
S05E08,Hardhome,108,Very industrious.
S05E08,Hardhome,109,She will make a fine servant for the Many-Faced God.
S05E08,Hardhome,110,How will she serve him?
S05E08,Hardhome,111,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane.
S05E08,Hardhome,112,She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
S05E08,Hardhome,113,What will she do there?
S05E08,Hardhome,114,She will see.
S05E08,Hardhome,115,<i>See what?</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,116,<i>How can a man</i> <i>tell a girl this?</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,117,"<i>If he knew</i> <i>what she would see,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,118,<i>there would be</i> <i>no reason to send her.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,119,"Oysters, clams, and cockles!"
S05E08,Hardhome,120,"Oysters, clams, and cockles!"
S05E08,Hardhome,121,"Oysters, clams, and cockles!"
S05E08,Hardhome,122,Your oysters fresh?
S05E08,Hardhome,123,Best in the city.
S05E08,Hardhome,124,"You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?"
S05E08,Hardhome,125,Mm.
S05E08,Hardhome,126,Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.
S05E08,Hardhome,127,It's my 18th voyage.
S05E08,Hardhome,128,Returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
S05E08,Hardhome,129,Can't do it.
S05E08,Hardhome,130,"<i>Please,</i> <i>I've three children.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,131,<i>Without me...</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,132,"Here, take it. You have to."
S05E08,Hardhome,133,I've three children.
S05E08,Hardhome,134,- What will they do? - Come on.
S05E08,Hardhome,135,They've nothing without me.
S05E08,Hardhome,136,"<i>Please, you have to!</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,137,"Please, you don't understand!"
S05E08,Hardhome,138,<i>Please!</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,139,<i>The man is a gambler.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,140,He wages that a sailor's ship
S05E08,Hardhome,141,will make it to its destination.
S05E08,Hardhome,142,It is a strange wager for the captain.
S05E08,Hardhome,143,He only wins if he loses his life.
S05E08,Hardhome,144,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
S05E08,Hardhome,145,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
S05E08,Hardhome,146,"If the captain dies,"
S05E08,Hardhome,147,the thin man pays his family a lot of money.
S05E08,Hardhome,148,But perhaps the gambler loses his bet
S05E08,Hardhome,149,and decides he does not have to pay after all.
S05E08,Hardhome,150,"A destitute woman and her small child,"
S05E08,Hardhome,151,what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself?
S05E08,Hardhome,152,To whom can they turn for recourse?
S05E08,Hardhome,153,The Many-Faced God.
S05E08,Hardhome,154,You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
S05E08,Hardhome,155,A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not.
S05E08,Hardhome,156,A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.
S05E08,Hardhome,157,She will watch the gambler.
S05E08,Hardhome,158,<i>She will come to know as much about</i> <i>him as she knows about herself.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,159,And then what?
S05E08,Hardhome,160,A gift for the thin man.
S05E08,Hardhome,161,She's not ready.
S05E08,Hardhome,162,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
S05E08,Hardhome,163,And if she's not?
S05E08,Hardhome,164,It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.
S05E08,Hardhome,165,The trial will take place soon.
S05E08,Hardhome,166,<i>The High Sparrow</i> <i>will be presenting</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,167,<i>a substantial case</i> <i>against you.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,168,The charges?
S05E08,Hardhome,169,"<i>Fornication,</i> <i>treason, incest,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,170,the murder of King Robert.
S05E08,Hardhome,171,All lies.
S05E08,Hardhome,172,"Of course, Your Grace."
S05E08,Hardhome,173,My concern is that the Faith does not adhere
S05E08,Hardhome,174,to the same standards of proof as the crown.
S05E08,Hardhome,175,"<i>I hope you'll excuse me</i> <i>for saying it,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,176,<i>but belief is so often</i> <i>the death of reason.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,177,I wish you had said it sooner.
S05E08,Hardhome,178,Is there any word from Jaime?
S05E08,Hardhome,179,"No, I'm afraid not."
S05E08,Hardhome,180,"Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle"
S05E08,Hardhome,181,has summoned your Uncle Kevan
S05E08,Hardhome,182,back from Casterly Rock
S05E08,Hardhome,183,to serve as Hand of the King.
S05E08,Hardhome,184,He now presides over the small council.
S05E08,Hardhome,185,Tell him I need to speak to him.
S05E08,Hardhome,186,"I implored him to visit you, but he would not."
S05E08,Hardhome,187,"What about my son, the king?"
S05E08,Hardhome,188,"If you can visit me, then surely the king..."
S05E08,Hardhome,189,"Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest,"
S05E08,Hardhome,190,the king has not taken them well.
S05E08,Hardhome,191,<i>He remains</i> <i>in his chambers.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,192,His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched.
S05E08,Hardhome,193,You need to talk to him.
S05E08,Hardhome,194,"You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me,"
S05E08,Hardhome,195,come and see his mother.
S05E08,Hardhome,196,"He-- I tried, Your Grace."
S05E08,Hardhome,197,He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone.
S05E08,Hardhome,198,I can't stay here.
S05E08,Hardhome,199,"There is a way, Your Grace."
S05E08,Hardhome,200,A way out.
S05E08,Hardhome,201,Confess?
S05E08,Hardhome,202,To the High Sparrow?
S05E08,Hardhome,203,I won't.
S05E08,Hardhome,204,I made him.
S05E08,Hardhome,205,I rose him up from nothing.
S05E08,Hardhome,206,I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner
S05E08,Hardhome,207,and beg his forgiveness.
S05E08,Hardhome,208,"Good-bye, my queen."
S05E08,Hardhome,209,The work continues.
S05E08,Hardhome,210,Why?
S05E08,Hardhome,211,"Why, Theon?"
S05E08,Hardhome,212,I'm not Theon. There is no Theon.
S05E08,Hardhome,213,- Reek. - Reek.
S05E08,Hardhome,214,"Why did you tell him, Reek?"
S05E08,Hardhome,215,I was helping you.
S05E08,Hardhome,216,You wanted to escape.
S05E08,Hardhome,217,There is no escape.
S05E08,Hardhome,218,Not ever.
S05E08,Hardhome,219,Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.
S05E08,Hardhome,220,The master knew.
S05E08,Hardhome,221,He knows everything.
S05E08,Hardhome,222,He hunted him and caught him
S05E08,Hardhome,223,and strapped him to a cross
S05E08,Hardhome,224,and cut away piece after piece
S05E08,Hardhome,225,until there was no Theon left.
S05E08,Hardhome,226,Good.
S05E08,Hardhome,227,"If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family."
S05E08,Hardhome,228,If I could do what Ramsay did to you
S05E08,Hardhome,229,"right here, right now, I would."
S05E08,Hardhome,230,I deserved everything.
S05E08,Hardhome,231,I deserve to be Reek.
S05E08,Hardhome,232,! <i>I did terrible things.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,233,Turned on Robb.
S05E08,Hardhome,234,Captured Winterfell.
S05E08,Hardhome,235,"- Killed those boys. - They weren't ""those boys."""
S05E08,Hardhome,236,They were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers.
S05E08,Hardhome,237,You've known them since they were born.
S05E08,Hardhome,238,They weren't. They were only--
S05E08,Hardhome,239,Only what?
S05E08,Hardhome,240,- I can't. - Tell me.
S05E08,Hardhome,241,"I can't, not unless the master says."
S05E08,Hardhome,242,- Tell me. They weren't what? - They weren't--
S05E08,Hardhome,243,Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
S05E08,Hardhome,244,while you still breathe the air.
S05E08,Hardhome,245,"Tell me to my face, Theon."
S05E08,Hardhome,246,Tell me that they weren't your brothers!
S05E08,Hardhome,247,They weren't Bran and Rickon!
S05E08,Hardhome,248,I couldn't find them.
S05E08,Hardhome,249,It was two farm boys.
S05E08,Hardhome,250,I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
S05E08,Hardhome,251,You didn't?
S05E08,Hardhome,252,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
S05E08,Hardhome,253,I can't talk to you anymore.
S05E08,Hardhome,254,"Theon, you have to tell me. Do you have any idea where--"
S05E08,Hardhome,255,Not Theon! Reek!
S05E08,Hardhome,256,"Our scouts tell us he's got no more than 6,000 men."
S05E08,Hardhome,257,"More than half of those are mounted, however."
S05E08,Hardhome,258,And how high do Stannis's horses jump?
S05E08,Hardhome,259,Our walls have been fully repaired.
S05E08,Hardhome,260,The gates have been reinforced.
S05E08,Hardhome,261,We have enough food for six months.
S05E08,Hardhome,262,We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be.
S05E08,Hardhome,263,"All we have to do is wait for them to freeze,"
S05E08,Hardhome,264,"starve, and mutiny."
S05E08,Hardhome,265,You disagree?
S05E08,Hardhome,266,Stannis isn't from the North.
S05E08,Hardhome,267,"You are, Father."
S05E08,Hardhome,268,I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North
S05E08,Hardhome,269,<i>how House Bolton</i> <i>treats southern invaders.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,270,And what do you recommend?
S05E08,Hardhome,271,<i>That we not sit</i> <i>and wait for Stannis</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,272,<i>to decide what sort of fight</i> <i>this is going to be.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,273,That we hit first and hit hard
S05E08,Hardhome,274,and leave a feast for the crows.
S05E08,Hardhome,275,A smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage.
S05E08,Hardhome,276,"<i>As long as we stay</i> <i>behind these walls,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,277,<i>they can't touch us.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,278,"Not to mention that the snow is so deep,"
S05E08,Hardhome,279,we couldn't get an army through to engage them
S05E08,Hardhome,280,even if we wanted to.
S05E08,Hardhome,281,I don't need an army.
S05E08,Hardhome,282,I need 20 good men.
S05E08,Hardhome,283,"So, have you decided yet?"
S05E08,Hardhome,284,Whether I'm worthy of your service?
S05E08,Hardhome,285,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
S05E08,Hardhome,286,It's probably my safest option.
S05E08,Hardhome,287,I can see why you would think so.
S05E08,Hardhome,288,It's what your father would have done.
S05E08,Hardhome,289,And what would your father have done?
S05E08,Hardhome,290,"My father,"
S05E08,Hardhome,291,who publically sentenced me to death?
S05E08,Hardhome,292,I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
S05E08,Hardhome,293,Is that why you killed him?
S05E08,Hardhome,294,"Someday if you decide not to execute me,"
S05E08,Hardhome,295,I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.
S05E08,Hardhome,296,"And on that day, should it ever come,"
S05E08,Hardhome,297,we'll need more wine than this.
S05E08,Hardhome,298,I know what my father was.
S05E08,Hardhome,299,<i>What he did.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,300,I know the Mad King earned his name.
S05E08,Hardhome,301,"So, here we sit."
S05E08,Hardhome,302,Two terrible children of two terrible fathers.
S05E08,Hardhome,303,I'm terrible?
S05E08,Hardhome,304,I've heard stories.
S05E08,Hardhome,305,Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible?
S05E08,Hardhome,306,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
S05E08,Hardhome,307,Which kind is that?
S05E08,Hardhome,308,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
S05E08,Hardhome,309,"Well, I did reopen the fighting pits."
S05E08,Hardhome,310,"Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment."
S05E08,Hardhome,311,"Yes, that was wise."
S05E08,Hardhome,312,And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good.
S05E08,Hardhome,313,Very impressive.
S05E08,Hardhome,314,"<i>My own sister married someone</i> <i>she loathed as well,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,315,though not by choice and certainly not
S05E08,Hardhome,316,"for the greater good, gods forbid."
S05E08,Hardhome,317,She ended up having him killed.
S05E08,Hardhome,318,Perhaps it won't come to that.
S05E08,Hardhome,319,It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
S05E08,Hardhome,320,Varys? King Robert's spymaster?
S05E08,Hardhome,321,"Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you."
S05E08,Hardhome,322,He was my travelling companion
S05E08,Hardhome,323,before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
S05E08,Hardhome,324,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.
S05E08,Hardhome,325,For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
S05E08,Hardhome,326,He did what he had to do to survive.
S05E08,Hardhome,327,"He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do."
S05E08,Hardhome,328,<i>I suspect he's the main reason</i> <i>you weren't slaughtered in your crib.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,329,But you trust him?
S05E08,Hardhome,330,"<i>Yes, oddly.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,331,He may be the only person in the world I trust.
S05E08,Hardhome,332,Except my brother.
S05E08,Hardhome,333,The brother who killed my father?
S05E08,Hardhome,334,That's the one.
S05E08,Hardhome,335,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
S05E08,Hardhome,336,Your queenly prerogative.
S05E08,Hardhome,337,I had given up on life
S05E08,Hardhome,338,until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for.
S05E08,Hardhome,339,"If you chop off my head, well,"
S05E08,Hardhome,340,my final days were interesting.
S05E08,Hardhome,341,I'm not going to kill you.
S05E08,Hardhome,342,No? Banish me?
S05E08,Hardhome,343,No.
S05E08,Hardhome,344,So if I'm not going to be murdered
S05E08,Hardhome,345,and I'm not going to be banished--
S05E08,Hardhome,346,You're going to advise me.
S05E08,Hardhome,347,While you can still speak in complete sentences.
S05E08,Hardhome,348,Advise you on what?
S05E08,Hardhome,349,How to get what I want.
S05E08,Hardhome,350,The Iron Throne.
S05E08,Hardhome,351,Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
S05E08,Hardhome,352,"If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool."
S05E08,Hardhome,353,<i>I'm not entirely joking.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,354,<i>There's more to the world</i> <i>than Westeros after all.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,355,How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here?
S05E08,Hardhome,356,"Perhaps this is where you belong,"
S05E08,Hardhome,357,where you can do the most good.
S05E08,Hardhome,358,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay
S05E08,Hardhome,359,would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold.
S05E08,Hardhome,360,<i>I will continue</i> <i>that fight here and beyond.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,361,But this is not my home.
S05E08,Hardhome,362,"When you get back to your home, who supports you?"
S05E08,Hardhome,363,The common people.
S05E08,Hardhome,364,Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen.
S05E08,Hardhome,365,"Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people"
S05E08,Hardhome,366,and only the common people.
S05E08,Hardhome,367,What was that like? Ruling without the rich?
S05E08,Hardhome,368,House Targaryen is gone.
S05E08,Hardhome,369,Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you.
S05E08,Hardhome,370,<i>The Starks</i> <i>are gone as well.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,371,<i>Our two terrible fathers</i> <i>saw to that.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,372,<i>The remaining members</i> <i>of House Lannister</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,373,"<i>will never back you,</i> <i>not ever.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,374,"Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either."
S05E08,Hardhome,375,His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours.
S05E08,Hardhome,376,<i>That leaves the Tyrells.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,377,"Not impossible, not enough."
S05E08,Hardhome,378,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell."
S05E08,Hardhome,379,They're all just spokes on a wheel.
S05E08,Hardhome,380,"This one's on top, then that one's on top."
S05E08,Hardhome,381,"And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground."
S05E08,Hardhome,382,"It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel."
S05E08,Hardhome,383,You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.
S05E08,Hardhome,384,I'm not going to stop the wheel.
S05E08,Hardhome,385,I'm going to break the wheel.
S05E08,Hardhome,386,You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.
S05E08,Hardhome,387,I won.
S05E08,Hardhome,388,You struck me.
S05E08,Hardhome,389,Have me flogged if it makes you happy.
S05E08,Hardhome,390,But I'm the best you've got.
S05E08,Hardhome,391,"If I win at the Great Pit,"
S05E08,Hardhome,392,how much can you sell me for?
S05E08,Hardhome,393,You're a free man.
S05E08,Hardhome,394,You could have gone anywhere.
S05E08,Hardhome,395,Why did you come back?
S05E08,Hardhome,396,Let me fight for her
S05E08,Hardhome,397,and I belong to you.
S05E08,Hardhome,398,<i>Thirsty?</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,399,Confess.
S05E08,Hardhome,400,"I'll get out of here, you realize, before long."
S05E08,Hardhome,401,Confess.
S05E08,Hardhome,402,I can make you a wealthy woman.
S05E08,Hardhome,403,A lady of the court.
S05E08,Hardhome,404,Confess.
S05E08,Hardhome,405,Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable.
S05E08,Hardhome,406,And all I do is sit here
S05E08,Hardhome,407,imagining hideous ways for you to die.
S05E08,Hardhome,408,Does it hurt?
S05E08,Hardhome,409,No.
S05E08,Hardhome,410,Good.
S05E08,Hardhome,411,How are you?
S05E08,Hardhome,412,I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
S05E08,Hardhome,413,You know what I mean.
S05E08,Hardhome,414,I'm good.
S05E08,Hardhome,415,- Are you scared? - A little.
S05E08,Hardhome,416,"Me, too."
S05E08,Hardhome,417,- Who's there? - <i>Olly.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,418,Oh.
S05E08,Hardhome,419,Come in.
S05E08,Hardhome,420,I heard what happened.
S05E08,Hardhome,421,"Oh, not to worry."
S05E08,Hardhome,422,Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
S05E08,Hardhome,423,Figured you were hungry.
S05E08,Hardhome,424,"Oh, you're a good lad."
S05E08,Hardhome,425,Wanted to ask you something
S05E08,Hardhome,426,if you've got the time.
S05E08,Hardhome,427,I need to check on baby Sam.
S05E08,Hardhome,428,"<i>Now then,</i> <i>how can I help?</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,429,- It's about the Lord Commander. - Yes?
S05E08,Hardhome,430,He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings.
S05E08,Hardhome,431,Wildlings killed my mom and dad.
S05E08,Hardhome,432,They killed everyone in my village.
S05E08,Hardhome,433,We've been fighting them for years.
S05E08,Hardhome,434,<i>This wasn't a fight.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,435,We were farmers and they slaughtered us.
S05E08,Hardhome,436,So why is he saving them?
S05E08,Hardhome,437,Wildlings are people.
S05E08,Hardhome,438,"Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones."
S05E08,Hardhome,439,"The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard,"
S05E08,Hardhome,440,he led the raid on my village.
S05E08,Hardhome,441,"- <i>Oh, Olly.</i> - How can he trust him?"
S05E08,Hardhome,442,I've seen the army of the dead.
S05E08,Hardhome,443,<i>I've seen</i> <i>the white walkers.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,444,"And they're coming for us, for all the living."
S05E08,Hardhome,445,"And when it's time,"
S05E08,Hardhome,446,we'll need every last man we can find.
S05E08,Hardhome,447,But what if we let the wildlings through the gates
S05E08,Hardhome,448,and they cut our throats while we sleep?
S05E08,Hardhome,449,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to."
S05E08,Hardhome,450,We don't stand a chance otherwise.
S05E08,Hardhome,451,"<i>Sometimes a man</i> <i>has to make hard choices,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,452,"<i>choices that might look</i> <i>wrong to others,</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,453,<i>but you know are right</i> <i>in the long run.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,454,You believe that?
S05E08,Hardhome,455,With all my heart.
S05E08,Hardhome,456,"<i>Try not to worry, Olly.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,457,I've been worrying about Jon for years.
S05E08,Hardhome,458,He always comes back.
S05E08,Hardhome,459,<i>Turn us about!</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,460,"You trust me, Jon Snow?"
S05E08,Hardhome,461,Does that make me a fool?
S05E08,Hardhome,462,We're fools together now.
S05E08,Hardhome,463,Lord of Bones.
S05E08,Hardhome,464,Been a long time.
S05E08,Hardhome,465,"Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner."
S05E08,Hardhome,466,The other way around now. What happened?
S05E08,Hardhome,467,War.
S05E08,Hardhome,468,War? You call that a war?
S05E08,Hardhome,469,The greatest army the North has ever seen
S05E08,Hardhome,470,cut to pieces by some southern king.
S05E08,Hardhome,471,"We should gather the elders,"
S05E08,Hardhome,472,find somewhere quiet to talk.
S05E08,Hardhome,473,You don't give the orders here.
S05E08,Hardhome,474,I'm not giving an order.
S05E08,Hardhome,475,Why aren't you in chains?
S05E08,Hardhome,476,He's not my prisoner.
S05E08,Hardhome,477,No?
S05E08,Hardhome,478,What is he?
S05E08,Hardhome,479,We're allies.
S05E08,Hardhome,480,You fucking traitor.
S05E08,Hardhome,481,You fight for the crows now?
S05E08,Hardhome,482,I don't fight for the crows.
S05E08,Hardhome,483,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
S05E08,Hardhome,484,Is that right?
S05E08,Hardhome,485,"You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?"
S05E08,Hardhome,486,"And when you're done talking,"
S05E08,Hardhome,487,do you get down on your knees and suck his cock?
S05E08,Hardhome,488,Gather the elders and let's talk.
S05E08,Hardhome,489,My name's Jon Snow.
S05E08,Hardhome,490,I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S05E08,Hardhome,491,We're not friends.
S05E08,Hardhome,492,<i>We've never been friends.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,493,<i>We won't become</i> <i>friends today.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,494,<i>This isn't</i> <i>about friendship.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,495,This is about survival.
S05E08,Hardhome,496,This is about putting a 700-foot wall
S05E08,Hardhome,497,between you and what's out there.
S05E08,Hardhome,498,You built that wall to keep us out.
S05E08,Hardhome,499,Since when do the crows give two shits if we live?
S05E08,Hardhome,500,<i>In normal times we wouldn't.</i> <i>But these aren't normal times.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,501,The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow.
S05E08,Hardhome,502,"We're all the same to them, meat for their army."
S05E08,Hardhome,503,But together we can beat them.
S05E08,Hardhome,504,Beat the white walkers?
S05E08,Hardhome,505,"Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
S05E08,Hardhome,506,It's not a trick.
S05E08,Hardhome,507,It's a gift for those who join us.
S05E08,Hardhome,508,Dragonglass.
S05E08,Hardhome,509,A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers
S05E08,Hardhome,510,<i>to kill a walker.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,511,- You saw this? - No.
S05E08,Hardhome,512,But I trust the man.
S05E08,Hardhome,513,There are old stories about dragonglass.
S05E08,Hardhome,514,There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.
S05E08,Hardhome,515,"And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them?"
S05E08,Hardhome,516,<i>Come with me and I'll share</i> <i>these weapons.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,517,Come with you where?
S05E08,Hardhome,518,<i>There are good lands</i> <i>south of the Wall.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,519,<i>The Night's Watch will let you</i> <i>through the tunnel</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,520,and allow your people to farm those lands.
S05E08,Hardhome,521,I knew Mance Rayder.
S05E08,Hardhome,522,<i>He never wanted a war</i> <i>with the Night's Watch.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,523,"<i>He wanted a new life</i> <i>for his people, for you.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,524,We're prepared to give you that new life.
S05E08,Hardhome,525,If?
S05E08,Hardhome,526,If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.
S05E08,Hardhome,527,Where is Mance?
S05E08,Hardhome,528,- He died. - How?
S05E08,Hardhome,529,I put an arrow through his heart.
S05E08,Hardhome,530,"Hey, hey."
S05E08,Hardhome,531,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
S05E08,Hardhome,532,"Hey, hey, hey."
S05E08,Hardhome,533,<i>I say we send</i> <i>the Lord Commander</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,534,back to Castle Black with no eyes.
S05E08,Hardhome,535,"Hey, none of you saw Mance die."
S05E08,Hardhome,536,I did.
S05E08,Hardhome,537,"The southern king who broke our army, Stannis,"
S05E08,Hardhome,538,wanted to burn him alive to send us a message.
S05E08,Hardhome,539,Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.
S05E08,Hardhome,540,His arrow was mercy.
S05E08,Hardhome,541,What he did took courage.
S05E08,Hardhome,542,"And that's what we need today,"
S05E08,Hardhome,543,the courage to make peace
S05E08,Hardhome,544,with men we've been killing for generations.
S05E08,Hardhome,545,"I lost my father, my uncle,"
S05E08,Hardhome,546,and two brothers fighting the damn crows.
S05E08,Hardhome,547,I'm not asking you to forget your dead.
S05E08,Hardhome,548,I'll never forget mine.
S05E08,Hardhome,549,I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall.
S05E08,Hardhome,550,But I'm asking you
S05E08,Hardhome,551,to think about your children now.
S05E08,Hardhome,552,<i>They'll never have</i> <i>children of their own</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,553,<i>if we don't band together.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,554,The Long Night is coming
S05E08,Hardhome,555,and the dead come with it.
S05E08,Hardhome,556,No clan can stop them.
S05E08,Hardhome,557,The free folk can't stop them.
S05E08,Hardhome,558,The Night's Watch can't stop them.
S05E08,Hardhome,559,And all the southern kings can't stop them.
S05E08,Hardhome,560,"<i>Only together,</i> <i>all of us.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,561,"And even then it may not be enough,"
S05E08,Hardhome,562,but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.
S05E08,Hardhome,563,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
S05E08,Hardhome,564,"He's prettier than both my daughters,"
S05E08,Hardhome,565,<i>but he knows</i> <i>how to fight.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,566,"He's young, but he knows how to lead."
S05E08,Hardhome,567,He didn't have to come to Hardhome.
S05E08,Hardhome,568,He came because he needs us
S05E08,Hardhome,569,and we need him.
S05E08,Hardhome,570,My ancestors would spit on me
S05E08,Hardhome,571,if I broke bread with a crow.
S05E08,Hardhome,572,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
S05E08,Hardhome,573,I'll never trust a man in black.
S05E08,Hardhome,574,"But I trust you, Tormund."
S05E08,Hardhome,575,"If you say this is the way,"
S05E08,Hardhome,576,we're with you.
S05E08,Hardhome,577,This is the way.
S05E08,Hardhome,578,<i>I'm with Tormund.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,579,"We stay here, we're dead men."
S05E08,Hardhome,580,"At least with King Crow, there's a chance."
S05E08,Hardhome,581,Tormund.
S05E08,Hardhome,582,Keep that new life you want to give us.
S05E08,Hardhome,583,"And keep your glass, King Crow."
S05E08,Hardhome,584,"As soon as you get on his ships, they're gonna slit your throats"
S05E08,Hardhome,585,and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.
S05E08,Hardhome,586,That's our enemy.
S05E08,Hardhome,587,That has always been our enemy.
S05E08,Hardhome,588,I fucking hate Thenns.
S05E08,Hardhome,589,- Move it. - Be careful.
S05E08,Hardhome,590,"<i>- Move 'em along, now.</i> <i>- Cast-off time.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,591,"<i>That's it, come on.</i>"
S05E08,Hardhome,592,"How many are with us? 5,000?"
S05E08,Hardhome,593,I'm not good at counting.
S05E08,Hardhome,594,We're leaving too many behind.
S05E08,Hardhome,595,The free folk are stubborn.
S05E08,Hardhome,596,You know how long it took Mance to band them together?
S05E08,Hardhome,597,20 fucking years.
S05E08,Hardhome,598,And he knew them better than I ever will.
S05E08,Hardhome,599,They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt.
S05E08,Hardhome,600,They'll come around.
S05E08,Hardhome,601,<i>- Get yourselves ready.</i> <i>- Aye!</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,602,Johnna is gonna look after you.
S05E08,Hardhome,603,She's in charge. You listen to her.
S05E08,Hardhome,604,<i>Take her.</i> <i>There you are.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,605,I want to go with you.
S05E08,Hardhome,606,I need to get the old folks on the boats.
S05E08,Hardhome,607,I'm right behind you. I promise.
S05E08,Hardhome,608,Go on.
S05E08,Hardhome,609,<i>Another one.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,610,<i>Keep moving.</i> <i>We'll meet you out there.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,611,<i>Won't be able to take that on the boat.</i> <i>It's too big.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,612,- <i>That's the last one!</i> - <i>Three more! Move on!</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,613,<i>There's more dragonglass everywhere.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,614,<i>I've got some more daggers</i> <i>over here.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,615,<i>Put that dagger</i> <i>in his bag.</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,616,Uh...
S05E08,Hardhome,617,<i>Steady!</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,618,Shut the gates.
S05E08,Hardhome,619,<i>Close the gates!</i>
S05E08,Hardhome,620,Shut the gates!
S05E08,Hardhome,621,Wait!

S05E08,Hardhome,632,Lord Commander!

S05E08,Hardhome,634,- But you'll never make-- - Now!
S05E08,Hardhome,635,- Let me on! - Let me on!
S05E08,Hardhome,636,- Bloody fucking move! - Let go!
S05E08,Hardhome,637,You should be on one of those boats.
S05E08,Hardhome,638,So should you. My little girls got on.
S05E08,Hardhome,639,They're gonna let them pass the Wall even if you're not there?
S05E08,Hardhome,640,You have my word. I've given orders.
S05E08,Hardhome,641,Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders.
S05E08,Hardhome,642,"If they get through, everyone dies."
S05E08,Hardhome,643,"Night's Watch, with me!"
S05E08,Hardhome,644,Move! Move!

S05E08,Hardhome,646,"No, no!"
S05E08,Hardhome,647,"<i>- Tormund, the sleigh!</i> - Okay, okay!"
S05E08,Hardhome,648,The dragonglass.
S05E08,Hardhome,649,"You and me, then!"
S05E08,Hardhome,650,Go!
S05E08,Hardhome,651,Get the glass.
S05E08,Hardhome,652,Come on!
S05E08,Hardhome,653,The dragonglass.
S05E08,Hardhome,654,Fuck the glass! We are gonna die here!
S05E08,Hardhome,655,"Oh, fuck!"

S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,3,"A band of 20 men, maybe less."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,4,They were in and out before anyone spotted them.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,5,"Burnt our food stores to the ground,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,6,all our siege weapons destroyed.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,7,- Dozens of tents were-- - Horses?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,8,"We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,9,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,10,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,11,Put last night's guards in chains.

S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,17,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,18,but if we can't march forward and we won't march back...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,19,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,24,It was a failure.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,25,It wasn't.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,26,I went to save them. I failed.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,27,You didn't fail him.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,28,Or him.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,29,<i>Or her.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,30,Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,31,I don't think that fact's lost on them.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,32,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,33,It'll get us all killed.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,34,Out of my way.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,35,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,36,Find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you.

S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,43,"Your Grace, you named me your Hand."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,44,Yes.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,45,"The King's Hand should never abandon the king,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,46,especially in time of war.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,47,You're not abandoning me. You're obeying a command.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,48,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,49,"And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,50,what does the boy say?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,51,I didn't name you Hand for your expertise in military matters.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,52,Ride for Castle Black. Don't come back empty-handed.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,53,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,54,and Princess Shireen could accompany me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,55,My family stays with me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,56,At least let me take Shireen.

S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,59,What's this one now?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,60,"""The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling"""
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,61,by Grand Maester Munkun.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,62,Now that sounds like a proper story.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,63,Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,64,He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,65,"And he crouched behind it and crept forward,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,66,hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,67,But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,68,And burnt him to a crisp.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,69,Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,70,of Ser Byron Swann.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,71,"I made you something, Princess."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,72,Do you like it?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,73,He's beautiful.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,74,- Thank you. - You're very welcome.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,75,"Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,76,Of course I will.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,77,But why am I getting a present?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,78,Because you deserve it.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,79,"My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,80,"Gods, I was stubborn about it."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,81,Made it this far without reading.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,82,Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,83,Wish I'd listened to him.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,84,This is my own poor way of saying thank you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,85,For teaching me to be a grown-up.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,86,"I'll be gone for a few days, Princess."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,87,"I want to hear all about ""The Dance of Dragons"" when I'm back."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,88,You'll read it yourself.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,89,Prince Doran.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,90,Forgive us. We started without you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,91,"<i>Please, sit.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,92,Princess Myrcella.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,93,Uncle.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,94,What a lovely dress.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,95,- You don't like it? - You must be cold.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,96,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,97,Prince Trystane.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,98,How's your jaw?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,99,A fleabite.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,100,What are you doing in Dorne?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,101,"Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,102,"And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,103,you decided to enter my country in secret
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,104,and abduct our guest by force?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,105,We received a threatening message.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,106,The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,107,That necklace was stolen from my room.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,108,"Oh, excellent."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,109,A last meal before the beheading?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,110,"Oh, I can't behead you."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,111,Many in Dorne want war.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,112,But I've seen war.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,113,I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,114,I've seen the orphans starving in the cities.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,115,I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,116,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,117,And that is precisely what we are doing.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,118,"Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,119,"<i>King of the Andals</i> <i>and the First Men,</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,120,Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,121,King Tommen insists
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,122,on his sister's return to the capital?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,123,I'm afraid he does.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,124,I cannot disobey my king's command.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,125,She will return with you to King's Landing.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,126,<i>And my son Prince Trystane</i> <i>will accompany you both.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,127,"If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,128,their engagement must stand.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,129,I accept.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,130,One more thing. My brother was named
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,131,to the small council before his death.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,132,Your father understood the importance
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,133,<i>of keeping Dorne in the fold.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,134,"With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,135,You have my word.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,136,The word of a kingslayer.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,137,No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,138,"You are mother to four of my nieces,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,139,girls I love very much.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,140,"For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,141,"Speak to me that way again, and you won't."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,142,May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,143,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,144,how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,145,He said it was just a fleabite.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,146,The fault is mine.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,147,Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,148,"If anyone should be punished, it's me."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,149,Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,150,I'll let him decide.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,151,I have learned the value of mercy from my father.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,152,- <i> I'll set your man free.</i> - You're a good man.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,153,On one condition.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,154,Why do we play? I'm better than you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,155,I'll always be better than you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,156,Have I ever missed once?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,157,I don't think I have. I can't recall.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,158,You must love humiliation. Or pain.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,159,"Which do you love most, humiliation or pain?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,160,"That one hurt, didn't it?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,161,You going to cry?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,162,"Give up, little sister."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,163,"- You're going to miss. - Oh, I never miss."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,164,You will. You're thinking too much.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,165,Now you're nervous. What if she's right?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,166,- Luck. - Now it's my turn.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,167,You're too slow.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,168,You've always been too slow.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,169,Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,170,You'll find out very soon.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,171,"Say it one more time, handsome."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,172,Who am I?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,173,The most beautiful woman in the world.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,174,And that's the truth.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,175,Slut.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,176,"Prince Doran,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,177,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,178,I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,179,Only the one.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,180,I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,181,Prince.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,182,Sorry about the other day.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,183,<i>Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,184,He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,185,I'm glad to hear it.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,186,Pie looks good.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,187,There was one condition.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,188,Perhaps some soup instead.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,189,"Oysters, clams, and cockles."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,190,"Oysters, clams, and cockles."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,191,"Oysters, clams, and cockles."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,192,"Oysters, clams, and cock--"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,193,How much for your little clam?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,194,"Oysters, clams, and cockles."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,195,"Oysters, clams, and cockles."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,196,Come on.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,197,"<i>Some oysters, girl!</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,198,<i>I'm talking to you.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,199,"Is, uh..."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,200,- Girl! <i>-  Tie her up!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,201,<i>Are you deaf? Girl!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,202,Girl!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,203,My lord.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,204,<i>My lord.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,205,<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,206,"On behalf of the Iron Bank,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,207,may I be the first to welcome you
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,208,to the Free City of Braavos.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,209,I hope your journey was trouble-free.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,210,A bit of chop the last few days.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,211,Nothing too awful.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,212,Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,213,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,214,"Ah, the vintners say this might be"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,215,the best year for red grapes in half a century.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,216,"<i>If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,217,I'll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,218,I'm afraid I don't partake.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,219,Oh.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,220,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,221,"Pure nonsense, of course."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,222,I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,223,<i>Did you know that at one point Maegor the third</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,224,tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,225,Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,226,<i>and cut off both their hands.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,227,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,228,"<i>If a man charges no interest on a loan,</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,229,"<i>then he has nothing to gain</i> <i>and everything to lose,</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,230,<i>so why chance it?</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,231,<i>Whereas the promise of reward</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,232,<i>makes a man willing to gamble.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,233,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,234,You are the world's best gamblers.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,235,And all those bets you won built this.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,236,We should celebrate.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,237,I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,238,"<i>Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,239,"- I don't have that gift. - Oh, it's not a gift."

S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,248,Treasonous cunts.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,249,They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,250,"This is the place, lads."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,251,The sleekest little minks in Braavos.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,252,"- You buying? - Oh, I'm buying."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,253,But I never was good at sharing.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,254,Sell your fish somewhere else.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,255,"Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,256,"Come here, sweetness."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,257,They say oysters get the juices flowing.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,258,We'll take half a dozen.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,259,Three coppers.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,260,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,261,Too old.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,262,Brea.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,263,Too old.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,264,<i>I have just the one. Anara.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,265,<i>Our most expensive girl.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,266,"<i>But well worth it, I assure you.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,267,Too old.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,268,Do you have what I want or not?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,269,Of course. Of course.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,270,These fresh?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,271,"Come on, the lads are hungry."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,272,Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,273,<i>- Here. Thank you.</i> <i>- I'll have one.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,274,<i>Any vinegar?</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,275,Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,276,Good.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,277,I'll tell you when we're done.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,278,You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,279,Of course.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,280,"<i>I'll have you whipped, girl.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,281,"Go, go on. Out, out, go."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,282,Valar morghulis.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,283,Valar morghulis.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,284,And?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,285,The thin man wasn't hungry today.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,286,Perhaps that is why a man is thin.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,287,Tomorrow.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,288,Tomorrow.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,289,A girl has work to do.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,290,Your rebellion is over.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,291,You can swear your allegiance to me now...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,292,or you can die.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,293,I believe in second chances.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,294,I don't believe in third chances.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,295,You write like a seven-year-old.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,296,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,297,<i>He didn't try to make you pay?</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,298,Mm-mmm.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,299,Maybe he's changed.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,300,The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,301,She will.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,302,"You love her very much, don't you?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,303,"Of course, she's my niece."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,304,I wasn't talking about her.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,305,You think I disapprove?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,306,Why?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,307,Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,308,They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,309,Here no one blinked an eye.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,310,"100 years ago,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,311,no one would have blinked an eye at you
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,312,if you'd been named Targaryen.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,313,"It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,314,The only thing that stays the same
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,315,is that we want who we want.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,316,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,317,that happened to the man I love.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,318,Perhaps even you are innocent of that.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,319,Father.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,320,Aren't you cold?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,321,No. What are you reading?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,322,"- ""The Dance of Dragons."" - What's it about?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,323,It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,324,and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,325,Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,326,"When people started declaring for one of them or the other,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,327,their fight divided the kingdoms in two.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,328,"Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,329,"By the time it was over, thousands were dead."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,330,And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,331,They never truly recovered.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,332,"""The Dance of Dragons."""
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,333,Why is that a dance?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,334,It's just what they call it.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,335,"Hmm, doesn't make much sense."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,336,I think it's poetic.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,337,If you had to choose
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,338,between Rhaenyra and Aegon...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,339,who would you have chosen?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,340,I wouldn't have chosen either.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,341,It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,342,Sometimes a person has to choose.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,343,Sometimes the world forces his hand.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,344,If a man knows what he is...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,345,and remains true to himself...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,346,the choice is no choice at all.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,347,He must fulfill his destiny...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,348,and become who he is meant to be.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,349,However much he may hate it.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,350,"It's all right, Father."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,351,You don't even know what I'm talking about.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,352,It doesn't matter.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,353,I want to help you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,354,Is there any way I can help?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,355,"Yes, there is."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,356,Good. I want to.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,357,I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,358,And I'm your daughter.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,359,Forgive me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,360,Where's my father? I want to see my father.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,361,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,362,No.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,363,Where's my father?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,364,"No, you can't do this. Father, where are you?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,365,"<i>Please, let me see my father.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,366,"<i>Father, where are you?</i> <i>Don't let her do this.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,367,Please let go!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,368,<i>Let me see my father!</i> <i>Where are you? Please!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,369,- It's what the Lord wants. - No.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,370,- <i> Please! Let go! No!</i> - It's a good thing.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,371,- A great thing. <i>-  Stop. Stop!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,372,"<i>- Please!</i> <i>- Hear us now, my Lord.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,373,"<i>- You can't do this!</i> <i>- For you, we offer up this girl</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,374,- Please! -<i>...that you may cleanse her with your fire</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,375,and that its light may lead our way.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,376,"<i> Please! No, please let me see my father.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,377,"If we don't act, we'll all starve here."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,378,<i> All of us.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,379,But if we make this sacrifice...
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,380,"<i>Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,381,and lead us from the darkness.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,382,"- Lord of Light, show us the way. - Mother!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,383,"Mother, please!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,384,"Mother, please! Mother!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,385,- <i> Mother!</i> - We can't.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,386,- There's no other way. She has king's blood. -<i> Please don't do this!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,387,"<i>Lord of Light, protect us.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,388,"- Please! Father, please! -<i> For the night is dark and full of terrors.</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,389,Father!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,390,"Father, don't do this! Please!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,391,"Mother, no! Please! Please, help!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,392,Don't do this!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,393,"Please, Father! Mother, help!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,394,"- No. -<i> No, please! Don't do this!</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,395,"<i>Don't do this, please, Mother!</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,396,"<i>Please, Mother!</i> <i>Mother, help!</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,397,"Mother, help! Help!"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,398,"<i>Please don't do this, Mother!</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,399,<i>Please!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,400,"<i>Please, Mother!</i> <i>Please!</i>"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,401,<i>Please! No!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,402,<i>Please! No!</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,403,No!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,404,Where have you been?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,405,Just making sure everything is in order.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,406,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,407,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,408,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,409,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,410,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,411,They're waiting for you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,412,Clap your hands.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,413,"That one, the smaller man."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,414,"No question, that's where you should put your money."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,415,The smaller man it is.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,416,I'm not putting my money anywhere.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,417,Kings and queens never bet on the games.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,418,Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,419,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,420,He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,421,I've spent much of my life in this arena.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,422,"And in my experience, large men do triumph"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,423,over smaller men far more often than not.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,424,Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,425,You yourself?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,426,Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,427,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,428,"the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,429,then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,430,They couldn't get their money out fast enough.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,431,But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,432,or... here.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,433,And the big men were always too slow
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,434,to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,435,"Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,436,"making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,437,You don't approve?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,438,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,439,I can do without it in my leisure time.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,440,"Fair enough. Yet it's an unpleasant question,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,441,but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,442,"It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,443,especially when what is has worked out in your favor.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,444,I'm not talking about myself.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,445,I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,446,That is greatness?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,447,"That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen,"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,448,which existed long before you or I
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,449,and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,450,My father would have liked you.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,451,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,452,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,453,- At your command? - If need be.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,454,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,455,And how many people will die to make this happen?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,456,"If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason."
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,457,Those men think they're dying for a good reason.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,458,Someone else's reason.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,459,So your reasons are true and theirs are false?
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,460,"They don't know their own minds, but you do?"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,461,Well said. You're an eloquent man.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,462,Doesn't mean you're wrong.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,463,"In my experience, eloquent men are right"
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,464,every bit as often as imbeciles.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,465,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,466,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,467,_
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,468,- Your Grace-- - Shut your mouth.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,469,- You can end this. - She cannot.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,470,You can.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,471,Protect your queen!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,472,Go!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,473,Your Grace! Your Grace!
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,474,<i>Come with me.</i> <i>I know a way out.</i>
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,475,I know a way--
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,476,Stay close.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,477,This way.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,478,The other side.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,479,Follow me.
S05E09,The Dance Of Dragons,480,Protect your queen!

S05E10,Mother's Mercy,63,"I'll learn about history,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,64,"strategy, healing."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,65,"And other things,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,66,things that will help when--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,67,when they come.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,68,"If Gilly stays here, then she'll die."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,69,And the baby that she named after me will die.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,70,"And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,71,Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,72,will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,73,And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,74,Thank you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,75,"You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,76,"Oh, they'll bloody try."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,77,- Sam. - What?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,78,Sam.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,79,You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,80,"Oh, very carefully."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,81,I'm glad the end of the world's
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,82,working out well for someone.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,83,I'll come back.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,84,To your return.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,85,To my return.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,86,"<i>Aye, this way.</i>"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,87,<i>My lady!</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,88,Stannis.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,89,Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,90,How do you know it's Stannis?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,91,They're carrying his flaming heart banners.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,92,From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,93,Trench here.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,94,Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,95,Hurry them along.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,96,"- Right, Curlew. - Yes, sir."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,97,<i>Dig between those two rises.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,98,- Spread out. <i>-  I'm with you.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,99,<i>- Archers!</i> <i>- Spread out!</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,100,And send out a foraging party immediately.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,101,Siege begins at sunrise.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,102,"There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,103,<i>We've got no chance!</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,104,"<i>No, please, please.</i>"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,105,Bolton has women fighting for him?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,106,I don't fight for the Boltons.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,107,I'm Brienne of Tarth.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,108,I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,109,I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,110,<i>You murdered him</i> <i>with blood magic?</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,111,I did.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,112,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,113,"First of His Name,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,114,"rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,115,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,116,"I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,117,Do you have any last words?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,118,"Go on, do your duty."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,119,Looks like we're done here.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,120,I surrender! I surrender!
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,121,And I accept your surrender.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,122,Let's head back.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,123,My wife must be lonely.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,124,My lady.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,125,I've come to escort you back to your chamber.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,126,"Go with her, please."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,127,I know what Ramsay is.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,128,I know what he'll do to me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,129,"If I'm going to die,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,130,let it happen while there's still some of me left.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,131,Die?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,132,Who said anything about dying?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,133,You can't die.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,134,Your father was Warden of the North.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,135,Ramsay needs you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,136,Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,137,"Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,138,until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,139,Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,140,"So, shall we wait for him to come back"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,141,or should we begin now?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,142,You're leaving it to me?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,143,Good.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,144,Let's begin.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,145,Reek-- stop!
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,146,Stop!
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,147,- <i>-  Open the gate!</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,148,He's coming back.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,149,I can see I have my work cut out for me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,150,"You two, out."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,151,"You were the first person on my list, you know."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,152,For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,153,Probably not.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,154,I've gotten a few of the others.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,155,The Many-Faced God stole a few more from me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,156,But I'm glad he left me you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,157,Do you know who I am?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,158,I can't hear you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,159,You know who I am.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,160,I'm Arya Stark.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,161,Do you know who you are?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,162,You're no one.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,163,You're nothing.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,164,A girl has taken a life.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,165,The wrong life.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,166,I was right about her.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,167,You were.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,168,You're not ready.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,169,Not at all.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,170,That man's life was not yours to take.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,171,A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,172,Now a debt is owed.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,173,Only death can pay for life.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,174,No! No!
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,175,"No, you-- don't die! Don't die!"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,176,Why are you crying?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,177,He was my friend.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,178,"No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,179,<i>He was no one.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,180,But if you're--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,181,who's this?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,182,<i>No one at all.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,183,Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,184,<i>The faces are for no one.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,185,You are still someone.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,186,"And to someone,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,187,the faces are as good as poison.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,188,I can't see.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,189,What's happening?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,190,What's happening?!
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,191,<i>- I wish you a safe journey home.</i> - Thank you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,192,"Forgive me, child."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,193,I wish you all the happiness in the world.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,194,Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,195,Maybe I'll come visit you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,196,Don't wait too long.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,197,Got a noblewoman to marry back home.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,198,"You want a good girl,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,199,but you need the bad pussy.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,200,"<i>Whenever you're</i> <i>ready, my lord.</i>"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,201,Try not to lose it this time.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,202,I'll never take it off again.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,203,"I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,204,but I'm glad you're coming home.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,205,Your mother's desperate to see you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,206,I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,207,He seems like a nice boy.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,208,You're lucky.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,209,Arranged marriages are rarely so--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,210,so well arranged.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,211,Do you think Mother will like him?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,212,"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,213,You really believe that?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,214,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,215,aside from her children?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,216,She likes you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,217,I'm not so sure about that.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,218,Listen...
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,219,there's something I wanted to tell you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,220,Something I should have told you long ago.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,221,So...
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,222,"now that you've seen more of the world,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,223,"you've learned how complicated things can be,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,224,people can be.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,225,"The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,226,but you've fallen in love with Trystane.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,227,"It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,228,You happen to fall in love with the man
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,229,you were assigned to marry?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,230,My point is...
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,231,we don't choose whom we love.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,232,"It just, well--"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,233,it's beyond our control.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,234,"- I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,235,What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,236,and failing to say--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,237,I know what you're trying to say.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,238,"No, I'm afraid you don't."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,239,I do.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,240,I know.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,241,About you and Mother.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,242,I think a part of me always knew.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,243,And I'm glad.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,244,I'm glad that you're my father.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,245,Myrcella?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,246,Myrcella?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,247,Myrcella? Myrcella?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,248,"You love her, don't you?"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,249,How could you not?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,250,Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,251,"A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,252,Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,253,But we always want the wrong woman.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,254,Does he always talk so much?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,255,Jorah the Andal.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,256,Torgo Nudho.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,257,He should not be here.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,258,"No, but he is."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,259,Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,260,Our queen would be dead if not for him.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,261,<i>Puñila.</i> Thank you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,262,I am sorry.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,263,Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,264,You missed a good scrap.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,265,None of that matters now.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,266,"The longer we sit here bantering,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,267,the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,268,He's right. The dragon headed north.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,269,"If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,270,We?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,271,You're a Lannister.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,272,The queen intends to remove your family from power.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,273,And I intend to help her do it.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,274,You've been here for how many days now?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,275,I've fought for her for years.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,276,Since she was little more than a child.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,277,- You betrayed her. - Careful now.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,278,"And she exiled you. Twice, I believe."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,279,The second time thanks to you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,280,"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,281,He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,282,And he's right. Jorah saved her life.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,283,Perhaps she feels differently about him now.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,284,Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,285,"<i>Fine, fine.</i> <i>I suppose he can join us.</i>"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,286,Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,287,"If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,288,"Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,289,Pardon me?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,290,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,291,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,292,Can you fight?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,293,I have fought.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,294,I don't claim to be a great warrior.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,295,Are you good on a horse?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,296,Middling.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,297,So mainly you talk.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,298,And drink. I've survived so far.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,299,"Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,300,"You would help us here in Meereen, though."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,301,None of us have experience governing a city
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,302,except for him.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,303,You want to prove your value to the queen?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,304,Prove it right here in Meereen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,305,He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,306,Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,307,They wouldn't.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,308,They will listen to Grey Worm.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,309,I'll come with you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,310,I'll find our queen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,311,- You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,312,He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,313,But you still can't go.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,314,The people believe in you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,315,They know you speak for the queen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,316,It's true.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,317,Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,318,"If you leave, half this city will consume the other half."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,319,And Missandei.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,320,Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,321,Certainly not me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,322,"The queen's closest confidante,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,323,"the commander of the Unsullied,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,324,and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,325,"Good fortune, my friends."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,326,Meereen is ancient and glorious.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,327,Try not to ruin her.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,328,"Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,329,Let's find some good horses.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,330,We have so much to talk about.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,331,"Hello, old friend."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,332,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,333,I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,334,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,335,if one knows how to listen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,336,They tell me you've already found favor
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,337,with the Mother of Dragons.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,338,"Well, she didn't execute me,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,339,so that's a promising start.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,340,Now the heroes are off to find her
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,341,and I'm stuck here
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,342,trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,343,Any advice for an old comrade?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,344,Information is the key.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,345,You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,346,You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,347,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,348,If only.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,349,A grand old city
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,350,"choking on violence, corruption, and deceit."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,351,Who could possibly have any experience
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,352,"managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,353,I did miss you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,354,"Oh, I know."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,355,We have to go home.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,356,"Oh, my poor, sweet thing."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,357,Does it hurt?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,358,We have to go home.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,359,Drogon.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,360,Can you take me back to Meereen?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,361,How far did you carry me?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,362,"Drogon, we need to return."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,363,My people need me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,364,"Well, there's no food."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,365,"At the very least, you could hunt us some supper."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,366,Confess.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,367,Confess.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,368,I have sinned.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,369,I see that now.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,370,How can I have been so blind for so long?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,371,I want to be clean again.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,372,I want absolution.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,373,The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,374,And by its holy light--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,375,You wish to make a confession?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,376,"Once I've confessed, will I be free?"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,377,Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,378,"The Mother have mercy, then."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,379,I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,380,Name him.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,381,Lancel Lannister.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,382,Your cousin and the king's squire.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,383,- I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,384,A husband off whoring every chance he--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,385,His sins do not pardon your own.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,386,May the gods forgive me.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,387,Other men?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,388,No.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,389,No others?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,390,No.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,391,<i>Speaking falsehoods</i> <i>before the gods is a great crime.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,392,<i>You understand this?</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,393,I do.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,394,There are those that say your children
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,395,"were not fathered by King Robert,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,396,that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,397,A lie.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,398,A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,399,"He wants the throne, but his brother's 4 children stand in his way."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,400,So he claims they are not his brother's.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,401,That filth.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,402,There is not one shred of truth to it.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,403,I deny it.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,404,Good.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,405,But these are terrible charges.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,406,And the realm must know the truth of them.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,407,"If Your Grace has given honest testimony,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,408,your trial will prove your innocence.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,409,Trial? I have confessed.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,410,To a single sin.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,411,Others you have denied.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,412,Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,413,I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,414,But if I might beg
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,415,for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,416,I haven't seen my son--
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,417,I don't know how long it's been.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,418,"I need to see him, please."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,419,You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,420,"In light of this,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,421,I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,422,Thank you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,423,Thank you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,424,The Mother is merciful.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,425,It is her you should thank.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,426,I will. I will.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,427,"I swear it, day and night."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,428,Good.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,429,Am I free to go?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,430,After your atonement.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,431,My atonement?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,432,A sinner comes before you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,433,Cersei of House Lannister.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,434,Mother to His Grace King Tommen.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,435,Widow of His Grace King Robert.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,436,She has committed the acts of falsehood
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,437,and fornication.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,438,<i>She has confessed</i> <i>her sins</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,439,<i>and begged</i> <i>for forgiveness.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,440,"<i>To demonstrate</i> <i>her repentance,</i>"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,441,"<i>she will cast aside</i> <i>all pride, all artifice,</i>"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,442,<i>and present herself</i> <i>as the gods made her</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,443,"to you,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,444,the good people of the city.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,445,"She comes before you with a solemn heart,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,446,"shorn of secrets,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,447,<i>naked before the eyes</i> <i>of gods and men...</i>

S05E10,Mother's Mercy,530,Come.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,531,We'll take you inside.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,532,I need to have a look at those feet.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,533,May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,534,"If it please Your Grace, he has taken a holy vow of silence."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,535,He has sworn that he will not speak
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,536,until all His Grace's enemies are dead
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,537,and evil has been driven from the realm.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,538,Who came to your aid? Stannis.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,539,Now he needs you.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,540,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,541,The wildlings will make a difference.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,542,The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,543,- I told him before. - You saved their bloody lives.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,544,"If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,"
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,545,"safe behind<i> our</i> Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,546,- It's not their fight. <i>-  Open the gates!</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,547,Stannis?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,548,Shireen? The princess?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,549,Lord Commander.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,550,<i>It's one of the wildlings</i> <i>you brought back.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,551,<i>Says he knows</i> <i>your Uncle Benjen.</i>
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,552,Says he's still alive.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,553,Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,554,Said he was First Ranger.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,555,Said he knows where to find him.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,556,Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,557,at the last full moon.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,558,- Could be lying. - Could be.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,559,There are ways to find out.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,560,- Where is he? - Over there.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,561,For the Watch.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,562,For the Watch.
S05E10,Mother's Mercy,563,For the Watch.

S06E01,The Red Woman,6,Help me get him inside.
S06E01,The Red Woman,7,Thorne did this.
S06E01,The Red Woman,8,How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
S06E01,The Red Woman,9,Trust?
S06E01,The Red Woman,10,The men in this room.
S06E01,The Red Woman,11,Does the wolf know you?

S06E01,The Red Woman,18,<i>He was our Lord Commander.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,19,<i>He never should have been!</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,20,You all know why you're here.
S06E01,The Red Woman,21,Jon Snow is dead.
S06E01,The Red Woman,22,Who killed him?
S06E01,The Red Woman,23,I did.
S06E01,The Red Woman,24,And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck
S06E01,The Red Woman,25,and the other officers in this castle.
S06E01,The Red Woman,26,- Murderers! - Traitors!
S06E01,The Red Woman,27,You're right!
S06E01,The Red Woman,28,"<i>We've committed treason,</i> <i>all of us.</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,29,Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.
S06E01,The Red Woman,30,I had no love for him.
S06E01,The Red Woman,31,That was no secret.
S06E01,The Red Woman,32,But I never once disobeyed an order.
S06E01,The Red Woman,33,Loyalty is the foundation
S06E01,The Red Woman,34,on which the Night's Watch is built.
S06E01,The Red Woman,35,And the Watch means everything to me.
S06E01,The Red Woman,36,"I have given my life,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,37,we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch.
S06E01,The Red Woman,38,Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.
S06E01,The Red Woman,39,<i>He let the wildlings</i> <i>through our gates</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,40,as no Lord Commander has ever done before.
S06E01,The Red Woman,41,He gave them the very land on which they reaved
S06E01,The Red Woman,42,and raped and murdered.
S06E01,The Red Woman,43,"Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,44,I've no doubt about that.
S06E01,The Red Woman,45,And what he thought was right would have been the end of us.
S06E01,The Red Woman,46,He thrust a terrible choice upon us.
S06E01,The Red Woman,47,And we made it.
S06E01,The Red Woman,48,<i>He'll have seen</i> <i>we didn't come.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,49,Thorne will have made it official by now.
S06E01,The Red Woman,50,Castle Black is his.
S06E01,The Red Woman,51,I don't care who's sitting at the high table.
S06E01,The Red Woman,52,Jon was my friend.
S06E01,The Red Woman,53,And those fuckers butchered him.
S06E01,The Red Woman,54,Now we return the favor.
S06E01,The Red Woman,55,We don't have the numbers.
S06E01,The Red Woman,56,- We have a direwolf. - It's not enough.
S06E01,The Red Woman,57,"<i>I didn't know</i> <i>Lord Commander Snow for long,</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,58,but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.
S06E01,The Red Woman,59,"If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room."
S06E01,The Red Woman,60,We all die today.
S06E01,The Red Woman,61,I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.
S06E01,The Red Woman,62,"We need to fight, but we don't need to die."
S06E01,The Red Woman,63,- Not if we have help. - Who is gonna help us?
S06E01,The Red Woman,64,You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
S06E01,The Red Woman,65,Bolt the door.
S06E01,The Red Woman,66,Don't let anyone in.
S06E01,The Red Woman,67,I'll be back as soon as I can.
S06E01,The Red Woman,68,<i>She was 11 the first time</i> <i>I saw her.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,69,The kennelmaster's daughter.
S06E01,The Red Woman,70,She smelled of dog.
S06E01,The Red Woman,71,"I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me."
S06E01,The Red Woman,72,You certainly were.
S06E01,The Red Woman,73,"Myranda wasn't, though."
S06E01,The Red Woman,74,What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?
S06E01,The Red Woman,75,She was fearless.
S06E01,The Red Woman,76,There was nothing she wouldn't do.
S06E01,The Red Woman,77,Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.
S06E01,The Red Woman,78,I wish you could be here to watch.
S06E01,The Red Woman,79,"<i>Shall I have a grave</i> <i>dug for her, my lord?</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,80,<i>Or would you rather</i> <i>the men build a pyre?</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,81,"Buried, burned?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,82,This is good meat.
S06E01,The Red Woman,83,Feed it to the hounds.
S06E01,The Red Woman,84,Your command of the cavalry was impressive.
S06E01,The Red Woman,85,"Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead."
S06E01,The Red Woman,86,Do you know who struck the killing blow?
S06E01,The Red Woman,87,- No. - A shame.
S06E01,The Red Woman,88,I'd reward the man.
S06E01,The Red Woman,89,"Still, a great victory."
S06E01,The Red Woman,90,Do you feel like a victor?
S06E01,The Red Woman,91,I rebelled against the crown
S06E01,The Red Woman,92,to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.
S06E01,The Red Woman,93,Do you think that burning wagons in the night
S06E01,The Red Woman,94,"and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons"
S06E01,The Red Woman,95,is the same as facing a prepared Nd provisioned Lannister army?
S06E01,The Red Woman,96,No.
S06E01,The Red Woman,97,A reckoning will come.
S06E01,The Red Woman,98,We need the North to face it.
S06E01,The Red Woman,99,The entire North.
S06E01,The Red Woman,100,They won't back us without Sansa Stark.
S06E01,The Red Woman,101,We no longer have Sansa Stark.
S06E01,The Red Woman,102,You played your games with her.
S06E01,The Red Woman,103,You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands
S06E01,The Red Woman,104,and now they're both gone.
S06E01,The Red Woman,105,I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.
S06E01,The Red Woman,106,<i>They won't get far.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,107,I'm glad to hear it.
S06E01,The Red Woman,108,"Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir."
S06E01,The Red Woman,109,"And without an heir, well..."
S06E01,The Red Woman,110,let's hope the maesters are right
S06E01,The Red Woman,111,and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.
S06E01,The Red Woman,112,We can't stop.
S06E01,The Red Woman,113,We have to cross here.
S06E01,The Red Woman,114,I can't.
S06E01,The Red Woman,115,It's the only way to throw off the hounds.
S06E01,The Red Woman,116,But it's too cold. I can't. I won't make it. I'll die.
S06E01,The Red Woman,117,I've seen what his hounds do to a person.
S06E01,The Red Woman,118,This way is better.
S06E01,The Red Woman,119,Over here. Come on.
S06E01,The Red Woman,120,Sansa.
S06E01,The Red Woman,121,Sansa.
S06E01,The Red Woman,122,<i>Tell them to settle down!</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,123,Stay here. I'll lure them away.
S06E01,The Red Woman,124,"No, I won't make it without you."
S06E01,The Red Woman,125,You will.
S06E01,The Red Woman,126,"Go north, only north."
S06E01,The Red Woman,127,Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.
S06E01,The Red Woman,128,He'll help you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,129,"See somebody, eh?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,130,- There they are! - Get them!
S06E01,The Red Woman,131,Where is Lady Bolton?
S06E01,The Red Woman,132,- Dead. - Liar.
S06E01,The Red Woman,133,<i>She broke her leg</i> <i>jumping from the ramparts.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,134,I left her to die in the snow.
S06E01,The Red Woman,135,Got something! Run!
S06E01,The Red Woman,136,<i>Hyah!</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,137,Resist. Stay.
S06E01,The Red Woman,138,<i>Stay.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,139,I can't wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
S06E01,The Red Woman,140,<i>Rider! Who is it?</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,141,It's a bloody woman.
S06E01,The Red Woman,142,No! Please!
S06E01,The Red Woman,143,"Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again."
S06E01,The Red Woman,144,I will shield your back and keep your counsel
S06E01,The Red Woman,145,and give my life for yours if need be.
S06E01,The Red Woman,146,I swear it by the old gods and the new.
S06E01,The Red Woman,147,And I vow...
S06E01,The Red Woman,148,that you shall always have a place by my hearth
S06E01,The Red Woman,149,<i>and...</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,150,Meat and mead at my table.
S06E01,The Red Woman,151,...meat and mead at my table.
S06E01,The Red Woman,152,And I pledge to ask no service of you
S06E01,The Red Woman,153,that might bring you dishonor.
S06E01,The Red Woman,154,<i>I swear it by the old gods</i> <i>and the new.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,155,Arise.
S06E01,The Red Woman,156,"<i>Your Grace, I'm sorry</i> <i>to disturb you.</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,157,A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.
S06E01,The Red Woman,158,Myrcella.
S06E01,The Red Woman,159,Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
S06E01,The Red Woman,160,Mother.
S06E01,The Red Woman,161,All I could think about when she died
S06E01,The Red Woman,162,was what would happen to her now.
S06E01,The Red Woman,163,"Every day, every night,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,164,what does Mama look like now?
S06E01,The Red Woman,165,Has she started to bloat?
S06E01,The Red Woman,166,Has her skin turned black?
S06E01,The Red Woman,167,Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?
S06E01,The Red Woman,168,I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.
S06E01,The Red Woman,169,I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
S06E01,The Red Woman,170,"Shh, shh. Don't think about it."
S06E01,The Red Woman,171,I have to.
S06E01,The Red Woman,172,I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.
S06E01,The Red Woman,173,She's not suffering. She's gone.
S06E01,The Red Woman,174,No one can hurt her anymore.
S06E01,The Red Woman,175,She was good.
S06E01,The Red Woman,176,"From her first breath, she was so sweet."
S06E01,The Red Woman,177,I don't know where she came from.
S06E01,The Red Woman,178,She was nothing like me.
S06E01,The Red Woman,179,"No meanness, no jealousy, just good."
S06E01,The Red Woman,180,I know.
S06E01,The Red Woman,181,"<i>I thought if I could</i> <i>make something so good,</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,182,so pure...
S06E01,The Red Woman,183,- maybe I'm not a monster. - <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,184,She was my daughter and I failed her.
S06E01,The Red Woman,185,"No, I knew this would happen."
S06E01,The Red Woman,186,The witch told me years ago.
S06E01,The Red Woman,187,She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.
S06E01,The Red Woman,188,"""And gold their shrouds."""
S06E01,The Red Woman,189,Everything she said came true.
S06E01,The Red Woman,190,You couldn't have stopped it.
S06E01,The Red Woman,191,It's prophecy. It's fate.
S06E01,The Red Woman,192,- You don't believe that. - Of course I do.
S06E01,The Red Woman,193,You told me yourself when Father died.
S06E01,The Red Woman,194,You said we had to stay together.
S06E01,The Red Woman,195,"You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours."
S06E01,The Red Woman,196,"That was a prophecy, too."
S06E01,The Red Woman,197,I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.
S06E01,The Red Woman,198,Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate.
S06E01,The Red Woman,199,Fuck everyone who isn't us.
S06E01,The Red Woman,200,"We're the only ones who matter,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,201,the only ones in this world.
S06E01,The Red Woman,202,"And everything they've taken from us,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,203,we're going to take back and more.
S06E01,The Red Woman,204,We're going to take everything there is.
S06E01,The Red Woman,205,"""The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men."
S06E01,The Red Woman,206,"They scream in agony and their shame is so great,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,207,"they do not feel the flames,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,208,for now they see if not for a single sin
S06E01,The Red Woman,209,"they concealed, they were saved."""
S06E01,The Red Woman,210,I'd like to see my brother.
S06E01,The Red Woman,211,- Confess. - Please.
S06E01,The Red Woman,212,How is he? At least tell me that.
S06E01,The Red Woman,213,Confess.
S06E01,The Red Woman,214,I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
S06E01,The Red Woman,215,<i>Sinners</i> <i>don't make demands.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,216,They make confessions.
S06E01,The Red Woman,217,Septa Unella.
S06E01,The Red Woman,218,Our other guests need you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,219,There.
S06E01,The Red Woman,220,Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.
S06E01,The Red Woman,221,I'll speak with her.
S06E01,The Red Woman,222,"My brother, can you tell me how he is?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,223,It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.
S06E01,The Red Woman,224,Your husband misses you dearly.
S06E01,The Red Woman,225,The love between a man and wife is sacred.
S06E01,The Red Woman,226,It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.
S06E01,The Red Woman,227,But sin leads us away from the sacred.
S06E01,The Red Woman,228,And only confession can purge sin.
S06E01,The Red Woman,229,I have nothing to confess.
S06E01,The Red Woman,230,So you believe you are pure?
S06E01,The Red Woman,231,Perfect?
S06E01,The Red Woman,232,Wholly without sin?
S06E01,The Red Woman,233,None of us are.
S06E01,The Red Woman,234,You have started down the path.
S06E01,The Red Woman,235,But you have many miles to go.
S06E01,The Red Woman,236,I always envied Oberyn.
S06E01,The Red Woman,237,He lived.
S06E01,The Red Woman,238,He truly lived.
S06E01,The Red Woman,239,Sailed around the world.
S06E01,The Red Woman,240,Fought men from every country.
S06E01,The Red Woman,241,Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
S06E01,The Red Woman,242,- And men. - And men.
S06E01,The Red Woman,243,He experienced everything
S06E01,The Red Woman,244,while I sat here in Dorne
S06E01,The Red Woman,245,trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.
S06E01,The Red Woman,246,But that is life.
S06E01,The Red Woman,247,We each have our roles.
S06E01,The Red Woman,248,Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.
S06E01,The Red Woman,249,And I was born to rule.
S06E01,The Red Woman,250,The gods are not fools.
S06E01,The Red Woman,251,You would have been a lousy adventurer.
S06E01,The Red Woman,252,"And Oberyn, pfft,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,253,he would have been a terrible ruler.
S06E01,The Red Woman,254,"Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,255,<i>Prince Doran.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,256,The Princess Myrcella.
S06E01,The Red Woman,257,When was the last time you left this palace?
S06E01,The Red Woman,258,You don't know your own people.
S06E01,The Red Woman,259,<i>Their disgust for you.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,260,"Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing."
S06E01,The Red Woman,261,"Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing."
S06E01,The Red Woman,262,You're not a Dornishman.
S06E01,The Red Woman,263,You're not our prince.
S06E01,The Red Woman,264,My son Trystane...
S06E01,The Red Woman,265,Your son is weak just like you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,266,And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
S06E01,The Red Woman,267,I told you I'm not hungry.
S06E01,The Red Woman,268,We're not here to feed you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,269,We're here to kill you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,270,You want her to do it or me?
S06E01,The Red Woman,271,We are family. I don't want to hurt you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,272,Her or me?
S06E01,The Red Woman,273,You.
S06E01,The Red Woman,274,Good.
S06E01,The Red Woman,275,Smart boy.
S06E01,The Red Woman,276,"You're a greedy bitch, you know that?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,277,We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city
S06E01,The Red Woman,278,from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
S06E01,The Red Woman,279,We'll be fine.
S06E01,The Red Woman,280,We're dressed like common merchants.
S06E01,The Red Woman,281,You walk like a rich person.
S06E01,The Red Woman,282,You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
S06E01,The Red Woman,283,You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property.
S06E01,The Red Woman,284,I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
S06E01,The Red Woman,285,It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore.
S06E01,The Red Woman,286,Because you have no cock.
S06E01,The Red Woman,287,She thinks you want to eat her baby.
S06E01,The Red Woman,288,- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian. <i>- I know what mhysa means.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,289,- Who wrote it? - Hard to know.
S06E01,The Red Woman,290,Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
S06E01,The Red Woman,291,The Sons of the Harpy?
S06E01,The Red Woman,292,Very possibly.
S06E01,The Red Woman,293,"Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,294,told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.
S06E01,The Red Woman,295,You can see why they're unhappy.
S06E01,The Red Woman,296,"Of course,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,297,it could also be the freed men.
S06E01,The Red Woman,298,Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
S06E01,The Red Woman,299,She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
S06E01,The Red Woman,300,It's a problem.
S06E01,The Red Woman,301,Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.
S06E01,The Red Woman,302,"Whoever you are, wherever you go,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,303,someone in this city wants to murder you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,304,We can't fight an enemy we don't know.
S06E01,The Red Woman,305,The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack
S06E01,The Red Woman,306,"in the fighting pits very carefully,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,307,which means they take orders from someone.
S06E01,The Red Woman,308,And have you started looking for that someone?
S06E01,The Red Woman,309,My little birds have already taken wing.
S06E01,The Red Woman,310,"Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks."
S06E01,The Red Woman,311,"Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon."
S06E01,The Red Woman,312,Goat?
S06E01,The Red Woman,313,Ram.
S06E01,The Red Woman,314,You think our friend got him?
S06E01,The Red Woman,315,Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.
S06E01,The Red Woman,316,"We're on the right path, then."
S06E01,The Red Woman,317,Perhaps she's tired of being queen.
S06E01,The Red Woman,318,I don't think she likes it very much.
S06E01,The Red Woman,319,She's too smart to like it.
S06E01,The Red Woman,320,"Maybe she's flown somewhere else,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,321,somewhere far away from men like us.
S06E01,The Red Woman,322,I've been all over the world.
S06E01,The Red Woman,323,There's no escaping men like us.
S06E01,The Red Woman,324,"There's no escaping her, eh?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,325,You keep coming back. Why?
S06E01,The Red Woman,326,You know why.
S06E01,The Red Woman,327,Isn't it frustrating
S06E01,The Red Woman,328,wanting someone who doesn't want you back?
S06E01,The Red Woman,329,Of course it is.
S06E01,The Red Woman,330,You're a romantic. I admire that.
S06E01,The Red Woman,331,"Sometimes I look at you and I think,"
S06E01,The Red Woman,332,"""So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."""
S06E01,The Red Woman,333,If you grow old.
S06E01,The Red Woman,334,If I grow old.
S06E01,The Red Woman,335,I hope I do.
S06E01,The Red Woman,336,I want to see what the world looks like
S06E01,The Red Woman,337,when she's done conquering it.
S06E01,The Red Woman,338,So do I.
S06E01,The Red Woman,339,"Huh, an army?"
S06E01,The Red Woman,340,Not an army.
S06E01,The Red Woman,341,A horde.
S06E01,The Red Woman,342,Dothraki?
S06E01,The Red Woman,343,They have her.
S06E01,The Red Woman,344,No.
S06E01,The Red Woman,345,<i>But there has to be a price</i> <i>to pay for everything.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,346,"<i>I know, but have you tried</i> <i>telling him that?</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,347,Thank you.
S06E01,The Red Woman,348,Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?
S06E01,The Red Woman,349,"<i>- Probably had it coming.</i> <i>- Maybe so,</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,350,<i>but I'm not risking it.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,351,<i>- Just can't do it.</i> <i>- All right.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,352,<i>Honesty as well.</i> <i>He gets it.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,353,"<i>Are you listening,</i> <i>blind girl?</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,354,Do you hear them talking?
S06E01,The Red Woman,355,<i>Do any of them</i> <i>talk to you?</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,356,<i>No.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,357,So sad.
S06E01,The Red Woman,358,"Stand and fight, blind girl."
S06E01,The Red Woman,359,I can't see.
S06E01,The Red Woman,360,"That's your problem, not mine."
S06E01,The Red Woman,361,See you tomorrow.
S06E01,The Red Woman,362,"Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight."
S06E01,The Red Woman,363,We are both anointed knights.
S06E01,The Red Woman,364,"Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear."
S06E01,The Red Woman,365,<i>I will grant amnesty</i> <i>to all brothers</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,366,<i>who throw down their arms</i> <i>before nightfall.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,367,"<i>And you, Ser Davos,</i> <i>I will allow you to travel south</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,368,a free man with a fresh horse.
S06E01,The Red Woman,369,<i>And some mutton.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,370,<i>I'd like some mutton.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,371,- What? - I'm not much of a hunter.
S06E01,The Red Woman,372,I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving.
S06E01,The Red Woman,373,We'll give you food.
S06E01,The Red Woman,374,You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.
S06E01,The Red Woman,375,"<i>Or you can leave her here with us,</i> <i>whichever you choose.</i>"
S06E01,The Red Woman,376,But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.
S06E01,The Red Woman,377,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
S06E01,The Red Woman,378,We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.
S06E01,The Red Woman,379,"Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life."
S06E01,The Red Woman,380,"In my learned opinion, we open that door--"
S06E01,The Red Woman,381,And they'll slaughter us all.
S06E01,The Red Woman,382,"They want to come in, they're gonna come in."
S06E01,The Red Woman,383,"Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them."
S06E01,The Red Woman,384,<i>Edd is our only chance.</i>
S06E01,The Red Woman,385,It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.
S06E01,The Red Woman,386,There's always the Red Woman.

S06E02,Home,5,Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell.
S06E02,Home,6,They were all so happy.
S06E02,Home,7,So were you once.
S06E02,Home,8,Stop showing off.
S06E02,Home,9,Lyanna!
S06E02,Home,10,My Aunt Lyanna.
S06E02,Home,11,<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>
S06E02,Home,12,My father never talked about her.

S06E02,Home,21,Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.
S06E02,Home,22,"And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady."
S06E02,Home,23,Hodor talks?
S06E02,Home,24,"You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis."
S06E02,Home,25,"Come along, now. It's no place for you."
S06E02,Home,26,"Oh, Nan, look at the size of him."
S06E02,Home,27,"If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable."

S06E02,Home,29,So leave him be.
S06E02,Home,30,It is time to go.
S06E02,Home,31,"Please, a little longer."
S06E02,Home,32,You finally show me something I care about

S06E02,Home,34,"It is beautiful beneath the sea,"

S06E02,Home,59,"<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>"
S06E02,Home,60,Open the door and the men inside
S06E02,Home,61,can rejoin their brothers in peace.
S06E02,Home,62,We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.
S06E02,Home,63,Nobody needs to die tonight.
S06E02,Home,64,I've never been much of a fighter.
S06E02,Home,65,Apologies for what you're about to see.
S06E02,Home,66,Come on.
S06E02,Home,67,Attack!
S06E02,Home,68,"Fight, you cowards!"
S06E02,Home,69,You fucking traitor.
S06E02,Home,70,The only traitors here are the ones
S06E02,Home,71,who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart.
S06E02,Home,72,For thousands of years the Night's Watch
S06E02,Home,73,has held Castle Black against the wildlings.
S06E02,Home,74,Until you.
S06E02,Home,75,Throw them into the cells where they belong.
S06E02,Home,76,<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>
S06E02,Home,77,I'll have my men get the wood for a fire.
S06E02,Home,78,Bodies to burn.
S06E02,Home,79,"<i> Shh, hey.</i>"
S06E02,Home,80,"Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei,"
S06E02,Home,81,tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.
S06E02,Home,82,All of a sudden she looks my way.
S06E02,Home,83,"Gives me a little smile like, ""Well?"""
S06E02,Home,84,"So, all right, you know, I've never been shy"
S06E02,Home,85,"and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out."
S06E02,Home,86,She's never seen anything like it.
S06E02,Home,87,"I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear,"
S06E02,Home,88,Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.
S06E02,Home,89,Ooh!
S06E02,Home,90,She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.
S06E02,Home,91,"Well, you all know me."
S06E02,Home,92,You know I wouldn't lie about this.
S06E02,Home,93,Get out of my way.
S06E02,Home,94,"King's orders, Your Grace."
S06E02,Home,95,What are the king's orders?
S06E02,Home,96,"He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace,"
S06E02,Home,97,for your own protection.
S06E02,Home,98,You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?
S06E02,Home,99,"Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass."
S06E02,Home,100,I would like to speak to my son.
S06E02,Home,101,"He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace."
S06E02,Home,102,She grew up.
S06E02,Home,103,<i>Almost.</i>
S06E02,Home,104,Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?
S06E02,Home,105,I expect it was Mother.
S06E02,Home,106,Your mother wouldn't do that.
S06E02,Home,107,"Yes, she would."
S06E02,Home,108,Are you angry with her?
S06E02,Home,109,- Of course not. - Then why didn't you let her come?
S06E02,Home,110,She has every right to be here.
S06E02,Home,111,They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.
S06E02,Home,112,If she had tried--
S06E02,Home,113,They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.
S06E02,Home,114,Not while I'm here.
S06E02,Home,115,Why haven't you gone to see her?
S06E02,Home,116,"Everything she endured, she did it for you."
S06E02,Home,117,Don't you think I know that?
S06E02,Home,118,I'm sorry.
S06E02,Home,119,But I can't.
S06E02,Home,120,Why not?
S06E02,Home,121,"When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery,"
S06E02,Home,122,what did I do?
S06E02,Home,123,"When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,"
S06E02,Home,124,what did I do?
S06E02,Home,125,We all fail sometimes.
S06E02,Home,126,The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.
S06E02,Home,127,"If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother,"
S06E02,Home,128,what good am I?
S06E02,Home,129,Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.
S06E02,Home,130,Your Grace.
S06E02,Home,131,Lord Commander.
S06E02,Home,132,I want to see my wife.
S06E02,Home,133,The gods wait for Queen Margaery
S06E02,Home,134,to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.
S06E02,Home,135,The king must wait as well.
S06E02,Home,136,"Go and see your mother, Tommen."
S06E02,Home,137,You're a bold man.
S06E02,Home,138,On the contrary.
S06E02,Home,139,I fear a great deal.
S06E02,Home,140,"The Father, the Mother,"
S06E02,Home,141,the Warrior.
S06E02,Home,142,Do you know why we use these stones?
S06E02,Home,143,To remind us not to fear death.
S06E02,Home,144,We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.
S06E02,Home,145,You must long for the next life.
S06E02,Home,146,"In truth, I fear that, too."
S06E02,Home,147,You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.
S06E02,Home,148,Your sister sought the gods' mercy
S06E02,Home,149,and atoned for her sin.
S06E02,Home,150,What about my sins?
S06E02,Home,151,I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back.
S06E02,Home,152,I killed my own cousin.
S06E02,Home,153,"When the gods judged my brother guilty,"
S06E02,Home,154,I helped him escape their justice.
S06E02,Home,155,What atonement do I deserve?
S06E02,Home,156,You would spill blood in this holy place?
S06E02,Home,157,"Oh, the gods won't mind."
S06E02,Home,158,They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.
S06E02,Home,159,"Go on, then."
S06E02,Home,160,I deserve it. We all do.
S06E02,Home,161,"We are weak, vain creatures."
S06E02,Home,162,We live only by the Mother's mercy.
S06E02,Home,163,They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.
S06E02,Home,164,I don't.
S06E02,Home,165,They'd never reach me before you struck.
S06E02,Home,166,I've fought against worse odds.
S06E02,Home,167,No doubt many of us would fall.
S06E02,Home,168,"But who are we, hmm?"
S06E02,Home,169,"We have no names, no family."
S06E02,Home,170,Every one of us is poor and powerless.
S06E02,Home,171,"And yet together,"
S06E02,Home,172,we can overthrow an empire.
S06E02,Home,173,<i>Mother.</i>
S06E02,Home,174,Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?
S06E02,Home,175,Gold.
S06E02,Home,176,Good. It was always her color.
S06E02,Home,177,I'm sorry for keeping you here.
S06E02,Home,178,"<i>I shouldn't have, but I was--</i>"
S06E02,Home,179,I didn't want to lose you again.
S06E02,Home,180,I understand.
S06E02,Home,181,I'm glad to see you.
S06E02,Home,182,I know I should have come sooner.
S06E02,Home,183,I wanted to. I was wrong.
S06E02,Home,184,It's all right.
S06E02,Home,185,"No, it isn't."
S06E02,Home,186,I should have executed all of them.
S06E02,Home,187,I should have pulled down the sept
S06E02,Home,188,"onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you,"
S06E02,Home,189,as you would have for me.
S06E02,Home,190,You raised me to be strong...
S06E02,Home,191,and I wasn't.
S06E02,Home,192,But I want to be.
S06E02,Home,193,Help me.
S06E02,Home,194,Always.
S06E02,Home,195,"If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time."
S06E02,Home,196,Meaning no offense.
S06E02,Home,197,"He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes."
S06E02,Home,198,I do not make dwarf jokes.
S06E02,Home,199,You think them.
S06E02,Home,200,"So, the fleet. It's been burned."
S06E02,Home,201,"We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything."
S06E02,Home,202,Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.
S06E02,Home,203,Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.
S06E02,Home,204,Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
S06E02,Home,205,The Masters have retaken both cities.
S06E02,Home,206,"Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers."
S06E02,Home,207,What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
S06E02,Home,208,They are not eating.
S06E02,Home,209,They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
S06E02,Home,210,Daenerys is the dragon queen.
S06E02,Home,211,"Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious."
S06E02,Home,212,"If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?"
S06E02,Home,213,Dragons do not do well in captivity.
S06E02,Home,214,- How do you know this? - That's what I do.
S06E02,Home,215,I drink and I know things.
S06E02,Home,216,The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros
S06E02,Home,217,ranged over hundreds of miles.
S06E02,Home,218,Then Daenerys's ancestors
S06E02,Home,219,started chaining them up in pens.
S06E02,Home,220,"A few generations later,"
S06E02,Home,221,the last dragons were no larger than cats.
S06E02,Home,222,They must be unchained or they'll waste away.
S06E02,Home,223,"Missandei,"
S06E02,Home,224,how many times were you in the company of these dragons?
S06E02,Home,225,- Many times. - And did they ever harm you?
S06E02,Home,226,Never.
S06E02,Home,227,Dragons are intelligent.
S06E02,Home,228,More intelligent than men according to some maesters.
S06E02,Home,229,They have affection for their friends
S06E02,Home,230,and fury for their enemies.
S06E02,Home,231,- I am their friend. - Do they know that?
S06E02,Home,232,They will. It's time they had their supper.
S06E02,Home,233,I'm friends with your mother.
S06E02,Home,234,I'm here to help.
S06E02,Home,235,Don't eat the help.
S06E02,Home,236,"When I was a child,"
S06E02,Home,237,an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.
S06E02,Home,238,I begged him for one of you.
S06E02,Home,239,"""It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,"" I told him."
S06E02,Home,240,"""It could be little like me."""
S06E02,Home,241,Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.
S06E02,Home,242,Then my father told me
S06E02,Home,243,the last dragon had died a century ago.
S06E02,Home,244,I cried myself to sleep that night.
S06E02,Home,245,But here you are.
S06E02,Home,246,"Next time I have an idea like that,"
S06E02,Home,247,punch me in the face.
S06E02,Home,248,What's your name?
S06E02,Home,249,What's your name?
S06E02,Home,250,- No one. - I don't believe that.
S06E02,Home,251,You don't believe that.
S06E02,Home,252,Who are you?
S06E02,Home,253,No one.
S06E02,Home,254,"If a girl says her name,"
S06E02,Home,255,a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.
S06E02,Home,256,A girl has no name.
S06E02,Home,257,"If a girl says her name,"
S06E02,Home,258,a man will feed her tonight.
S06E02,Home,259,A girl has no name.
S06E02,Home,260,"If a girl says her name,"
S06E02,Home,261,a man will give her eyes back.
S06E02,Home,262,A girl has no name.
S06E02,Home,263,Come.
S06E02,Home,264,Leave it.
S06E02,Home,265,<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>
S06E02,Home,266,We came upon the bodies on our way here.
S06E02,Home,267,Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
S06E02,Home,268,They obviously had help.
S06E02,Home,269,I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.
S06E02,Home,270,"Thank you for this report, Lord Karstark."
S06E02,Home,271,We know where she's going.
S06E02,Home,272,Her brother's at Castle Black.
S06E02,Home,273,Ned Stark's last surviving son?
S06E02,Home,274,"Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark."
S06E02,Home,275,"So was I, Father."
S06E02,Home,276,Your hold on the North will never be secure
S06E02,Home,277,as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
S06E02,Home,278,Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.
S06E02,Home,279,And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves.
S06E02,Home,280,"With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow--"
S06E02,Home,281,Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
S06E02,Home,282,You'd unite every house in the North against us.
S06E02,Home,283,We don't need every house in the North.
S06E02,Home,284,"<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks</i>"
S06E02,Home,285,command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.
S06E02,Home,286,"With their support, none could challenge us."
S06E02,Home,287,The Starks lost my house the day King Robb cut off my father's head.
S06E02,Home,288,It's time for new blood in the North.
S06E02,Home,289,"If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog,"
S06E02,Home,290,you'll be treated as a mad dog.
S06E02,Home,291,Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.
S06E02,Home,292,<i>My lords.</i>
S06E02,Home,293,<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>
S06E02,Home,294,A boy.
S06E02,Home,295,<i>Red-cheeked and healthy.</i>
S06E02,Home,296,"My congratulations, Lord Bolton."
S06E02,Home,297,"Congratulations, Father."
S06E02,Home,298,I look forward to meeting my new brother.
S06E02,Home,299,You'll always be my firstborn.
S06E02,Home,300,Thank you for saying that.
S06E02,Home,301,It means a great deal to me.
S06E02,Home,302,"Maester Wolkan,"
S06E02,Home,303,<i>send ravens to all the northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead.</i>
S06E02,Home,304,Poisoned by our enemies.
S06E02,Home,305,How did he die?
S06E02,Home,306,Poisoned by his enemies.
S06E02,Home,307,You're talking to your lord. Use respect.
S06E02,Home,308,"Forgive me, my lord."
S06E02,Home,309,Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
S06E02,Home,310,"She's resting, my lord."
S06E02,Home,311,"At once, my lord."
S06E02,Home,312,There he is.
S06E02,Home,313,Isn't he wonderful?
S06E02,Home,314,May I hold him?
S06E02,Home,315,Of-- of course.
S06E02,Home,316,Little brother.
S06E02,Home,317,Lord Bolton sent for us.
S06E02,Home,318,Have you seen him?
S06E02,Home,319,"Of course. Follow me, Mother."
S06E02,Home,320,Where is Lord Bolton?
S06E02,Home,321,Down!
S06E02,Home,322,"<i> It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>"
S06E02,Home,323,"<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.</i>"
S06E02,Home,324,"Ramsay, where is your father?"
S06E02,Home,325,Ramsay.
S06E02,Home,326,Where is Lord Bolton?
S06E02,Home,327,I am Lord Bolton.
S06E02,Home,328,Ramsay.
S06E02,Home,329,"Ramsay, please."
S06E02,Home,330,I'll leave Winterfell. I'll go back to the Riverlands.
S06E02,Home,331,Please.
S06E02,Home,332,Ramsay.
S06E02,Home,333,He's your brother.
S06E02,Home,334,I prefer being an only child.
S06E02,Home,335,<i>I saw her with a man.</i>
S06E02,Home,336,I don't think he hurt her.
S06E02,Home,337,"She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her."
S06E02,Home,338,You don't know which way she went?
S06E02,Home,339,I spent three days looking for her.
S06E02,Home,340,She disappeared.
S06E02,Home,341,How'd she look?
S06E02,Home,342,She looked good.
S06E02,Home,343,She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.
S06E02,Home,344,"No, she wouldn't be."
S06E02,Home,345,What happened at Winterfell?
S06E02,Home,346,I should have gone with you while I had the chance.
S06E02,Home,347,"It was a difficult choice, my lady."
S06E02,Home,348,We've all had to make difficult choices.
S06E02,Home,349,We shouldn't be lighting fires.
S06E02,Home,350,It's not safe.
S06E02,Home,351,He won't stop hunting us.
S06E02,Home,352,We just have to make it to Castle Black.
S06E02,Home,353,"Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us."
S06E02,Home,354,Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
S06E02,Home,355,I won't let him.
S06E02,Home,356,I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
S06E02,Home,357,And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.
S06E02,Home,358,"And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded."
S06E02,Home,359,"And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed."
S06E02,Home,360,"When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven."
S06E02,Home,361,I don't want to be forgiven.
S06E02,Home,362,I can never make amends to your family
S06E02,Home,363,for the things I've done.
S06E02,Home,364,They'll keep you safer than I ever could.
S06E02,Home,365,You're not coming with us?
S06E02,Home,366,I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.
S06E02,Home,367,I would have died to get you there.
S06E02,Home,368,May I take one of the horses?
S06E02,Home,369,Where will you go?
S06E02,Home,370,Home.
S06E02,Home,371,<i>The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>
S06E02,Home,372,And the ironborn who held it?
S06E02,Home,373,They died fighting to a man.
S06E02,Home,374,What is dead may never die.
S06E02,Home,375,What is dead may never die.
S06E02,Home,376,But they did
S06E02,Home,377,and our invasion died with them.
S06E02,Home,378,Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
S06E02,Home,379,Then we will take more.
S06E02,Home,380,Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
S06E02,Home,381,Because I order it.
S06E02,Home,382,"We can defeat anyone at sea,"
S06E02,Home,383,but we'll never hold lands and castles
S06E02,Home,384,against mainland armies.
S06E02,Home,385,"Not if our captains defy my orders,"
S06E02,Home,386,"abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions."
S06E02,Home,387,I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
S06E02,Home,388,Then where is he?
S06E02,Home,389,Where is your kingdom?
S06E02,Home,390,We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war.
S06E02,Home,391,That war is over.
S06E02,Home,392,"The last time we provoked them too far,"
S06E02,Home,393,I watched from that window as they breached our walls
S06E02,Home,394,<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>
S06E02,Home,395,<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>
S06E02,Home,396,And I lost three sons.
S06E02,Home,397,"The War of the Five Kings, they call it."
S06E02,Home,398,"Well, the other four are dead."
S06E02,Home,399,"When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want."
S06E02,Home,400,"But for now, shut your mouth and obey"
S06E02,Home,401,or I will make another heir who will.
S06E02,Home,402,Let me pass.
S06E02,Home,403,"You fool, move aside for your king."
S06E02,Home,404,"Haven't I always, brother?"
S06E02,Home,405,I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
S06E02,Home,406,What is dead may never die.
S06E02,Home,407,Has the custom changed since I've been gone?
S06E02,Home,408,Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?
S06E02,Home,409,You can mock our god without my help.
S06E02,Home,410,I don't mock the Drowned God.
S06E02,Home,411,I am the Drowned God.
S06E02,Home,412,"From Oldtown to Qarth,"
S06E02,Home,413,"when men see my sails, they pray."
S06E02,Home,414,"You're old, brother."
S06E02,Home,415,<i>You've had your time.</i>
S06E02,Home,416,Now let another rule.
S06E02,Home,417,I heard you lost your mind
S06E02,Home,418,during a storm on the Jade Sea.
S06E02,Home,419,They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
S06E02,Home,420,They did.
S06E02,Home,421,"And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues."
S06E02,Home,422,I needed silence.
S06E02,Home,423,What kind of an ironborn
S06E02,Home,424,loses his senses during a storm?
S06E02,Home,425,"I am the storm, brother."
S06E02,Home,426,The first storm and the last.
S06E02,Home,427,And you're in my way.
S06E02,Home,428,"Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves."
S06E02,Home,429,Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.
S06E02,Home,430,Pull his bones down to your depths
S06E02,Home,431,to rest beside his ancestors and his children.
S06E02,Home,432,What is dead may never die.
S06E02,Home,433,I'm going to find out who did this.
S06E02,Home,434,I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.
S06E02,Home,435,I swear it by the Salt Throne.
S06E02,Home,436,"The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,"
S06E02,Home,437,not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
S06E02,Home,438,My father would have wanted me to rule.
S06E02,Home,439,Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.
S06E02,Home,440,Perhaps you'll win.
S06E02,Home,441,Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.
S06E02,Home,442,And perhaps not.
S06E02,Home,443,Come in.
S06E02,Home,444,"I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt."
S06E02,Home,445,You interrupt nothing.
S06E02,Home,446,I assume you know why I'm here.
S06E02,Home,447,I will after you tell me.
S06E02,Home,448,It's about the Lord Commander.
S06E02,Home,449,The former Lord Commander.
S06E02,Home,450,Does he have to be?
S06E02,Home,451,What are you asking?
S06E02,Home,452,Do you know of any magic...
S06E02,Home,453,that could help him?
S06E02,Home,454,Bring him back?
S06E02,Home,455,"If you want to help him, leave him be."
S06E02,Home,456,Can it be done?
S06E02,Home,457,There are some with this power.
S06E02,Home,458,- <i>How?</i> - I don't know.
S06E02,Home,459,Have you seen it done?
S06E02,Home,460,"I met a man who came back from the dead,"
S06E02,Home,461,but the priest who did it--
S06E02,Home,462,it shouldn't have been possible.
S06E02,Home,463,But it was. It could be now.
S06E02,Home,464,Not for me.
S06E02,Home,465,Not for you?
S06E02,Home,466,I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.
S06E02,Home,467,I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
S06E02,Home,468,"Everything I believed,"
S06E02,Home,469,"the great victory I saw in the flames,"
S06E02,Home,470,all of it was a lie.
S06E02,Home,471,You were right all along.
S06E02,Home,472,The Lord never spoke to me.
S06E02,Home,473,"Fuck him, then."
S06E02,Home,474,Fuck all of them.
S06E02,Home,475,"I'm not a devout man, obviously."
S06E02,Home,476,"Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same."
S06E02,Home,477,I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.
S06E02,Home,478,I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
S06E02,Home,479,I never had this gift.
S06E02,Home,480,Have you ever tried?
S06E02,Home,481,Please.

S06E03,Oathbreaker,1,"Fidel33 May 9, 2016"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,2,"Easy, easy."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,3,Easy.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,4,What do you remember?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,5,They stabbed me.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,6,Olly...
S06E03,Oathbreaker,7,he put a knife in my heart.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,8,I shouldn't be here.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,9,The lady brought you back.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,10,"Afterwards, after they stabbed you,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,11,"after you died, where did you go?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,12,What did you see?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,13,Nothing.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,14,There was nothing at all.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,15,The Lord let you come back for a reason.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,16,"Stannis was not the prince who was promised,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,17,but someone has to be.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,18,Could you give us a moment?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,19,You were dead.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,20,And now you're not.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,21,"That's completely fucking mad, seems to me."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,22,I can only imagine how it seems to you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,23,I did what I thought was right.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,24,And I got murdered for it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,25,And now I'm back.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,26,Why?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,27,I don't know.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,28,Maybe we'll never know.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,29,What does it matter?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,30,You go on.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,31,You fight for as long as you can.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,32,You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,33,I don't know how to do that.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,34,"I thought I did, but..."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,35,I failed.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,36,Good.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,37,Now go fail again.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,38,They think you're some kind of god.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,39,The man who returned from the dead.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,40,I'm not a god.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,41,I know that.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,42,I saw your pecker.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,43,What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,44,Your eyes are still brown.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,45,Is that still you in there?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,46,I think so.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,47,Hold off on burning my body for now.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,48,That's funny.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,49,You sure that's still you in there?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,50,You all right?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,51,"Yes. Yes, I'm fine."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,52,Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see
S06E03,Oathbreaker,53,because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,54,I don't think so.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,55,"Sea, see."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,56,"They're spelled different, but they sound the same."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,57,"Yeah, they do."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,58,"It was before I learned how to read, obviously."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,59,"Sam, are you going to be sick?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,60,Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,61,I'm excited to see Oldtown.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,62,Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,63,Are you going to vomit again?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,64,"No. No, no, no."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,65,The Citadel doesn't admit women.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,66,There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,67,I stayed at Castle Black. There's no women allowed there.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,68,The Citadel isn't Castle Black.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,69,I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon
S06E03,Oathbreaker,70,to help me bend the rules.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,71,"I'll stay in Oldtown, then."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,72,By yourself?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,73,With a baby and no money?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,74,"So if we're not going to Oldtown,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,75,where are you taking me?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,76,To my home.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,77,Horn Hill.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,78,"My father's-- well, my father,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,79,but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,80,They'll take care of you both.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,81,"""Wherever you go, I go, too."""
S06E03,Oathbreaker,82,<i>That's what you said.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,83,I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,84,That's all I want--
S06E03,Oathbreaker,85,to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes
S06E03,Oathbreaker,86,so you'll be safe.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,87,Us and everyone else in the world.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,88,I don't care about them.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,89,"Well, no, I do, but I don't really."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,90,I care about you and him.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,91,"I know that, Sam."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,92,"And he does, too."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,93,You're the only one who ever has.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,94,"If you think it's for the best,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,95,we trust you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,96,I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,97,I'd never do that to the father of my son.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,98,That's my father.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,99,"The man beside him is Howland Reed,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,100,Meera's father.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,101,Ser Arthur Dayne.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,102,The Sword of the Morning.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,103,Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,104,Lord Stark.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,105,I looked for you on the Trident.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,106,We weren't there.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,107,Your friend the usurper
S06E03,Oathbreaker,108,would lie beneath the ground if we had been.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,109,The Mad King is dead.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,110,Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,111,Why weren't you there to protect your prince?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,112,Our prince wanted us here.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,113,Where's my sister?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,114,I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,115,And now it begins.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,116,No.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,117,Now it ends.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,118,He's better than my father.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,119,Far better.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,120,But Father beat him.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,121,Did he?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,122,I know he did.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,123,Heard the story a thousand times.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,124,He stabbed him in the back.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,125,What's in the tower?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,126,That's enough for one day.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,127,We'll visit again another time.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,128,- I want to see where he's going. - Time to go.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,129,Father!
S06E03,Oathbreaker,130,Why did you do that?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,131,Take me back there. I want to go back.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,132,No.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,133,- He heard me. - Maybe.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,134,- Maybe he heard the wind. - He heard me.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,135,The past is already written. The ink is dry.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,136,What's in that tower?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,137,<i>I want to go back there.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,138,"I've told you many times, stay too long"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,139,where you don't belong and you will never return.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,140,Why do I want to return?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,141,So I can be a cripple again?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,142,<i>So I can talk to an old man in a tree?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,143,"You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,144,watching the world from a distance
S06E03,Oathbreaker,145,as the roots grew through me?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,146,So why did you?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,147,I was waiting for you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,148,I don't want to be you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,149,I don't blame you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,150,You won't be here forever.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,151,You won't be an old man in a tree.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,152,"<i>But before you leave,</i>"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,153,you must learn.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,154,Learn what?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,155,Everything.

S06E03,Oathbreaker,191,"You look lovely today, my dear. You really do."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,192,How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,193,"If you're going to torture me,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,194,just call them back and get on with it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,195,I am not a torturer.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,196,Though it so often is what people deserve.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,197,And it does provide answers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,198,But they're usually the wrong answers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,199,My job is to find the right answers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,200,Do you know how I do that?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,201,I do it by making people happy.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,202,"I'd like to make you happy, Vala."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,203,"That's your name, isn't it, Vala?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,204,That's all right.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,205,I know who you are and what you've done.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,206,You've done a lot.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,207,"You've sacrificed your body for a cause,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,208,which is more than most people do.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,209,And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy
S06E03,Oathbreaker,210,murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,211,The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers
S06E03,Oathbreaker,212,brought here by a foreign queen
S06E03,Oathbreaker,213,to destroy our city and our history.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,214,I understand.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,215,"Well, that makes perfect sense"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,216,from your perspective.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,217,"I have a different perspective, of course."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,218,I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective
S06E03,Oathbreaker,219,just as I will try to see them from yours.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,220,Because that is the only way
S06E03,Oathbreaker,221,that I can make you and Dom happy.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,222,That is how you pronounce it-- Dom?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,223,I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,224,Such a handsome boy.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,225,"Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,226,"Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,227,"You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,228,Children are blameless.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,229,I have never hurt them.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,230,"Your boy is in no immediate danger,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,231,this I swear to you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,232,"But between us, dear,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,233,you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,234,We both know the penalty for that crime.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,235,How will poor Dom get on without his mother?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,236,And with his breathing problem.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,237,"If I tell you anything, they'll kill me."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,238,So either you kill me or they do.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,239,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,240,"There is a third option, though."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,241,A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,242,I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,243,I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,244,Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
S06E03,Oathbreaker,245,one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,246,Far too heavy for me.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,247,The boat sails at dawn.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,248,You need to decide now.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,249,A new life for you and Dom
S06E03,Oathbreaker,250,or...
S06E03,Oathbreaker,251,What should we do while we wait?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,252,"To pass the time, what should we do?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,253,<i>What should we talk about?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,254,You speak 19 languages.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,255,You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,256,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,257,What would you be talking about if I weren't here?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,258,Patrol.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,259,When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,260,What we see on patrol.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,261,Who we captured on patrol.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,262,That's good. That's very good.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,263,But that's a report.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,264,I was thinking more of a conversation.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,265,A wise man once said the true history of the world
S06E03,Oathbreaker,266,is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,267,Who said this?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,268,Me.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,269,Just now.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,270,"All right, no conversations."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,271,Let's play a game.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,272,"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,273,Games are for children.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,274,<i>My master Kraznys</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,275,would sometimes make us play games.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,276,"There, that's a start."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,277,"- Only the girls. - No, no, no."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,278,Not that. Of course not that.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,279,Innocent games. Fun games.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,280,Drinking games.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,281,<i>We do not drink.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,282,Until you do.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,283,All right. No drinking.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,284,We can play without drinking.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,285,It's a wonderful game. I invented it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,286,Here's how it works.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,287,I make a statement about your past.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,288,"If I'm wrong, I drink."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,289,And if I'm right--
S06E03,Oathbreaker,290,maybe we can't play without drinking.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,291,"Oh, you took your time."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,292,Sorry.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,293,I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,294,- Some things you can't rush. - You found out?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,295,The Good Masters of Astapor
S06E03,Oathbreaker,296,and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,297,With help from their friends in Volantis.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,298,<i>You see?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,299,You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,300,We only have to worry about
S06E03,Oathbreaker,301,the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,302,We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,303,We will do it again and execute the Masters.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,304,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,305,who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,306,"If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,307,We cannot.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,308,The Masters speak only one language.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,309,They spoke it to me for many years.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,310,<i>I know it better than my mother tongue.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,311,"If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,312,May it be the last thing they ever hear.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,313,You may be right.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,314,<i>So we will fight them?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,315,- Possibly. - Possibly?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,316,It's a conversation.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,317,"Tell me, can your little birds get a message"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,318,"to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,319,and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,320,"Of course. Men can be fickle,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,321,but birds I always trust.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,322,"Your eye looks much better, Arthur."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,323,How's your mother's jaw?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,324,Better.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,325,And your father?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,326,No one's seen him.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,327,And no one will.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,328,That worked out rather nicely.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,329,Will Lord Varys ever come back?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,330,I don't think so.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,331,Do you miss him?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,332,He was nice.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,333,He called us his little birds.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,334,He gave us sweets.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,335,It's funny you should mention that.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,336,Guess what I happened to find today.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,337,Candied plums from Dorne.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,338,"Now remember, if any of your friends"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,339,"like sweets or need help, they can always come to me."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,340,All I need in return are whispers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,341,<i>No need to be afraid.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,342,This is Ser Gregor.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,343,He's friends with all my friends.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,344,Run along now.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,345,Varys's little birds?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,346,"Your little birds now, Your Grace."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,347,What did you do to him exactly?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,348,I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,349,"Oh, a number of things."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,350,Does he understand what we're saying?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,351,"I mean, to the extent that he ever understood"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,352,complete sentences in the first place.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,353,He understands well enough.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,354,So tell him to march into the sept
S06E03,Oathbreaker,355,and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,356,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,357,Ser Gregor can't face them all.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,358,And he won't have to.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,359,He'll only have to face one.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,360,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,361,Not yet.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,362,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,363,Don't stop at the city.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,364,"I want little birds in Dorne,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,365,"in Highgarden, in the North."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,366,"If someone is planning on making our losses their gains,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,367,I want to hear it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,368,If someone is laughing at the queen
S06E03,Oathbreaker,369,"who walked naked through the streets covered in shit,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,370,I want to hear.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,371,I want to know who they are.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,372,I want to know where they are.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,373,"<i>As bad as Lord Varys was, Qyburn is worse.</i>"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,374,I told them all. I told them.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,375,"He's arrogant, dangerous."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,376,You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,377,And no one listened to my advice.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,378,<i>So here we are.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,379,And what he's done to Gregor Clegane
S06E03,Oathbreaker,380,<i>is an abomination.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,381,We never sanctioned this experiment.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,382,I for one think it will be in our best interest
S06E03,Oathbreaker,383,to have the beast dest--
S06E03,Oathbreaker,384,- Can I help you? - Why are you here?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,385,"- My mother-- - I was invited, my dear,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,386,"to help deal with several troublesome issues,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,387,such as the queen's imprisonment.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,388,Thank you for bringing it up.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,389,It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,390,Margaery is the queen.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,391,You are not the queen
S06E03,Oathbreaker,392,<i>because you're not married to the king.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,393,I do appreciate these things
S06E03,Oathbreaker,394,can get a bit confusing in your family.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,395,This is a small council meeting.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,396,You have no position on the small council.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,397,I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,398,The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
S06E03,Oathbreaker,399,does have a position on the small council.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,400,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,401,"Well, um..."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,402,I would say Ser Gerold Hightower
S06E03,Oathbreaker,403,had a seat on the Mad King's council.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,404,"<i>Of course, that was the Mad King.</i>"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,405,King Robert saw things differently.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,406,And King--
S06E03,Oathbreaker,407,"What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,408,Do you consider the murder of your own blood
S06E03,Oathbreaker,409,a troublesome issue?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,410,The same women who murdered Myrcella
S06E03,Oathbreaker,411,have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,412,We've got a lot to discuss.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,413,All of us together.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,414,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,415,"No, we cannot make you leave."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,416,And you cannot make us stay.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,417,Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,418,Your Grace.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,419,My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,420,"I'm sorry, Your Grace."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,421,That's not possible. Not yet.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,422,When will it be possible?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,423,When she's fully atoned for her sins.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,424,You cut off her hair and marched her naked
S06E03,Oathbreaker,425,through the streets in front of the whole city.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,426,That wasn't the full atonement?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,427,No.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,428,She must stand trial before seven septons
S06E03,Oathbreaker,429,so we can learn the true extent of her sins.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,430,I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,431,I am the king.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,432,You are.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,433,And what does that mean to you?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,434,<i>It means a great deal to me.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,435,The Crown and the Faith
S06E03,Oathbreaker,436,are the twin pillars of the world.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,437,<i>Do you know who told me that?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,438,Your mother.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,439,My mother who is unclean?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,440,My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,441,How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,442,How did men and women
S06E03,Oathbreaker,443,"first come to feel the Mother's presence, hmm?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,444,It was through their own mothers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,445,There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei. You know that.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,446,"But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,447,Her love for you is more real
S06E03,Oathbreaker,448,than anything else in this world
S06E03,Oathbreaker,449,because it doesn't come from this world.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,450,But you know that.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,451,You've felt it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,452,You've seen her when she talks to you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,453,Yes.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,454,<i>It's a great gift.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,455,One I never had.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,456,Envy.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,457,One more thing for me to atone for.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,458,"Your Grace, do you-- may I?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,459,Do you mind?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,460,It's my knees.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,461,Of course.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,462,"When your mother made her walk of atonement,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,463,she did it to get back to you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,464,I still don't understand why you want to put her
S06E03,Oathbreaker,465,through any more than she's already endured.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,466,It's not what I want. It's what the gods want.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,467,<i>They make their will known to us and it's up to us</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,468,to either accept or reject it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,469,Please.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,470,"If we're to be just and good,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,471,"then we accept it, all of us, even kings."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,472,A true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,473,And no one is wiser than the gods.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,474,My grandfather once said something similar.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,475,Except for the part about the gods.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,476,The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,477,As they work through your mother.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,478,There's so much good in all of us.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,479,The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,480,Who are you?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,481,No one.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,482,<i>Who were you before you came here?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,483,<i>Arya Stark.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,484,<i>Tell me about Arya Stark's family.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,485,Her father was Eddard Stark.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,486,Her mother was Catelyn Stark.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,487,"She had one sister, Sansa,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,488,and four brothers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,489,Three brothers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,490,"<i>Robb, Bran, Rickon.</i>"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,491,And a half-brother Jon.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,492,And where are they now?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,493,<i>They may be dead for all a girl knows.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,494,Tell me about the Hound.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,495,<i>Also dead.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,496,<i>Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,497,He was not on her list anymore.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,498,She had taken him off it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,499,Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,500,<i>She did and she did not.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,501,She sounds confused.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,502,"Yes, she was."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,503,Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,504,<i>Cersei Lannister.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,505,<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,506,<i>Walder Frey.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,507,<i>That's a short list.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,508,<i>That can't be everyone you want to kill.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,509,Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,510,Which name would you like a girl to speak?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,511,"<i>If a girl tells me her name,</i>"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,512,I will give her eyes back.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,513,A girl has no name.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,514,Come.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,515,"If a girl is truly no one,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,516,<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,517,Who are you?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,518,No one.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,519,The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,520,Famously loyal to the Starks.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,521,"And you, Lord Karstark."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,522,"Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,523,But here we are. Times change.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,524,"When my father became Warden of the North,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,525,<i>your house refused to pledge their banners.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,526,Your father was a cunt.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,527,"My beloved father, the Warden--"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,528,Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,529,<i>I might have done the same to my father</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,530,if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,531,My father was poisoned by our enemies.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,532,Mmm.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,533,"Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,534,The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,535,We're farther north than any of you fuckers.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,536,"<i>Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.</i>"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,537,I like fighting wildlings. Been doing it all my life.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,538,But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,539,So now you've come seeking help?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,540,We need to help each other.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,541,"The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,542,Won't take them long to get here.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,543,You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,544,"If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,545,<i>He knows this place better than we ever will.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,546,Pledge your banners to House Bolton.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,547,Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North
S06E03,Oathbreaker,548,and we will fight together to destroy the bastard
S06E03,Oathbreaker,549,and all his wildling friends.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,550,I'm not kissing your fucking hand.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,551,Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,552,I'm not doing that either.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,553,Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,554,Your father honored tradition.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,555,<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,556,Called him King of the North.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,557,<i>Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,558,Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,559,Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,560,I've got a gift for you.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,561,"A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,562,"A girl, aye."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,563,<i>A wild one.</i>
S06E03,Oathbreaker,564,I like them wild.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,565,"And the boy, nice and young."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,566,The way Karstark likes them.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,567,Who's this?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,568,Rickon Stark.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,569,How do I know that's Rickon Stark?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,570,"Welcome home, Lord Stark."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,571,It's time.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,572,"If you have any last words, now is the time."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,573,You shouldn't be alive.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,574,It's not right.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,575,Neither was killing me.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,576,My mother's still living at White Harbor.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,577,Could you write her?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,578,Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,579,"I had a choice, Lord Commander."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,580,Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,581,You brought an army of wildlings into our lands.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,582,An army of murderers and raiders.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,583,"If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up,"
S06E03,Oathbreaker,584,I pray I'd make the right choice again.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,585,"I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,586,"I fought, I lost."
S06E03,Oathbreaker,587,Now I rest.

S06E03,Oathbreaker,589,you'll be fighting their battles forever.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,590,We should burn the bodies.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,591,You should.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,592,What do you want me to do with this?
S06E03,Oathbreaker,593,Wear it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,594,Burn it.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,595,Whatever you want.
S06E03,Oathbreaker,596,You have Castle Black.

S06E04,Book of the Stranger,4,South.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,5,What are you gonna do?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,6,Get warm.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,7,I was with you at Hardhome.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,8,We saw what's out there.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,9,We know it's coming here.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,10,How can you leave us now?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,11,I did everything I could. You know that.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,12,You swore a vow.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,13,"Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,14,- I gave my life. - For all nights to come.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,15,"They killed me, Edd! My own brothers."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,16,You want me to stay here after that?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,17,<i>Riders approaching!</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,18,<i>Open the gate!</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,19,This is good soup.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,20,Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,21,- With the peas and onions? - Mmm.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,22,We never should have left Winterfell.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,23,Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,24,"I want to scream at myself, ""Don't go, you idiot."""
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,25,How could we know?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,26,I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,27,<i>I wish I could</i> <i>change everything.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,28,We were children.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,29,"I was awful, just admit it."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,30,You were occasionally awful.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,31,I'm sure I can't have been great fun.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,32,Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,33,- Can you forgive me? - There's nothing to forgive.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,34,- Forgive me. - All right.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,35,"All right, I forgive you."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,36,"You'd think after thousands of years,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,37,the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,38,Where will you go?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,39,Where will <i>we</i> go?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,40,"If I don't watch over you,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,41,Father's ghost will come back and murder me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,42,Where will we go?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,43,"I can't stay here, not after what happened."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,44,<i>There's only one place</i> <i>we can go.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,45,Home.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,46,Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,47,We'll take it back from them.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,48,I don't have an army.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,49,How many wildlings did you save?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,50,They didn't come here to serve me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,51,They owe you their lives.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,52,You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,53,- Sansa. - Winterfell is our home.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,54,It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,55,"Wherever they are, it belongs to our family."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,56,We have to fight for it.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,57,I'm tired of fighting.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,58,It's all I've done since I left home.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,59,I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,60,I've killed wildlings. I've killed men that I admire.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,61,I hanged a boy younger than Bran.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,62,I fought and I lost.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,63,"If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,64,I want you to help me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,65,But I'll do it myself if I have to.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,66,My lady.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,67,Ser Davos.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,68,Will you stay here at Castle Black?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,69,I will do as Jon Snow commands.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,70,You serve Jon Snow now?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,71,He's the prince that was promised.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,72,"Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,73,What happened down there?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,74,There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,75,And Shireen?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,76,What happened to the princess?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,77,I saw what happened.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,78,I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,79,"My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,80,We've met before.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,81,I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,82,Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,83,That's in the past now.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,84,"Yes, it's in the past."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,85,It doesn't mean I forget.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,86,Or forgive.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,87,"He admitted it, you know."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,88,Who did?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,89,Stannis.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,90,Just before I executed him.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,91,The Defender of the Vale!
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,92,Uncle Petyr!
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,93,My lord.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,94,Come and see.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,95,I missed your name day. Go on.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,96,A falcon!
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,97,A gyrfalcon.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,98,The greatest and rarest of birds.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,99,"Last time I saw you, Baelish,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,100,you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,101,Indeed I was.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,102,"And yet not long ago, we received reports"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,103,that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,104,"On our way to the Fingers,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,105,we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,106,Seemed to know exactly when
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,107,we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,108,Do you take me for a fool?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,109,"Tell me, Lord Royce,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,110,how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,111,I shared my intentions with you
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,112,<i>and no one else.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,113,"Slander a man in his own home,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,114,you might find yourself crossing swords with him.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,115,Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,116,And only his judgment concerns me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,117,<i>Shall we throw him</i> <i>through the Moon Door?</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,118,My lord.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,119,"My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,120,"To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,121,"Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,122,Lord Royce has served the Vale well.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,123,He's enjoyed a distinguished military career.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,124,"If we could trust his absolute loyalty,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,125,he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,126,"You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,127,I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,128,Fine.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,129,I bring good news.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,130,My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,131,I expect she's headed to Castle Black
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,132,where her brother serves as Lord Commander.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,133,"But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,134,She's my cousin.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,135,We should help her.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,136,That was my instinct as well.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,137,Our lord has spoken.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,138,Gather the Knights of the Vale.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,139,The time has come to join the fray.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,140,<i>You invite the enemy</i> <i>into our city?</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,141,I did.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,142,"As a clever man once told me,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,143,"""We make peace with our enemies, not our friends."""
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,144,I don't make peace with the queen's enemies.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,145,I kill the queen's enemies.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,146,"Yes, that's the military approach."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,147,And how has that worked here in Meereen?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,148,I represent the diplomatic approach.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,149,Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,150,and they tried to murder her.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,151,We enter these negotiations with open eyes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,152,Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,153,has taught me the horrors of that institution.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,154,How many days were you a slave?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,155,Long enough to know.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,156,Not long enough to understand.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,157,I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,158,And somehow you've risen
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,159,to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,160,It's most impressive.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,161,And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,162,Here's to reversals of fortune.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,163,We came here to meet the queen
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,164,and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,165,"Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,166,We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,167,Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,168,Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,169,Her path takes her westward.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,170,"When we last met, I offered her ships"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,171,so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,172,She refused them because hundreds of thousands
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,173,"of men, women, and children still lived in chains."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,174,As they have since the dawn of time.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,175,- Not anymore. - You think you're a free man now?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,176,You still follow orders.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,177,Just because your master has silver hair and tits
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,178,doesn't mean she's not a master.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,179,"Friends, friends, friends, please."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,180,There have always been
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,181,those with wealth and power and those with nothing.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,182,That is the way of the world.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,183,I'm not here to change the way of the world.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,184,Slavery is the way of our world.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,185,You don't need slaves to make money.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,186,There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,187,and I grew up richer than any of you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,188,But our queen recognizes that she erred
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,189,by abolishing slavery
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,190,without providing a new system to replace it.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,191,So here is the queen's proposal.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,192,"Slavery will never return to Meereen,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,193,but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,194,time to adjust to the new order.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,195,What does that mean?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,196,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,197,we will give you seven years to end the practice.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,198,Slaveholders will be compensated
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,199,"for their losses, of course, at fair prices."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,200,"In exchange, you will cut off"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,201,your support for the Sons of the Harpy.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,202,We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,203,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,204,"I do hope you accept, my friends."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,205,You will not receive a better offer.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,206,Let us sail on the tide of freedom
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,207,instead of being drowned by it.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,208,And as a parting gift to our honored guests...
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,209,Give freedom a chance.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,210,See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,211,Perhaps I should translate for you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,212,<i>We speak</i> <i>the Common Tongue.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,213,- Excellent. - You met with the slavers today.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,214,<i>I did.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,215,Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,216,<i>Now you invite them</i> <i>to our city and drink wine with them.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,217,I imagine this room was built
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,218,so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,219,But I am not your ruler.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,220,I'm not the Breaker of Chains.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,221,I'm not the Unburnt.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,222,And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,223,You are a stranger here.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,224,So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,225,Because our queen chose me as her advisor.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,226,Until she returns from her travels--
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,227,When does she return?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,228,Soon. You have my word.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,229,We don't know you. We don't trust you. We know Torgo Nudho.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,230,We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,231,And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,232,"<i>As commander of the Unsullied,</i> <i>he knows how to defeat the slavers</i>"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,233,and he knows when it is time to make peace.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,234,You have made peace with the slavers?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,235,<i>We offered terms.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,236,- Do not use me for your lies. - Those men respect you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,237,They respect me because they know who I am.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,238,- They know I am loyal. - As do I.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,239,"I am loyal to my queen, not you."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,240,"If you betray her work, you are my enemy."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,241,I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,242,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,243,For a short time.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,244,Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,245,You're right.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,246,Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,247,War is a horror that should be ended at once.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,248,I can't do both today.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,249,You are wrong to trust these men.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,250,I don't trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,251,They're trustworthy if they're convinced
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,252,that working with me is in their self-interest.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,253,You don't know them. You don't understand them.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,254,We are not human in their eyes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,255,They look at me and see a weapon.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,256,They look at her and see a whore.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,257,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,258,Their contempt is their weakness.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,259,They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,260,You will not use them.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,261,They will use you. That is what they do.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,262,You all right?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,263,Why don't you sit and catch your breath?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,264,I'm fine.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,265,I don't think you could ride the dragon.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,266,"20 years ago, maybe."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,267,- What? - Our queen.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,268,"She's wild, you know. Don't let her size fool you."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,269,It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,270,"You, I don't think your heart could take it."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,271,Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,272,Makes me sad. You'll disappoint her before long.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,273,- She'll move on. - We'll all disappoint her before long.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,274,We need each other right now. After we're done needing each other--
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,275,"Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,276,What do I have to gain?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,277,"If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,278,"If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,279,"You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,280,None.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,281,"The road running through the Horse Gate,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,282,they call that the godsway.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,283,"Eastern Market, Western Market."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,284,"When Khal Drogo died,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,285,"she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,286,the widows of the dead khals.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,287,"That's where they would have taken her,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,288,<i>the Temple</i> <i>of the Dosh Khaleen.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,289,What are you doing?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,290,It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,291,Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,292,"If they spot us and we're unarmed,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,293,we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,294,But if they see weapons...
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,295,You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,296,"There's 100,000 of them down there."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,297,We can't fight our way out.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,298,"We wait till dark, and then we'll find her."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,299,Uh...
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,300,I'm very attached to this knife.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,301,Don't worry. It didn't touch you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,302,You know what happens?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,303,I know what happens.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,304,I'll do it myself.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,305,I should have been born a Dothraki.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,306,Come on.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,307,"Told you, I'm very attached to this knife."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,308,You all right?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,309,"If they find a body with a stab wound,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,310,the whole city will be looking for us.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,311,Huh.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,312,Mm-hmm.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,313,"- No, don't hurt her. - She'll give us away."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,314,We have to go now.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,315,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,316,All we can do is try.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,317,No.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,318,We can do more than that.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,319,And you're going to help me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,320,"If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,321,- <i> What would you seek out?</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,322,"I'd go to my brother,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,323,"my husband, my family."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,324,"Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,325,"finery, power."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,326,Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,327,<i>I'm not maligning you.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,328,"I sought those things out, too."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,329,To the exclusion of all else.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,330,<i>My father was a cobbler.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,331,He died when I was young and I took over his shop.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,332,He was a simple man and he made simple shoes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,333,"But I found that the more work I put into my shoes,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,334,the more people wanted them.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,335,"Fine leather, ornamentation,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,336,"detailing, and time."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,337,Time most of all.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,338,Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,339,Quality takes time.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,340,Yes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,341,I imagine you've worn a year
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,342,of someone's life on your back.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,343,<i>The highborn liked to cover</i> <i>their feet with my time</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,344,and they paid well for the privilege.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,345,I used their money
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,346,to buy a taste of their lives for myself.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,347,"<i>Each time I indulged,</i>"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,348,I felt myself ascending to something better.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,349,And one day you walked through a graveyard
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,350,and realized it was all for nothing
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,351,and set out on the path to righteousness.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,352,"Book of the Stranger, verse 25."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,353,"You know ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,354,Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,355,"Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,356,You're close.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,357,But it wasn't a graveyard.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,358,It was a feast.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,359,I bought old fine wine
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,360,and young pretty girls
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,361,and invited my friends to come and share it all.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,362,"<i>We passed around the wine,</i> <i>passed around the women,</i>"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,363,<i>and soon we fell</i> <i>into a stupor.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,364,I woke before dawn.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,365,I could barely stand.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,366,"Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,367,lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,368,The truth of their bodies laid bare.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,369,I could smell them
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,370,beneath the incense and the perfume
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,371,and the fine food that had already started to turn.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,372,And I saw it with perfect clarity.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,373,I saw what my sins were.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,374,"The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,375,my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,376,It was all part of a story.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,377,A story I was telling myself about who I was.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,378,<i>A collection of lies</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,379,<i>that would disappear</i> <i>in the light.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,380,"The people I was trying to climb away from,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,381,"the beggars in the street,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,382,"<i>the poor,</i>"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,383,they were closer to the truth than I ever was.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,384,So what did you do?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,385,<i>I left to go</i> <i>and find them.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,386,I didn't even put on my shoes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,387,I walked out the door and never went back.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,388,"Come, let's go and see him."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,389,- Who? - Your brother.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,390,Loras.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,391,Loras.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,392,Listen to me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,393,You need to stay strong.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,394,I can't stay strong.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,395,I never was strong.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,396,You are strong.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,397,"You are the future of our house,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,398,the future of our family.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,399,- I don't care about that. - Shh!
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,400,Shh.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,401,Have you-- have you told them that?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,402,That you don't care?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,403,I just want it to stop.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,404,Help me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,405,They want me to help you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,406,They want me to help tear you down.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,407,They want me to help tear you down.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,408,That's why he's letting me see you. I know it is.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,409,"And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,410,Let them win.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,411,Just make it stop.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,412,Please.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,413,All right.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,414,"<i>And now, how to avert disaster</i> <i>with our current predicament.</i>"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,415,<i>This High Sparrow.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,416,"<i>I have dealt with fanatics</i> <i>of every description, Your Grace.</i>"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,417,"Not setting them off, that's the most important thing."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,418,You are beset with enemies both within and without.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,419,What are you doing here?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,420,I am advising the king on our current predicament.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,421,Leave.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,422,I am a member of the small council.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,423,The king--
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,424,Is this a small council meeting?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,425,Obviously not.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,426,I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,427,"Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,428,That will be all for now.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,429,Your Grace.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,430,"Since I've missed the past several small council meetings,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,431,I wanted to speak to you about a few things.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,432,I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,433,"As have we all, unfortunately."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,434,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,435,To prevent things from escalating any further.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,436,We have to be careful not to antagonize him.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,437,He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,438,- He's dangerous. - Look at me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,439,What did they do to me?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,440,To the king's own mother?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,441,It's all right.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,442,It's done. It's in the past.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,443,And of course
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,444,Margaery's safety is paramount.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,445,"You don't like Margaery, do you?"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,446,Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,447,Margaery is the queen.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,448,Queens must command respect. Kings even more so.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,449,"Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,450,The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,451,No respect for anything in this world.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,452,He has no use for the things of this world.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,453,He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,454,With fantasies.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,455,<i>With beggars</i> <i>in the street.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,456,With nothing.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,457,Mother...
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,458,there's something I want to tell you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,459,Something the High Sparrow told me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,460,You've spoken with him?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,461,I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told--
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,462,It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,463,given his constant prattling about the truth.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,464,I am your mother.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,465,You can always trust me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,466,The small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,467,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,468,<i>You're not welcome.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,469,<i>You once spoke of your</i> <i>respect for our father</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,470,because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,471,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,472,"publically shamed, and confined to the Red Keep."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,473,What's left to work with?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,474,<i>Cersei is the mother</i> <i>of the king.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,475,She has the king's ear and his trust.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,476,And the king has been speaking regularly
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,477,with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,478,The High Sparrow seized power
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,479,knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,480,instead of seizing it back.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,481,Here we are. Well done to us.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,482,Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,483,rests in his dirty peasant hands.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,484,"In a few days, he'll have a trial for me."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,485,"But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,486,"Yes, Margaery will repent her sins"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,487,before the good people of the city.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,488,"Oh, no."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,489,That cannot happen.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,490,That will not happen.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,491,I agree.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,492,You've got the second largest army in Westeros.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,493,"You'll bring them into the city,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,494,"stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,495,and take her back into Crown custody.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,496,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,497,or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,498,You will take no action at all.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,499,"When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,500,<i>Are you expressly</i> <i>forbidden from standing down?</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,501,"No, but if the king should call--"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,502,The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,503,"When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,504,"and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,505,do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,506,You hate these fanatics as much as we do.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,507,You hate what they've done to your son.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,508,Do you want Lancel back?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,509,Or have you given him up for good?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,510,Of course I want him back.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,511,Then stand aside
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,512,and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,513,"If it doesn't go as planned,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,514,the sparrows have many friends in this city.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,515,We'll have civil war. Many will die.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,516,Many will die no matter what we do.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,517,Better them than us.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,518,They told me you were home and I didn't believe it.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,519,"""Theon Greyjoy?"" I said."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,520,"""He's dead."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,521,"He's been dead a long time."""
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,522,He let you go?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,523,I escaped.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,524,I can't hear you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,525,I escaped.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,526,Look at me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,527,Look at me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,528,Men died trying to rescue you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,529,Good men.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,530,My men.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,531,I'm sorry.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,532,You were my brother.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,533,"You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,534,and I risked everything for you
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,535,and you betrayed me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,536,I know. I know and I'm sorry.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,537,Stop saying that.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,538,He broke me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,539,"He broke me into 1,000 pieces."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,540,- I know. - You don't know.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,541,He sent us one of those pieces.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,542,That's why I came for you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,543,Why did you come here?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,544,Where else could I go?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,545,You heard Father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,546,"No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,547,You happen to show up on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,548,I didn't know.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,549,You think any ironborn wants you to be king
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,550,after what you've done?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,551,I don't want to be king.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,552,What do you want?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,553,I should have listened to you. You're the only one--
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,554,That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,555,Look at me.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,556,Tell me what you want.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,557,You should rule the Iron Islands.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,558,Let me help you.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,559,They've cleaned you up nicely.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,560,You know who I am?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,561,A lord.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,562,Yes.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,563,A lord.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,564,You've seen my banners?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,565,The flayed man.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,566,Does that worry you at all?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,567,You eat them after?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,568,No.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,569,Then I've seen worse.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,570,You served the Starks?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,571,Aye. They put me in chains
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,572,"and put a sword at my throat,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,573,so I served them.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,574,"The Starks have been gone for a long time,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,575,but you kept protecting Rickon.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,576,He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,577,I served his family a long time.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,578,Didn't get no wages.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,579,"Way I see it, I'm owed."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,580,"Be that as it may,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,581,Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,582,He's mine.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,583,So what use could I possibly have for you?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,584,I can give you what you want.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,585,And you're sure you know what that is?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,586,Same thing men always want.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,587,"And when they really want it, they give it a bath first."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,588,You're a good talker.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,589,I like that.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,590,You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,591,That so?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,592,I had to work hard to get him talking.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,593,But he talked.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,594,They all do.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,595,He told me everything.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,596,"All about the Stark boys,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,597,"who helped them escape,"

S06E04,Book of the Stranger,599,<i>Open the gate!</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,600,Sorry about the food.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,601,It's not what we're known for.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,602,That's all right. There are more important things.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,603,"A letter for you, Lord Commander."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,604,I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,605,"""To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,606,You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,607,You have betrayed your own kind.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,608,You have betrayed the North.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,609,"Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,610,Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,611,His direwolf's skin is on my floor.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,612,Come and see. I want my bride back.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,613,"Send her to me, bastard,"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,614,and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,615,Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,616,"every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,617,You will watch as I skin them living.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,618,"You--"""
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,619,Go on.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,620,It's just more of the same.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,621,"""You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,622,<i>You will watch</i> <i>as my dogs</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,623,devour your wild little brother.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,624,Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,625,"Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,626,"and Warden of the North."""
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,627,Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,628,His father's dead.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,629,Ramsay killed him.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,630,- <i>And now he has Rickon.</i> <i>- We don't know that.</i>
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,631,"Yes, we do."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,632,How many men does he have in his army?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,633,"I heard him say 5,000"
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,634,once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,635,How many do you have?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,636,That can march and fight?
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,637,"2,000."
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,638,The rest are children and old people.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,639,You're the son of the last true Warden of the North.
S06E04,Book of the Stranger,640,Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.

S06E05,The Door,4,"For you, my lady."
S06E05,The Door,5,How far is Mole's Town?
S06E05,The Door,6,Sansa.
S06E05,The Door,7,Lady Brienne.
S06E05,The Door,8,"When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst."
S06E05,The Door,9,You have no idea how happy I am
S06E05,The Door,10,to see you unharmed.
S06E05,The Door,11,Unharmed?
S06E05,The Door,12,What are you doing here?
S06E05,The Door,13,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid.
S06E05,The Door,14,<i>They're encamped</i> <i>at Moat Cailin as we speak.</i>
S06E05,The Door,15,To come to my aid?
S06E05,The Door,16,Did you know about Ramsay?
S06E05,The Door,17,"If you didn't know, you're an idiot."
S06E05,The Door,18,"If you did know, you're my enemy."
S06E05,The Door,19,Would you like to hear about our wedding night?
S06E05,The Door,20,He never hurt my face.
S06E05,The Door,21,"He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter."
S06E05,The Door,22,"But the rest of me,"
S06E05,The Door,23,he did what he liked with the rest of me
S06E05,The Door,24,<i>as long as I could</i> <i>still give him an heir.</i>

S06E05,The Door,26,I can't begin to contemplate--

S06E05,The Door,28,Lady Sansa asked you a question.
S06E05,The Door,29,He beat you.
S06E05,The Door,30,"Yes, he enjoyed that."
S06E05,The Door,31,What else do you think he did?
S06E05,The Door,32,"- Sansa, I-- - What else?"
S06E05,The Door,33,Did he cut you?
S06E05,The Door,34,Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
S06E05,The Door,35,I didn't know.
S06E05,The Door,36,I thought you knew everyone's secrets.
S06E05,The Door,37,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake."
S06E05,The Door,38,I underestimated a stranger.
S06E05,The Door,39,"The other things he did,"
S06E05,The Door,40,"ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things,"
S06E05,The Door,41,but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.
S06E05,The Door,42,I can still feel it.
S06E05,The Door,43,I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.
S06E05,The Door,44,I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.
S06E05,The Door,45,I'm so sorry.
S06E05,The Door,46,You said you would protect me.
S06E05,The Door,47,And I will.
S06E05,The Door,48,You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
S06E05,The Door,49,I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore.
S06E05,The Door,50,You can't protect me.
S06E05,The Door,51,You won't even be able to protect yourself
S06E05,The Door,52,if I tell Brienne to cut you down.
S06E05,The Door,53,And why shouldn't I?
S06E05,The Door,54,Do you want me to beg for my life?
S06E05,The Door,55,"If that's what you want, I will."
S06E05,The Door,56,"Whatever you ask that is in my power,"
S06E05,The Door,57,I will do.
S06E05,The Door,58,What if I want you to die here and now?
S06E05,The Door,59,Then I will die.
S06E05,The Door,60,You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family
S06E05,The Door,61,and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family.
S06E05,The Door,62,<i>Go back to Moat Cailin.</i>
S06E05,The Door,63,My brother and I will take back the North on our own.
S06E05,The Door,64,I never want to see you again.
S06E05,The Door,65,I would do anything to undo what's been done to you.
S06E05,The Door,66,I know that I can't.
S06E05,The Door,67,Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go?
S06E05,The Door,68,<i>Your great-uncle</i> <i>Brynden the Blackfish</i>
S06E05,The Door,69,has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.
S06E05,The Door,70,You might consider seeking him out.
S06E05,The Door,71,The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
S06E05,The Door,72,I have an army.
S06E05,The Door,73,Your brother's army.
S06E05,The Door,74,Half-brother.
S06E05,The Door,75,You're not ready.
S06E05,The Door,76,You should go home before it's too late.
S06E05,The Door,77,"You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark."
S06E05,The Door,78,She has a point.
S06E05,The Door,79,None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies.
S06E05,The Door,80,They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
S06E05,The Door,81,Who was the first?
S06E05,The Door,82,He was no one.
S06E05,The Door,83,The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face
S06E05,The Door,84,and how to give the gift.
S06E05,The Door,85,The man taught others in exchange for their service.
S06E05,The Door,86,"Many served, many more gifts were given."
S06E05,The Door,87,Soon all the masters and overseers were gone
S06E05,The Door,88,and the Faceless Men fled.
S06E05,The Door,89,Where did they go?
S06E05,The Door,90,Here.
S06E05,The Door,91,They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house.
S06E05,The Door,92,These were the faces they wore in life
S06E05,The Door,93,when they were not wearing others.
S06E05,The Door,94,The first Faceless Men.
S06E05,The Door,95,"And now a girl is one of them,"
S06E05,The Door,96,if a girl desires.
S06E05,The Door,97,A girl has no desires.
S06E05,The Door,98,Who?
S06E05,The Door,99,<i>An actress who calls</i> <i>herself Lady Crane.</i>
S06E05,The Door,100,She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.
S06E05,The Door,101,<i>A girl has been given</i> <i>a second chance.</i>
S06E05,The Door,102,There will not be a third.
S06E05,The Door,103,"One way or another,"
S06E05,The Door,104,a face will be added to the hall.
S06E05,The Door,105,Ahh!
S06E05,The Door,106,"Oh, murdered by a boar."
S06E05,The Door,107,The great big hairy whore.
S06E05,The Door,108,He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts
S06E05,The Door,109,and soon I am no more.
S06E05,The Door,110,"Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie."
S06E05,The Door,111,"I love you, Father. Please don't die."
S06E05,The Door,112,"Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine."
S06E05,The Door,113,I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land.
S06E05,The Door,114,"And our son alone on that cold, cold throne"
S06E05,The Door,115,without a guiding hand.
S06E05,The Door,116,Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace?
S06E05,The Door,117,To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?
S06E05,The Door,118,Ned Stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
S06E05,The Door,119,Ooh!
S06E05,The Door,120,"Ooh, what's happened here, then?"
S06E05,The Door,121,"He brought you here, Ned Stark,"
S06E05,The Door,122,'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.
S06E05,The Door,123,You should be king of us all
S06E05,The Door,124,and I should be your Hand.
S06E05,The Door,125,We men of the North are right good hands
S06E05,The Door,126,at keeping people lawful.
S06E05,The Door,127,"I'd ask him for permission,"
S06E05,The Door,128,but he smells too bloody awful.
S06E05,The Door,129,<i>I die! I die!</i>
S06E05,The Door,130,And here I now must lie.
S06E05,The Door,131,"Oh, woe. Oh, no."
S06E05,The Door,132,"Oh, I am about to go."
S06E05,The Door,133,Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
S06E05,The Door,134,The Iron Throne's what I demand.
S06E05,The Door,135,- You cannot. - I can.
S06E05,The Door,136,- You will not. - I will.
S06E05,The Door,137,- You dare not. - I dare yes.
S06E05,The Door,138,- <i>The line of succession.</i> - <i>What's that mean?</i>
S06E05,The Door,139,- <i>The proper progression.</i> - <i>What's that mean?</i>
S06E05,The Door,140,- The lawful ascension. - What's that mean?
S06E05,The Door,141,"So move along, give me my chair"
S06E05,The Door,142,and there won't be no more trouble.
S06E05,The Door,143,But we had a deal all done and dusted.
S06E05,The Door,144,I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
S06E05,The Door,145,Save my father.
S06E05,The Door,146,Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
S06E05,The Door,147,"- Save him, please. - Show him mercy."
S06E05,The Door,148,<i>Show the people what</i> <i>a good king should be.</i>
S06E05,The Door,149,"Good people, you may all relax."
S06E05,The Door,150,My father's friend shall be spared the--
S06E05,The Door,151,<i>Father! No!</i>
S06E05,The Door,152,"Oh, Father. Oh!"
S06E05,The Door,153,<i>Worry not!</i>
S06E05,The Door,154,<i>All is well.</i>
S06E05,The Door,155,I have here a decree
S06E05,The Door,156,"from my father Tywin Lannister,"
S06E05,The Door,157,the richest man you'll see.
S06E05,The Door,158,He proclaims me Hand of the King.
S06E05,The Door,159,The position's mine for life.
S06E05,The Door,160,And he's given me permission to take
S06E05,The Door,161,Sansa as my wife.
S06E05,The Door,162,"You'll learn that what I lack in height,"
S06E05,The Door,163,I make up for in appetite.
S06E05,The Door,164,"<i>So let's forget</i> <i>about your plight,</i>"
S06E05,The Door,165,and go rehearse our wedding night.
S06E05,The Door,166,It's a wart. Two warts.
S06E05,The Door,167,I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
S06E05,The Door,168,"Well, don't worry, love."
S06E05,The Door,169,They usually go away in five or six years.
S06E05,The Door,170,"Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
S06E05,The Door,171,"You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
S06E05,The Door,172,I had two lines.
S06E05,The Door,173,There are no small parts. You rang very false.
S06E05,The Door,174,I rang very false?
S06E05,The Door,175,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
S06E05,The Door,176,You weren't complaining about me last night.
S06E05,The Door,177,"<i>May I get you some wine,</i> <i>Lady Crane?</i>"
S06E05,The Door,178,"<i>I'm a rum girl, Bobono.</i>"
S06E05,The Door,179,You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.
S06E05,The Door,180,Of course we're going to be intimate.
S06E05,The Door,181,It's only a matter of time.
S06E05,The Door,182,To our children.
S06E05,The Door,183,May they have your talent.
S06E05,The Door,184,And your filthy mind.
S06E05,The Door,185,A girl will poison the rum.
S06E05,The Door,186,Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
S06E05,The Door,187,If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall...
S06E05,The Door,188,A girl is not ready.
S06E05,The Door,189,She's a good actress.
S06E05,The Door,190,So a man has heard.
S06E05,The Door,191,Seems like a decent woman.
S06E05,The Door,192,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
S06E05,The Door,193,No.
S06E05,The Door,194,Who wants her dead?
S06E05,The Door,195,That does not matter. The price was paid.
S06E05,The Door,196,The younger actress.
S06E05,The Door,197,She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
S06E05,The Door,198,A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
S06E05,The Door,199,A girl has decided.
S06E05,The Door,200,A servant does not ask questions.
S06E05,The Door,201,No! No! No!
S06E05,The Door,202,It was you.
S06E05,The Door,203,You made the white walkers.
S06E05,The Door,204,We were at war.
S06E05,The Door,205,<i>We were being</i> <i>slaughtered.</i>
S06E05,The Door,206,<i>Our sacred trees</i> <i>cut down.</i>
S06E05,The Door,207,We needed to defend ourselves.
S06E05,The Door,208,From whom?
S06E05,The Door,209,From you.
S06E05,The Door,210,From men.
S06E05,The Door,211,We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.
S06E05,The Door,212,In his name we gather today
S06E05,The Door,213,to choose a new king as our leader.
S06E05,The Door,214,Who makes a claim?
S06E05,The Door,215,"I am Yara Greyjoy,"
S06E05,The Door,216,"daughter of Balon Greyjoy,"
S06E05,The Door,217,King of the Iron Islands.
S06E05,The Door,218,I claim the Salt Throne.
S06E05,The Door,219,We've never had a queen. Not once.
S06E05,The Door,220,There are many things we've never done.
S06E05,The Door,221,We've never made our mark upon the world.
S06E05,The Door,222,The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind
S06E05,The Door,223,until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms
S06E05,The Door,224,<i>long enough</i> <i>to become a nuisance.</i>
S06E05,The Door,225,Then they swat us down.
S06E05,The Door,226,"They conquer us, humiliate us,"
S06E05,The Door,227,<i>and go right back</i> <i>to forgetting we exist.</i>
S06E05,The Door,228,Aye!
S06E05,The Door,229,- We are a sea people. - Aye!
S06E05,The Door,230,- Our god is a sea god. - Aye!
S06E05,The Door,231,"When I am queen, we will build a fleet that--"
S06E05,The Door,232,- You shall not be queen! - I am not finished!
S06E05,The Door,233,"Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us."
S06E05,The Door,234,Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.
S06E05,The Door,235,I am Theon Greyjoy...
S06E05,The Door,236,last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
S06E05,The Door,237,And she is your rightful ruler.
S06E05,The Door,238,Aye!
S06E05,The Door,239,"Those of you that have sailed under her,"
S06E05,The Door,240,"and there are many of you here,"
S06E05,The Door,241,- <i>you know what she is.</i> - Aye!
S06E05,The Door,242,- She is a reaver. - Aye!
S06E05,The Door,243,- She is a warrior. - Aye!
S06E05,The Door,244,She is ironborn!
S06E05,The Door,245,Aye!
S06E05,The Door,246,We will find no better leader.
S06E05,The Door,247,This is our queen.
S06E05,The Door,248,<i>Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>
S06E05,The Door,249,I'm Euron Greyjoy.
S06E05,The Door,250,I claim the Salt Throne.
S06E05,The Door,251,Niece.
S06E05,The Door,252,Nephew.
S06E05,The Door,253,Little Theon.
S06E05,The Door,254,Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground.
S06E05,The Door,255,<i>Captured a castle</i> <i>you couldn't keep.</i>
S06E05,The Door,256,Got yourself taken prisoner.
S06E05,The Door,257,Even heard you have no cock.
S06E05,The Door,258,Explains why you think a woman can be king.
S06E05,The Door,259,"When did you return, Uncle?"
S06E05,The Door,260,A few days ago.
S06E05,The Door,261,I had some things to take care of.
S06E05,The Door,262,Long overdue.
S06E05,The Door,263,I'm glad you're here.
S06E05,The Door,264,Now I know what my first act as queen will be.
S06E05,The Door,265,To execute the man who killed my father.
S06E05,The Door,266,I did.
S06E05,The Door,267,I killed him.
S06E05,The Door,268,Threw him right over a rope bridge
S06E05,The Door,269,and watched him fall.
S06E05,The Door,270,<i>He was leading us</i> <i>nowhere</i>
S06E05,The Door,271,and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.
S06E05,The Door,272,<i>No one loved him.</i> <i>No one wanted to follow him.</i>
S06E05,The Door,273,He led us into two wars we couldn't win.
S06E05,The Door,274,I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
S06E05,The Door,275,That would have been hard to do.
S06E05,The Door,276,You weren't here.
S06E05,The Door,277,"Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
S06E05,The Door,278,Gallivanting?
S06E05,The Door,279,That the sort of thing you start to say
S06E05,The Door,280,once your dick gets chopped off?
S06E05,The Door,281,<i>Did the great lords</i> <i>of Westeros teach you words like that?</i>
S06E05,The Door,282,You were gone.
S06E05,The Door,283,Yara was here.
S06E05,The Door,284,<i>Being ironborn.</i> <i>Leading ironborn.</i>
S06E05,The Door,285,<i>Getting ready to bring us</i> <i>back to glory.</i>
S06E05,The Door,286,<i>And how will she do that?</i>
S06E05,The Door,287,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
S06E05,The Door,288,"Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet"
S06E05,The Door,289,<i>because I'm the one</i> <i>who knows how to use it.</i>
S06E05,The Door,290,<i>I've been</i> <i>all over the world.</i>
S06E05,The Door,291,I've seen more of it than all of you combined.
S06E05,The Door,292,And across the sea there is a person
S06E05,The Door,293,who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.
S06E05,The Door,294,"Someone with a large army,"
S06E05,The Door,295,"three large dragons, and no husband."
S06E05,The Door,296,<i>I'm going to build</i> <i>that fleet</i>
S06E05,The Door,297,and I'm going to gallivant right over
S06E05,The Door,298,and give it to Daenerys Targaryen
S06E05,The Door,299,along with my big cock.
S06E05,The Door,300,You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
S06E05,The Door,301,I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her.
S06E05,The Door,302,And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.
S06E05,The Door,303,I wasn't born to be king.
S06E05,The Door,304,I paid the iron price
S06E05,The Door,305,and here I stand.
S06E05,The Door,306,Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!
S06E05,The Door,307,Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!
S06E05,The Door,308,Euron! Euron!
S06E05,The Door,309,"May Euron, your servant, be born again"
S06E05,The Door,310,from the sea as you were.
S06E05,The Door,311,<i>Bless him with salt.</i> <i>Bless him with stone.</i>
S06E05,The Door,312,<i>Bless him with steel.</i>
S06E05,The Door,313,<i>Listen to the waves.</i> <i>Listen to the god.</i>
S06E05,The Door,314,<i>He is speaking to us</i> <i>and he says</i>
S06E05,The Door,315,<i>we shall have no king</i> <i>but Euron Greyjoy.</i>
S06E05,The Door,316,Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away.
S06E05,The Door,317,<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>
S06E05,The Door,318,<i>Let his lungs</i> <i>fill with seawater.</i>
S06E05,The Door,319,<i>Let the fish eat</i> <i>the scales off his eyes.</i>
S06E05,The Door,320,"<i>What is dead</i> <i>may never die,</i>"
S06E05,The Door,321,but rises again harder and stronger.
S06E05,The Door,322,What is dead may never die.
S06E05,The Door,323,What is dead may never die.
S06E05,The Door,324,Where are my niece and nephew?
S06E05,The Door,325,Let's go murder them.
S06E05,The Door,326,<i>They stole our best ships.</i>
S06E05,The Door,327,Won't be enough to save them.
S06E05,The Door,328,Go back to your homes.
S06E05,The Door,329,Chop down every tree you can find.
S06E05,The Door,330,Quarter-saw the timber and start building.
S06E05,The Door,331,I want every man bending planks.
S06E05,The Door,332,I want every woman spinning flax for sails.
S06E05,The Door,333,Build me a thousand ships
S06E05,The Door,334,and I will give you this world.
S06E05,The Door,335,I banished you twice.
S06E05,The Door,336,You came back twice.
S06E05,The Door,337,And you saved my life.
S06E05,The Door,338,So I can't take you back
S06E05,The Door,339,and I can't send you away.
S06E05,The Door,340,You must send me away.
S06E05,The Door,341,Is there a cure?
S06E05,The Door,342,I don't know.
S06E05,The Door,343,How long does it take?
S06E05,The Door,344,I don't know that either.
S06E05,The Door,345,But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.
S06E05,The Door,346,I'll end things before that.
S06E05,The Door,347,I'm sorry.
S06E05,The Door,348,I'm so sorry.
S06E05,The Door,349,Don't be.
S06E05,The Door,350,All I've ever wanted was to serve you.
S06E05,The Door,351,Tyrion Lannister was right.
S06E05,The Door,352,I love you.
S06E05,The Door,353,I'll always love you.
S06E05,The Door,354,"Good-bye, khaleesi."
S06E05,The Door,355,"Do not walk away from your queen,"
S06E05,The Door,356,Jorah the Andal.
S06E05,The Door,357,You have not been dismissed.
S06E05,The Door,358,You pledged yourself to me.
S06E05,The Door,359,You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
S06E05,The Door,360,"<i>Well, I command you</i> <i>to find the cure</i>"
S06E05,The Door,361,<i>wherever it is</i> <i>in this world.</i>
S06E05,The Door,362,I command you to heal yourself
S06E05,The Door,363,<i>and then return to me.</i>
S06E05,The Door,364,"When I take the Seven Kingdoms,"
S06E05,The Door,365,I need you by my side.
S06E05,The Door,366,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters,"
S06E05,The Door,367,how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?
S06E05,The Door,368,None.
S06E05,The Door,369,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?
S06E05,The Door,370,"Two, but that was the day of the pact."
S06E05,The Door,371,"<i>Since then, nothing.</i>"
S06E05,The Door,372,So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
S06E05,The Door,373,For now.
S06E05,The Door,374,For now is the best we get in our profession.
S06E05,The Door,375,It's not enough.
S06E05,The Door,376,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war,"
S06E05,The Door,377,I'd say it's a good start.
S06E05,The Door,378,It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.
S06E05,The Door,379,They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.
S06E05,The Door,380,The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.
S06E05,The Door,381,Resist the foreign invaders.
S06E05,The Door,382,Our queen has an even better story.
S06E05,The Door,383,"Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that."
S06E05,The Door,384,The people know who brought them freedom.
S06E05,The Door,385,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security?"
S06E05,The Door,386,Who brought about an end to the violence?
S06E05,The Door,387,"We need someone the people trust,"
S06E05,The Door,388,someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.
S06E05,The Door,389,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
S06E05,The Door,390,"Who said anything about ""him""?"
S06E05,The Door,391,That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
S06E05,The Door,392,Thank you for travelling all this way.
S06E05,The Door,393,I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
S06E05,The Door,394,The truth is we need your help.
S06E05,The Door,395,We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to--
S06E05,The Door,396,You don't need to persuade me.
S06E05,The Door,397,I came to help.
S06E05,The Door,398,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised.
S06E05,The Door,399,From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
S06E05,The Door,400,Yes.
S06E05,The Door,401,She has freed the slaves from their chains
S06E05,The Door,402,and crucified the Masters for their sins.
S06E05,The Door,403,She did indeed.
S06E05,The Door,404,"Her dragons are fire made flesh,"
S06E05,The Door,405,a gift from the Lord of Light.
S06E05,The Door,406,"But you heard all of this before, haven't you?"
S06E05,The Door,407,On the Long Bridge of Volantis.
S06E05,The Door,408,"<i>The dragons will</i> <i>purify nonbelievers by the thousands,</i>"
S06E05,The Door,409,burning their sins and flesh away.
S06E05,The Door,410,Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers.
S06E05,The Door,411,The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
S06E05,The Door,412,You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.
S06E05,The Door,413,"And while she's gone, you want her advisors"
S06E05,The Door,414,to be worshipped and obeyed.
S06E05,The Door,415,I'd settle for obeyed.
S06E05,The Door,416,<i>I will summon</i> <i>my most eloquent priests.</i>
S06E05,The Door,417,They will spread the word.
S06E05,The Door,418,Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness
S06E05,The Door,419,in this war and in the great war still to come.
S06E05,The Door,420,That sounds most excellent.
S06E05,The Door,421,A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed
S06E05,The Door,422,as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.
S06E05,The Door,423,"He, too, had a glorious destiny."
S06E05,The Door,424,He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated
S06E05,The Door,425,by the man standing beside me.
S06E05,The Door,426,"Last I had heard, he had been defeated again,"
S06E05,The Door,427,this time at Winterfell and this time for good.
S06E05,The Door,428,We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
S06E05,The Door,429,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake.
S06E05,The Door,430,Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?
S06E05,The Door,431,You're always right.
S06E05,The Door,432,Everything is the Lord's will.
S06E05,The Door,433,Everything is the Lord's will.
S06E05,The Door,434,But men and women make mistakes.
S06E05,The Door,435,Even honest servants of the Lord.
S06E05,The Door,436,"And you, an honest servant of the Lord,"
S06E05,The Door,437,why should I trust you to know any more
S06E05,The Door,438,than the priestess who counseled Stannis?
S06E05,The Door,439,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,"
S06E05,The Door,440,but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.
S06E05,The Door,441,Everyone is what they are
S06E05,The Door,442,and where they are for a reason.
S06E05,The Door,443,Terrible things happen for a reason.
S06E05,The Door,444,"Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child."
S06E05,The Door,445,<i>If not for your mutilation</i>
S06E05,The Door,446,"<i>at the hand of</i> <i>a second-rate sorcerer,</i>"
S06E05,The Door,447,<i>you wouldn't be here</i> <i>helping the Lord's Chosen</i>
S06E05,The Door,448,<i>bring his light</i> <i>into the world.</i>
S06E05,The Door,449,Knowledge has made you powerful.
S06E05,The Door,450,But there's still so much you don't know.
S06E05,The Door,451,<i>Do you remember</i> <i>what you heard that night</i>
S06E05,The Door,452,<i>when the sorcerer tossed</i> <i>your parts in the fire?</i>
S06E05,The Door,453,You heard a voice call out from the flames.
S06E05,The Door,454,Do you remember?
S06E05,The Door,455,Should I tell you what the voice said?
S06E05,The Door,456,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
S06E05,The Door,457,We serve the same queen.
S06E05,The Door,458,"If you are her true friend,"
S06E05,The Door,459,you have nothing to fear from me.
S06E05,The Door,460,What?
S06E05,The Door,461,"He saw me, the Night King!"
S06E05,The Door,462,- <i>He saw me!</i> - He touched you.
S06E05,The Door,463,"I don't know. He was close, but--"
S06E05,The Door,464,He touched you.
S06E05,The Door,465,He knows you are here. He'll come for you.
S06E05,The Door,466,But he can't get in.
S06E05,The Door,467,He can now. His mark is on you.
S06E05,The Door,468,"You must leave, all of you."
S06E05,The Door,469,"<i>Come on, Hodor.</i> <i>Help me with the sledge.</i>"
S06E05,The Door,470,Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,471,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
S06E05,The Door,472,- The time has come. - The time for what?
S06E05,The Door,473,For you to become me.
S06E05,The Door,474,But am I ready?
S06E05,The Door,475,No.
S06E05,The Door,476,We can't defend the north from the walkers
S06E05,The Door,477,and the south from the Boltons.
S06E05,The Door,478,"If we want to survive, we need Winterfell"
S06E05,The Door,479,"and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
S06E05,The Door,480,"<i>Aside from the Starks</i> <i>and the Boltons,</i>"
S06E05,The Door,481,the most powerful houses in the North
S06E05,The Door,482,"are the Umbers, the Karstarks,"
S06E05,The Door,483,and the Manderlys.
S06E05,The Door,484,The Umbers and the Karstarks
S06E05,The Door,485,"have already declared for the Boltons,"
S06E05,The Door,486,so we're not doing so well there.
S06E05,The Door,487,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang.
S06E05,The Door,488,But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
S06E05,The Door,489,without knowing they had another choice.
S06E05,The Door,490,"I beg your pardon, my lady,"
S06E05,The Door,491,but they know that a Stark beheaded their father.
S06E05,The Door,492,I don't think we can count on them either.
S06E05,The Door,493,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
S06E05,The Door,494,"Precious little, my lady."
S06E05,The Door,495,<i>My father always said</i> <i>Northerners are different.</i>
S06E05,The Door,496,"More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
S06E05,The Door,497,"They may well be loyal,"
S06E05,The Door,498,but how many rose up against the Boltons
S06E05,The Door,499,when they betrayed your family?
S06E05,The Door,500,"I may not know the North, but I know men."
S06E05,The Door,501,They're more or less the same in any corner of the world
S06E05,The Door,502,and even the bravest of them don't want to see
S06E05,The Door,503,their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.
S06E05,The Door,504,"If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him,"
S06E05,The Door,505,they need to believe it's a fight they can win.
S06E05,The Door,506,There are more than three other houses in the North--
S06E05,The Door,507,"Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,"
S06E05,The Door,508,"<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>"
S06E05,The Door,509,Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others.
S06E05,The Door,510,We can start small and build.
S06E05,The Door,511,<i>The North remembers.</i>
S06E05,The Door,512,<i>They remember</i> <i>the Stark name.</i>
S06E05,The Door,513,"People will still risk everything for it,"
S06E05,The Door,514,from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.
S06E05,The Door,515,I don't doubt it.
S06E05,The Door,516,But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
S06E05,The Door,517,"No, but I do."
S06E05,The Door,518,Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son
S06E05,The Door,519,as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.
S06E05,The Door,520,"<i>And there are also the Tullys.</i> <i>They're not Northern,</i>"
S06E05,The Door,521,<i>but they will back us against</i> <i>the Boltons without question.</i>
S06E05,The Door,522,I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
S06E05,The Door,523,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it
S06E05,The Door,524,and retaken Riverrun.
S06E05,The Door,525,How do you know that?
S06E05,The Door,526,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
S06E05,The Door,527,That's good.
S06E05,The Door,528,The Blackfish is a legend.
S06E05,The Door,529,His support would mean a great deal.
S06E05,The Door,530,"Stark, Tully, a few more houses,"
S06E05,The Door,531,almost starts to look like a winning side.
S06E05,The Door,532,"I've sworn to protect you, my lady."
S06E05,The Door,533,You heard them. We need more men
S06E05,The Door,534,and my uncle has an army.
S06E05,The Door,535,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
S06E05,The Door,536,Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
S06E05,The Door,537,It has to be you.
S06E05,The Door,538,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you
S06E05,The Door,539,and you'll know how to talk to him.
S06E05,The Door,540,What is it?
S06E05,The Door,541,I don't like leaving you here alone.
S06E05,The Door,542,With Jon?
S06E05,The Door,543,Not him. He seems trustworthy.
S06E05,The Door,544,"A bit brooding, perhaps."
S06E05,The Door,545,"I suppose that's understandable, considering."
S06E05,The Door,546,"The others, though."
S06E05,The Door,547,Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother
S06E05,The Door,548,with bloodmagic.
S06E05,The Door,549,"<i>And when Stannis paid for his crime,</i> <i>where were they?</i>"
S06E05,The Door,550,Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.
S06E05,The Door,551,And that wildling fellow with the beard--
S06E05,The Door,552,"Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman"
S06E05,The Door,553,or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.
S06E05,The Door,554,He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.
S06E05,The Door,555,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
S06E05,The Door,556,New dress?
S06E05,The Door,557,I made it myself. Do you like it?
S06E05,The Door,558,"Yeah, it's-- I like the wolf bit."
S06E05,The Door,559,"Good, because I made this for you."
S06E05,The Door,560,<i>I made it like the one</i> <i>Father used to wear.</i>
S06E05,The Door,561,As near as I can remember.
S06E05,The Door,562,"Thank you, Sansa."
S06E05,The Door,563,You're welcome.
S06E05,The Door,564,Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
S06E05,The Door,565,I'll do my best.
S06E05,The Door,566,Good luck.
S06E05,The Door,567,"Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
S06E05,The Door,568,I'm not the Lord Comman--
S06E05,The Door,569,"yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate."
S06E05,The Door,570,"<i>We can go home now, Hodor.</i>"
S06E05,The Door,571,"Well, maybe not home home,"
S06E05,The Door,572,but somewhere that isn't a cave.
S06E05,The Door,573,Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,574,Eat something that isn't moss.
S06E05,The Door,575,I want an egg. How do you like 'em?
S06E05,The Door,576,Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
S06E05,The Door,577,Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,578,With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
S06E05,The Door,579,Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,580,Get Bran and run!
S06E05,The Door,581,"Bran. Bran, wake up."
S06E05,The Door,582,- Bran. - Hodor. Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,583,"Bran, wake up."
S06E05,The Door,584,<i>- Gods keep you on the kingsroad.</i> <i>- Take it easy.</i>
S06E05,The Door,585,<i>Watch yourself.</i>
S06E05,The Door,586,Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,587,Hodor. Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,588,Help me!
S06E05,The Door,589,<i>Go!</i>
S06E05,The Door,590,Go!
S06E05,The Door,591,<i>Remember that</i> <i>you are a Stark.</i>
S06E05,The Door,592,Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale
S06E05,The Door,593,<i>and try to stay</i> <i>out of fights.</i>
S06E05,The Door,594,"Yes, Father."
S06E05,The Door,595,"But if you have to fight, win."
S06E05,The Door,596,"Bran! Bran, wake up!"
S06E05,The Door,597,"Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up."
S06E05,The Door,598,"- Bran! Bran, wake up! - Hodor. Hodor."
S06E05,The Door,599,You have to wake up.
S06E05,The Door,600,- We need Hodor. - Hodor. Hodor.
S06E05,The Door,601,"<i>Bran, we need Hodor.</i>"

S06E05,The Door,605,"<i>Bran, wake up!</i>"
S06E05,The Door,606,<i>We're all going to die!</i> <i>Bran! Bran!</i>

S06E06,Blood of My Blood,5,Burn them all!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,6,Please.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,7,Burn them. Burn them all!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,8,<i>- Burn them all!</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,9,Meera.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,10,They found us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,11,I'm so sorry.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,12,"Come with me, now."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,13,The dead don't rest.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,14,It's so green.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,15,"Oh, yes."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,16,"Once you get south of the Riverlands,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,17,very different sorts of trees start to take over.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,18,"Maple, elm, beech, poplar."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,19,The odd willow.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,20,"And of course now that summer's over,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,21,you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,22,"Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,23,You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,24,That's not any better being a nervous mute.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,25,I didn't think I'd ever come back here
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,26,after my father made me renounce my title
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,27,and inheritance
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,28,"and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,29,A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,30,And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,31,So you know what to tell them.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,32,That Little Sam is your baby.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,33,"Yes, now that's very important."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,34,"If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,35,he'll take you in.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,36,He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,37,And you can help teach him. Huh?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,38,What did you tell your family about me?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,39,I told them I met you in the North.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,40,Did you tell them how far north?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,41,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,42,You didn't tell them where I'm really from?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,43,You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,44,The thing is...
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,45,my father doesn't like wildlings.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,46,"He hoped I'd make a man of myself by ""killing some bloody wildlings,"""
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,47,so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,48,I think we're here.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,49,Sam.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,50,"Oh, Sam."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,51,"Oh, hello, Mother."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,52,I never thought I'd see you again.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,53,- You look wonderful. - Oh.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,54,Talla?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,55,"Gods, you're a woman now."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,56,Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,57,"- He has yellow teeth-- - That's enough, Talla."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,58,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,59,"Oh, my."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,60,You are lovely.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,61,"I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,62,"Oh, and this,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,63,this is our son Samwell.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,64,"Hello, little one."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,65,"It's me, your grandmother."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,66,May I hold him?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,67,"Yes, of course."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,68,Oh.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,69,"You have a curious mind, I can tell."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,70,You'll be a scholar like your father.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,71,Where is Father? And Dickon?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,72,They're on a hunt.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,73,<i>They'll join us</i> <i>for dinner.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,74,Come inside. Such a journey.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,75,You must be exhausted.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,76,"Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,77,"Oh, and a dress for dinner."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,78,You can wear one of mine.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,79,What's your color?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,80,Midnight blue or silver?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,81,"Silver, maybe. Come."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,82,You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,83,Is there no other way?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,84,You're afraid for her?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,85,Of course I'm afraid for her!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,86,It just seems very dangerous.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,87,She'll be protected the entire way.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,88,The Faith Militant are very stern
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,89,with those who overstep their bounds.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,90,And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,91,I suspect the gods will predispose the common people
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,92,to gentleness on her behalf.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,93,She's truly opened her heart to them.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,94,She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,95,And now she's devoted to the gods as well.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,96,Would you like to see her?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,97,Have they hurt you?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,98,Have they mistreated you?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,99,"- No, Your Grace. - I've missed you."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,100,More than you could know.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,101,We'll be together again soon
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,102,and everything will be better than it was before.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,103,Better how?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,104,Soon the--
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,105,walk of atonement.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,106,He says there's no other way.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,107,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,108,"Yes, a few times."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,109,Have you?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,110,"Yes, I have."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,111,"He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,112,You think I'm mad.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,113,I sound mad.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,114,"No. No, you don't."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,115,You-- you could never.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,116,"You're right, he's not."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,117,He's a lot more--
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,118,He is.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,119,There's something about him.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,120,His way of looking at the world.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,121,It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,122,It's taken me a while.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,123,He's helped me.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,124,What are you talking about?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,125,You're a good person. You've always been a good person.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,126,You're the best person I know.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,127,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,128,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,129,and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,130,"I never gave them what they really needed, though."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,131,I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,132,All those stories I told myself about who I was
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,133,and why I did the things I did.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,134,There were so many lies in those stories.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,135,I don't understand.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,136,It's all right. It really is.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,137,It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,138,What about Loras?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,139,I love my brother.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,140,I will always love my brother.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,141,His soul is pure and perfect.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,142,"His sins don't erase that purity,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,143,they only obscure it.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,144,He just needs to atone for them.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,145,We all do.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,146,"Sooner or later, one way or another."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,147,The gods have a plan for us all.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,148,It's hard to walk in this.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,149,It's beautiful.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,150,You're beautiful.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,151,"This venison, it's very tasty."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,152,Is it from today's hunt?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,153,"Well, no."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,154,We haven't been able to cure that one yet.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,155,<i>This is last week's.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,156,"Oh, of course. Sorry."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,157,Long journey.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,158,Brought it down from 70 yards.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,159,One shot.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,160,"Oh, that's a fair distance."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,161,So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,162,"Oh, yes. Yes."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,163,A good amount.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,164,"North of the Wall,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,165,"you don't hunt, you don't eat."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,166,Mm-hmm.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,167,Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,168,Rabbits.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,169,<i>Sometimes squirrels.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,170,"I say ""we,"" it's my friend Jon mostly."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,171,Sometimes Edd.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,172,"<i>Oh, and Gilly.</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,173,She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,174,"Um, huntress."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,175,<i>I imagine it's common</i> <i>where you're from.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,176,"We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,177,<i>who said he taught all</i> <i>his daughters how to hunt.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,178,Your father taught you to hunt?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,179,Our father would never teach us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,180,I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,181,That's enough of that.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,182,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,183,"Oh, yes. Yes, please."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,184,"Thank you, Mother."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,185,Not fat enough already?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,186,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,187,- He wants me to-- - I read your letter.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,188,You're to be a maester.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,189,Yes.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,190,"And once I have my chain,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,191,I'll return to Castle Black.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,192,I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,193,Something resembling a man at least.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,194,You managed to stay soft and fat.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,195,Your nose buried in books.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,196,Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,197,I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,198,"Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,199,He can wield a sword.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,200,He killed a Thenn.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,201,He killed a white walker.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,202,There's no such thing.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,203,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,204,He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,205,He risked his own life to save mine more than once.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,206,He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,207,Your way down to Castle Black?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,208,<i>Where did he kill</i> <i>a white walker?</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,209,Where are you from?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,210,How'd you come to meet my son?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,211,The Night's Watch came to our keep.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,212,- Where? - Gilly.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,213,- North of the Wall. - <i>North of the Wall?</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,214,You're a wildling.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,215,The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,216,and here I sit hosting one in my hall
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,217,<i>thanks to my son.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,218,See that sword?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,219,It's called Heartsbane.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,220,It's been in our family for 500 years.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,221,<i>It's Valyrian steel.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,222,<i>Only a handful of them</i> <i>left in the world.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,223,It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,224,To him.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,225,He will never wield that sword.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,226,"If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,227,it would be the end of this house.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,228,I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,229,and I made my peace with that.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,230,Who else would have him?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,231,But I overestimated him.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,232,<i>No.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,233,It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,234,"This you getting back at me, boy?"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,235,Hmm? Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,236,"<i>And you got what you</i> <i>were after, didn't you?</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,237,A bastard. A half-breed bastard.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,238,Your invitation into our home.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,239,"Come, my dear. Talla."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,240,I've lost my appetite.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,241,He dishonors us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,242,You dishonor yourself.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,243,Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,244,"To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,245,The bastard will be raised here.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,246,But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,247,I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,248,I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,249,I'm not angry at you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,250,I'm angry that horrible people
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,251,can treat good people that way and get away with it.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,252,When do you have to go?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,253,First light.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,254,Say good-bye to him for me.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,255,"You're not what he thinks you are, Sam."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,256,He doesn't know what you are.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,257,"Good-bye, Gilly."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,258,- Sam? - We're leaving.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,259,- What? - Get your things.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,260,I don't have any things.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,261,- What are you doing? - We belong together.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,262,All of us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,263,What about your mother and sister?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,264,"Oh, they'll understand."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,265,Your sister's dress.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,266,She won't mind.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,267,Looks better on you anyway.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,268,Sam.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,269,That's your father's sword.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,270,It's my family's sword.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,271,Sam.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,272,Won't he come for it?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,273,He can bloody well try.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,274,The lion and the rose are one.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,275,I thank the gods above.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,276,"And to you, my beauteous bride,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,277,I pledge undying love.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,278,Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,279,"I'll drink a toast to my new queen,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,280,for there is no one fairer.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,281,"Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,282,"Drink long and deep, my noble king,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,283,from this cup of sweet wine.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,284,The last drink he shall ever take.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,285,And vengeance shall be mine.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,286,Poison!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,287,Murder!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,288,I gasp. I-- I die.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,289,I limp.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,290,And it was he...
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,291,<i>...that poisoned me.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,292,My evil Uncle Imp.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,293,"Calm down, dear."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,294,My firstborn son.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,295,My golden lion
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,296,"foully, falsely slain."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,297,I pray you found a lasting peace
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,298,free from strife and pain.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,299,"Hear my prayer, O cruel gods."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,300,<i>Take my life instead.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,301,For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,302,"<i>Oh, woe.</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,303,"Oh, grief."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,304,"Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,305,All hope is lost.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,306,All joy is gone.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,307,And there is no tomorrow.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,308,What is that I hear and smell?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,309,<i>Someone I'll soon</i> <i>send to hell.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,310,It's time to see if truth they told
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,311,who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,312,You beast. You beast.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,313,You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,314,<i>No worse child</i> <i>ever stained this land.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,315,Curse the day I named you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,316,My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,317,<i>Then sail across</i> <i>the Narrow Sea</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,318,<i>to do unto you</i> <i>more treachery.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,319,Don't fear winter. Fear me!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,320,<i>Thank you.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,321,"<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i> <i>I give you Bianca,</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,322,<i>Clarenzo.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,323,I give you Bobono.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,324,I give you Camello.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,325,"<i>And last but not least,</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,326,sweet Lady Crane.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,327,Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,328,That crowd was shit.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,329,Girl.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,330,What are you doing back here?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,331,Nothing.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,332,I saw you the other day in the audience.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,333,How many times have you seen this stupid play?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,334,Three times.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,335,Did you pay?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,336,No.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,337,I remember when the players came to my village.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,338,"I didn't have any money, so I snuck in."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,339,Just like you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,340,"Saw the painted faces, the costumes,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,341,"listened to the songs,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,342,cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,343,"I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,344,You're very good.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,345,My final speech is shit.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,346,"But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,347,the writing's no good.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,348,So change it.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,349,"It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,350,How would you change it?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,351,The queen loves her son more than anything.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,352,And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,353,She wouldn't just cry.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,354,She would be angry.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,355,She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,356,What's your name?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,357,Mercy.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,358,"You have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,359,<i>Wonderful eyebrows.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,360,Do you like pretending to be other people?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,361,I have to go. My father's waiting for me.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,362,"Lady Crane, they loved you."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,363,They were sweet. Or drunk.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,364,Drunkenly sweet.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,365,No laugh for Ned's death.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,366,These people are worse than animals.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,367,But they loved her. They all love her.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,368,"Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,369,I do what I can with what I'm given.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,370,With what you're given?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,371,"Well, I was thinking--"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,372,"<i>Oh, we're all thinkers</i> <i>now, are we?</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,373,Full to the tits with ideas.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,374,"- I didn't mean-- - You have ideas, I have ideas,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,375,he has ideas.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,376,Why should my ideas have any more value than yours
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,377,simply because I've been doing this my whole life?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,378,Who is anyone to judge my work?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,379,This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,380,You have no right to an opinion.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,381,Careful of that one.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,382,She wants you dead.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,383,And?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,384,As I expected.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,385,A shame.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,386,A girl had many gifts.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,387,You promised me.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,388,Don't let her suffer.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,389,"Company, halt!"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,390,My lord.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,391,My lord.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,392,"My friends, the hour has come."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,393,Madness has overtaken this city
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,394,and grasped in its claws my children.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,395,But now we must drive it back
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,396,under the rocks whence it came.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,397,Madness has had its day!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,398,"<i>Forward, march!</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,399,"Rich or poor, noble or common,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,400,"if we sin, we must atone."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,401,Margaery of House Tyrell
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,402,<i>came to us a sinner.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,403,She stood before the gods
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,404,in the holy Sept and lied.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,405,She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,406,"She disgraced her house,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,407,"her king, and herself."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,408,"<i>Company, halt!</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,409,Face front!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,410,Turn!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,411,<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,412,Ser Jaime.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,413,Sorry to interrupt.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,414,<i>We're here for Queen Margaery</i> <i>and Ser Loras Tyrell.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,415,Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,416,I don't have the authority to give them to you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,417,And you don't have the authority to take them.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,418,That's right.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,419,Hyah.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,420,<i>Lock spears!</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,421,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,422,The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,423,You've already insulted one great house.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,424,<i>It won't happen twice.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,425,Every last sparrow will die
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,426,before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,427,To die in the service of the gods
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,428,would please each and every one of us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,429,We yearn for it.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,430,But there is no call for it today.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,431,There will be no walk of atonement.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,432,<i>Order up.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,433,Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,434,<i>by bringing another</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,435,into the true light of the Seven.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,436,Together we announce
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,437,<i>a new age of harmony.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,438,A holy alliance
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,439,between the Crown and the Faith.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,440,"<i>Long live King Tommen</i> <i>and bless you, Queen Margaery!</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,441,The Crown and the Faith
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,442,are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,443,Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,444,What's happening?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,445,He's beaten us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,446,That's what's happening.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,447,"When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,448,Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,449,to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,450,I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,451,You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,452,I have to answer to the gods.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,453,Not when you're sitting in that chair.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,454,The Crown's decision on this matter is final.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,455,Will I be walking naked in the streets?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,456,Or will I spend a few months in the Sept dungeons first
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,457,to teach me about the gods' mercy?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,458,You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,459,And you will continue to do so.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,460,But not in this city.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,461,You've lost it?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,462,"Yes, Father."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,463,"It's a castle, not a bloody sheep."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,464,Presumably you still know where it is.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,465,You didn't lose Riverrun.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,466,You let the Blackfish take it from you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,467,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,468,You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,469,You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,470,"Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,471,you couldn't find him.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,472,That's what it means to lose something.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,473,Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,474,I don't think it's fair to blame us--
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,475,"For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,476,swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,477,Not again. Riverrun is ours.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,478,Take it back.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,479,We don't have the men.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,480,We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,481,<i>The Mallisters have risen</i> <i>against us. And the Blackwoods.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,482,"<i>The Brotherhood Without Banners</i> <i>is rallying the commoners against us,</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,483,<i>raiding our supply trains</i> <i>and camps.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,484,<i>Riverrun can withstand</i> <i>a siege for a year.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,485,"If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,486,They're laughing at us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,487,All across the Riverlands
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,488,"right down to King's Landing,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,489,<i>they're laughing at us.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,490,I hear it in my sleep!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,491,"I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,492,And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,493,Take that castle back.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,494,"He'll never yield, Father."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,495,"Oh, he'll yield."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,496,You'll show him the knife you used
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,497,"to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,498,and you'll show him the knife you used
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,499,<i>to open</i> <i>his niece's throat.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,500,<i>And you'll remind him</i> <i>who it was</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,501,that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,502,His nephew.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,503,"<i>Cheer up, Lord Edmure.</i>"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,504,You're going home.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,505,I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,506,Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,507,because he's 400 years old.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,508,<i>Sent me with an army</i> <i>to the Riverlands</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,509,and a siege that could last months.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,510,Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,511,than in the Sept dungeons.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,512,I'm not going to the Riverlands.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,513,"What, then?"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,514,I'm going to give Bronn
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,515,the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,516,and have him gather the best killers he knows.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,517,I'll take them to the Sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,518,and every other sparrow head I can find.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,519,- You can't. - He has our son! He stole our son!
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,520,He's torn our family apart.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,521,How should we treat people who tear us apart?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,522,We should treat them without mercy and we will.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,523,"But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the Sept alive."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,524,"And without you, this is all for nothing."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,525,"Stand at the head of our army where you belong,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,526,where Father wanted you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,527,Show our men where their loyalties belong.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,528,"Show them what Lannisters are,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,529,what we do to our enemies.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,530,And take that stupid little castle back
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,531,because it's ours and because you can.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,532,You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,533,It will be a trial by combat.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,534,I have the Mountain.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,535,"They've made us both stronger, all of them."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,536,They have no idea how strong we are.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,537,No idea what we're going to do to them.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,538,We've always been together.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,539,We'll always be together.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,540,We're the only two people in the world.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,541,Why did you help us?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,542,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,543,The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,544,Now he lives again.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,545,"When I last saw you, you were a boy."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,546,A fearless boy.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,547,"Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,548,Who are you?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,549,Uncle Benjen.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,550,<i>The last letter</i> <i>Jon wrote me</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,551,said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,552,I led a ranging party deep into the North
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,553,to find white walkers.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,554,They found us.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,555,A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,556,Left me there to die.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,557,To turn.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,558,The Children found me.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,559,Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,560,How?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,561,The same way they made the walkers in the first place.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,562,You saw it yourself.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,563,Dragonglass.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,564,A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,565,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,566,I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,567,You must learn to control it
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,568,before the Night King comes.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,569,Drink.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,570,"One way or another,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,571,he will find his way to the world of men.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,572,"When he does,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,573,you will be there waiting for him.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,574,And you will be ready.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,575,<i>Everything all right?</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,576,<i>How many days' ride</i> <i>to Meereen?</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,577,<i>A week at best.</i>
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,578,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,579,"Dothraki and all their horses,"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,580,"the Unsullied, the Second Sons--"
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,581,"1,000 ships easily."
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,582,- Probably more. - And who has that many?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,583,Nobody.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,584,Nobody yet.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,585,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,586,And what then?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,587,I take what is mine.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,588,You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,589,What was I made for?
S06E06,Blood of My Blood,590,"You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."

S06E07,The Broken Man,1,That's it. Get it right to the top.
S06E07,The Broken Man,2,Steady. Steady.
S06E07,The Broken Man,3,Up she goes.
S06E07,The Broken Man,4,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,5,"Here you are, son."
S06E07,The Broken Man,6,"- Oh, gentlemen, please. - To my right."
S06E07,The Broken Man,7,"And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving."
S06E07,The Broken Man,8,"Come on, come on."
S06E07,The Broken Man,9,In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.
S06E07,The Broken Man,10,How many men did it take to cut you down?
S06E07,The Broken Man,11,Just one.
S06E07,The Broken Man,12,He must have been some kind of monster.
S06E07,The Broken Man,13,He was a woman.
S06E07,The Broken Man,14,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,15,I'm used to it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,16,"When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days."
S06E07,The Broken Man,17,The way you were stinking already
S06E07,The Broken Man,18,and you had bugs all over you
S06E07,The Broken Man,19,and bone was coming through right there.
S06E07,The Broken Man,20,I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,21,"Oh, nearly shit myself."
S06E07,The Broken Man,22,I reckoned you were gonna die
S06E07,The Broken Man,23,"by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't."
S06E07,The Broken Man,24,"Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,25,but you didn't. What kept you going?
S06E07,The Broken Man,26,Hate.
S06E07,The Broken Man,27,"No, there's a reason you're still here."
S06E07,The Broken Man,28,"Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill."
S06E07,The Broken Man,29,"No, a reason."
S06E07,The Broken Man,30,Gods aren't done with you yet.
S06E07,The Broken Man,31,I've heard that before.
S06E07,The Broken Man,32,"Man was talking about a different god, though."
S06E07,The Broken Man,33,"Well, maybe he was right."
S06E07,The Broken Man,34,I don't know much about the gods.
S06E07,The Broken Man,35,You're in the wrong line of work.
S06E07,The Broken Man,36,"Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches"
S06E07,The Broken Man,37,who think they know the word of god or gods.
S06E07,The Broken Man,38,I don't. I don't even know their real names.
S06E07,The Broken Man,39,Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods.
S06E07,The Broken Man,40,Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.
S06E07,The Broken Man,41,Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.
S06E07,The Broken Man,42,I don't know.
S06E07,The Broken Man,43,"What matters, I believe,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,44,is that there's something greater than us.
S06E07,The Broken Man,45,"And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."
S06E07,The Broken Man,46,You didn't know me back in my time.
S06E07,The Broken Man,47,You don't know the things I've done.
S06E07,The Broken Man,48,I've heard stories.
S06E07,The Broken Man,49,If the gods are real...
S06E07,The Broken Man,50,why haven't they punished me?
S06E07,The Broken Man,51,They have.
S06E07,The Broken Man,52,Your Grace.
S06E07,The Broken Man,53,What are we reading today?
S06E07,The Broken Man,54,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness."
S06E07,The Broken Man,55,"Chapter three, verse 12."
S06E07,The Broken Man,56,"Ah, ""As water rounds the stones, smoothing..."""
S06E07,The Broken Man,57,"""Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love"
S06E07,The Broken Man,58,calm a man's brute nature.
S06E07,The Broken Man,59,"A wife salves her husband's wounds,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,60,"a mother sings her son to sleep."""
S06E07,The Broken Man,61,You learn quickly.
S06E07,The Broken Man,62,"There are some who know every verse of the sacred text,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,63,but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood
S06E07,The Broken Man,64,and savages who can't read at all
S06E07,The Broken Man,65,who understand the Father's wisdom.
S06E07,The Broken Man,66,For years I pretended
S06E07,The Broken Man,67,"to love the poor, the afflicted."
S06E07,The Broken Man,68,"I had pity for them, but I never loved them."
S06E07,The Broken Man,69,They disgusted me.
S06E07,The Broken Man,70,They are hard to love.
S06E07,The Broken Man,71,"The poor disgust us because they are us,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,72,shorn of our illusions.
S06E07,The Broken Man,73,They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.
S06E07,The Broken Man,74,How'd we smell without perfume.
S06E07,The Broken Man,75,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
S06E07,The Broken Man,76,Of course.
S06E07,The Broken Man,77,"The king mentioned that since your reunion,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,78,you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,79,No.
S06E07,The Broken Man,80,"You have a duty, Your Grace."
S06E07,The Broken Man,81,"To your husband, your king, your country,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,82,to the gods themselves.
S06E07,The Broken Man,83,It's just...
S06E07,The Broken Man,84,the desires that once drove me no longer do.
S06E07,The Broken Man,85,Congress does not require desire
S06E07,The Broken Man,86,"on the woman's part, only patience."
S06E07,The Broken Man,87,The king must have an heir
S06E07,The Broken Man,88,if we are to continue our good work.
S06E07,The Broken Man,89,Forgive me.
S06E07,The Broken Man,90,Sometimes the true path is hard to find.
S06E07,The Broken Man,91,Hard to find
S06E07,The Broken Man,92,and harder still to walk upon.
S06E07,The Broken Man,93,But you've made great progress.
S06E07,The Broken Man,94,I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
S06E07,The Broken Man,95,My grandmother?
S06E07,The Broken Man,96,Yes.
S06E07,The Broken Man,97,"The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,98,"a strong woman,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,99,and an unrepentant sinner.
S06E07,The Broken Man,100,You must teach her the new way
S06E07,The Broken Man,101,as she taught you the old.
S06E07,The Broken Man,102,"Or I fear for her safety,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,103,body and soul.
S06E07,The Broken Man,104,Does it move or talk?
S06E07,The Broken Man,105,I want to speak with you alone.
S06E07,The Broken Man,106,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
S06E07,The Broken Man,107,"Oh, this is madness!"
S06E07,The Broken Man,108,"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear."
S06E07,The Broken Man,109,All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...
S06E07,The Broken Man,110,- Grandmother. - Until I tell them to stop.
S06E07,The Broken Man,111,If I tell them to stop.
S06E07,The Broken Man,112,"- You could use a good bashing. - Grandmother, please."
S06E07,The Broken Man,113,What have they done to you?
S06E07,The Broken Man,114,"You marched against the High Sparrow,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,115,- against the Faith. - We marched for you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,116,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't."
S06E07,The Broken Man,117,- They showed mercy. - And what about your brother?
S06E07,The Broken Man,118,What mercy did they show him?
S06E07,The Broken Man,119,Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.
S06E07,The Broken Man,120,"If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden."
S06E07,The Broken Man,121,He'll have to renounce his name and title...
S06E07,The Broken Man,122,- Have you lost your mind? - And live his life as a penitent.
S06E07,The Broken Man,123,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
S06E07,The Broken Man,124,He can begin again.
S06E07,The Broken Man,125,As a mindless fanatic.
S06E07,The Broken Man,126,As a free man.
S06E07,The Broken Man,127,You will leave for Highgarden today.
S06E07,The Broken Man,128,There is no law that says you must stay here.
S06E07,The Broken Man,129,I am the queen.
S06E07,The Broken Man,130,It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
S06E07,The Broken Man,131,"But you should leave, Grandmother."
S06E07,The Broken Man,132,Your place is at home.
S06E07,The Broken Man,133,I will never leave you. Never.
S06E07,The Broken Man,134,You must.
S06E07,The Broken Man,135,Go home.
S06E07,The Broken Man,136,Find comfort in prayer and good works.
S06E07,The Broken Man,137,The Mother watches over us all.
S06E07,The Broken Man,138,"I'll see you soon, my dear."
S06E07,The Broken Man,139,"Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
S06E07,The Broken Man,140,Shall we pray?
S06E07,The Broken Man,141,"We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,142,"when the time comes and we meant it,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,143,but this isn't what we agreed to.
S06E07,The Broken Man,144,These aren't white walkers.
S06E07,The Broken Man,145,This isn't an army of the dead.
S06E07,The Broken Man,146,This isn't our fight.
S06E07,The Broken Man,147,"If it weren't for him, none of us would be here."
S06E07,The Broken Man,148,All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.
S06E07,The Broken Man,149,And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.
S06E07,The Broken Man,150,Remember Mance's camp?
S06E07,The Broken Man,151,It stretched all the way to the horizon.
S06E07,The Broken Man,152,And look at us now.
S06E07,The Broken Man,153,Look what's left of us.
S06E07,The Broken Man,154,"And if we lose this, we're gone."
S06E07,The Broken Man,155,"Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations."
S06E07,The Broken Man,156,Be like we were never there at all.
S06E07,The Broken Man,157,We'll be the last of the free folk.
S06E07,The Broken Man,158,That's what'll happen to you if we lose.
S06E07,The Broken Man,159,"The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,160,they know you're here.
S06E07,The Broken Man,161,They know that more than half of you are women and children.
S06E07,The Broken Man,162,"After they finish with me, they'll come for you."
S06E07,The Broken Man,163,You're right.
S06E07,The Broken Man,164,This isn't your fight.
S06E07,The Broken Man,165,You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.
S06E07,The Broken Man,166,I shouldn't be asking you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,167,It's not the deal we made.
S06E07,The Broken Man,168,"I need you with me if we're going to beat them,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,169,and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.
S06E07,The Broken Man,170,The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk
S06E07,The Broken Man,171,when no other southerners would.
S06E07,The Broken Man,172,He died for us.
S06E07,The Broken Man,173,"If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards."
S06E07,The Broken Man,174,"And if that's what we are,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,175,we deserve to be the last of the free folk.
S06E07,The Broken Man,176,Snow.
S06E07,The Broken Man,177,Are you sure they'll come?
S06E07,The Broken Man,178,We're not clever like you southerners.
S06E07,The Broken Man,179,"When we say we'll do something, we do it."
S06E07,The Broken Man,180,I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
S06E07,The Broken Man,181,That is hardly your concern.
S06E07,The Broken Man,182,Your grandson is still a prisoner.
S06E07,The Broken Man,183,You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
S06E07,The Broken Man,184,Loras rots in a cell because of you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,185,The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,186,Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you
S06E07,The Broken Man,187,and your stupidity.
S06E07,The Broken Man,188,You're right.
S06E07,The Broken Man,189,I made a terrible mistake.
S06E07,The Broken Man,190,I carry it with me every single day.
S06E07,The Broken Man,191,Good.
S06E07,The Broken Man,192,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.
S06E07,The Broken Man,193,And now we must fight them together.
S06E07,The Broken Man,194,We need each other.
S06E07,The Broken Man,195,I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.
S06E07,The Broken Man,196,"At a certain age, it's hard to recall."
S06E07,The Broken Man,197,But the truly vile do stand out through the years.
S06E07,The Broken Man,198,Do you remember the way you smirked at me
S06E07,The Broken Man,199,when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?
S06E07,The Broken Man,200,I do. I'll never forget it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,201,You love your granddaughter.
S06E07,The Broken Man,202,I love my son.
S06E07,The Broken Man,203,It's the only truth I know.
S06E07,The Broken Man,204,We must defend them.
S06E07,The Broken Man,205,I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can
S06E07,The Broken Man,206,before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.
S06E07,The Broken Man,207,"If you're half as bright as you think you are,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,208,"you'll find a way out of here, too."
S06E07,The Broken Man,209,Never.
S06E07,The Broken Man,210,I'll never leave my son.
S06E07,The Broken Man,211,"What'll you do, then?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,212,You have no support. Not anymore.
S06E07,The Broken Man,213,Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.
S06E07,The Broken Man,214,The rest of your family have abandoned you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,215,The people despise you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,216,"You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them."
S06E07,The Broken Man,217,You're going to kill them all by yourself?
S06E07,The Broken Man,218,"You've lost, Cersei."
S06E07,The Broken Man,219,It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.
S06E07,The Broken Man,220,Pick the pace up.
S06E07,The Broken Man,221,Keep going.
S06E07,The Broken Man,222,Keep it moving!
S06E07,The Broken Man,223,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege."
S06E07,The Broken Man,224,Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.
S06E07,The Broken Man,225,Someone certainly does.
S06E07,The Broken Man,226,"Oh, no. Not me."
S06E07,The Broken Man,227,I'm just an upjumped sellsword.
S06E07,The Broken Man,228,You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
S06E07,The Broken Man,229,"Aye, knights don't get paid."
S06E07,The Broken Man,230,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
S06E07,The Broken Man,231,That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
S06E07,The Broken Man,232,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.
S06E07,The Broken Man,233,You can be the right hand I lost.
S06E07,The Broken Man,234,You promised me a lordship and a castle
S06E07,The Broken Man,235,and a highborn beauty for a wife.
S06E07,The Broken Man,236,And you'll get all three. A Lannister always...
S06E07,The Broken Man,237,Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,238,"Come out and fight us, Blackfish."
S06E07,The Broken Man,239,We have Lord Edmure.
S06E07,The Broken Man,240,Yield the castle or we'll hang him.
S06E07,The Broken Man,241,This is your last warning.
S06E07,The Broken Man,242,Yield the castle.
S06E07,The Broken Man,243,"You think I won't do it, old man?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,244,I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.
S06E07,The Broken Man,245,And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.
S06E07,The Broken Man,246,Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
S06E07,The Broken Man,247,"Go on, then. Cut his throat."
S06E07,The Broken Man,248,"Lothar, is it?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,249,Ser Jaime.
S06E07,The Broken Man,250,We didn't know you were coming.
S06E07,The Broken Man,251,'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.
S06E07,The Broken Man,252,"You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
S06E07,The Broken Man,253,Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
S06E07,The Broken Man,254,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,255,Walder.
S06E07,The Broken Man,256,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
S06E07,The Broken Man,257,Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.
S06E07,The Broken Man,258,Now let's say I threatened to hit you
S06E07,The Broken Man,259,"unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking."
S06E07,The Broken Man,260,- What do you think I'd do? - I don't give a rat's...
S06E07,The Broken Man,261,I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.
S06E07,The Broken Man,262,Have him bathed and fed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,263,Unless you'd like to take his place.
S06E07,The Broken Man,264,"Apologies, Ser Jaime."
S06E07,The Broken Man,265,Do as he says.
S06E07,The Broken Man,266,The siege is now under my command.
S06E07,The Broken Man,267,"The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,268,"he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
S06E07,The Broken Man,269,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches.
S06E07,The Broken Man,270,Set pickets every hundred yards.
S06E07,The Broken Man,271,And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
S06E07,The Broken Man,272,Those are our siege towers...
S06E07,The Broken Man,273,"As I said, the siege is under my command."
S06E07,The Broken Man,274,"If that's not to your liking, go home."
S06E07,The Broken Man,275,Get word to the Blackfish.
S06E07,The Broken Man,276,I want a parley.
S06E07,The Broken Man,277,A parley or a fight?
S06E07,The Broken Man,278,He's an old man.
S06E07,The Broken Man,279,You've got one hand.
S06E07,The Broken Man,280,My money's on the old boy.
S06E07,The Broken Man,281,Lady Mormont.
S06E07,The Broken Man,282,Welcome to Bear Island.
S06E07,The Broken Man,283,"I remember when you were born, my lady."
S06E07,The Broken Man,284,You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.
S06E07,The Broken Man,285,"It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
S06E07,The Broken Man,286,I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty
S06E07,The Broken Man,287,or any other kind of beauty.
S06E07,The Broken Man,288,"She was a great warrior, though."
S06E07,The Broken Man,289,She died fighting for your brother Robb.
S06E07,The Broken Man,290,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna."
S06E07,The Broken Man,291,He was also a great warrior and an honorable man.
S06E07,The Broken Man,292,I was his steward. In fact...
S06E07,The Broken Man,293,I think we've had enough small talk. Why are you here?
S06E07,The Broken Man,294,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black
S06E07,The Broken Man,295,before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,296,He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.
S06E07,The Broken Man,297,- It said... - I remember what it said.
S06E07,The Broken Man,298,Bear Island knows no king
S06E07,The Broken Man,299,but the King in the North whose name is Stark.
S06E07,The Broken Man,300,"Robb is gone,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,301,but House Stark is not.
S06E07,The Broken Man,302,And it needs your support now more than ever.
S06E07,The Broken Man,303,I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.
S06E07,The Broken Man,304,"As far as I understand, you're a Snow"
S06E07,The Broken Man,305,and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.
S06E07,The Broken Man,306,Or is she a Lannister?
S06E07,The Broken Man,307,I've heard conflicting reports.
S06E07,The Broken Man,308,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady."
S06E07,The Broken Man,309,But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.
S06E07,The Broken Man,310,"If you say so. In any case,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,311,you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.
S06E07,The Broken Man,312,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady."
S06E07,The Broken Man,313,It is our duty to stop him.
S06E07,The Broken Man,314,Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.
S06E07,The Broken Man,315,"What you have to understand, my lady, is that..."
S06E07,The Broken Man,316,I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.
S06E07,The Broken Man,317,So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
S06E07,The Broken Man,318,"If it please, my lady,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,319,I understand how you feel.
S06E07,The Broken Man,320,"I don't know you, Ser...?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,321,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
S06E07,The Broken Man,322,You needn't ask your maester about my house.
S06E07,The Broken Man,323,It's rather new.
S06E07,The Broken Man,324,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth."
S06E07,The Broken Man,325,How is it you understand how I feel?
S06E07,The Broken Man,326,You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.
S06E07,The Broken Man,327,Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.
S06E07,The Broken Man,328,I never thought I'd be in my position.
S06E07,The Broken Man,329,"I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler."
S06E07,The Broken Man,330,And now I find myself addressing the lady
S06E07,The Broken Man,331,of a great house in time of war.
S06E07,The Broken Man,332,But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.
S06E07,The Broken Man,333,It's our war.
S06E07,The Broken Man,334,"Go on, Ser Davos."
S06E07,The Broken Man,335,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,336,made that man his steward.
S06E07,The Broken Man,337,He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew
S06E07,The Broken Man,338,"he had the courage to do what was right,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,339,even if it meant giving his life.
S06E07,The Broken Man,340,Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood
S06E07,The Broken Man,341,that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.
S06E07,The Broken Man,342,It's between the living and the dead.
S06E07,The Broken Man,343,"And make no mistake, my lady,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,344,the dead are coming.
S06E07,The Broken Man,345,Is this true?
S06E07,The Broken Man,346,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.
S06E07,The Broken Man,347,I fought them at Hardhome.
S06E07,The Broken Man,348,We both lost.
S06E07,The Broken Man,349,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided."
S06E07,The Broken Man,350,And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.
S06E07,The Broken Man,351,"You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand."
S06E07,The Broken Man,352,But there's no hiding from this.
S06E07,The Broken Man,353,We have to fight and we need to do it together.
S06E07,The Broken Man,354,"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years."
S06E07,The Broken Man,355,We will not break faith today.
S06E07,The Broken Man,356,"Thank you, my lady."
S06E07,The Broken Man,357,How many fighting men can we expect?
S06E07,The Broken Man,358,62.
S06E07,The Broken Man,359,"- 62? - We are not a large house,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,360,but we're a proud one.
S06E07,The Broken Man,361,And every man from Bear Island
S06E07,The Broken Man,362,fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.
S06E07,The Broken Man,363,"If they're half as ferocious as their lady,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,364,the Boltons are doomed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,365,Kingslayer.
S06E07,The Broken Man,366,Blackfish.
S06E07,The Broken Man,367,I assume you're here
S06E07,The Broken Man,368,to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.
S06E07,The Broken Man,369,I don't see Sansa and Arya.
S06E07,The Broken Man,370,- I don't have them. - Pity.
S06E07,The Broken Man,371,Do you wish to resume your captivity?
S06E07,The Broken Man,372,Then why are you here?
S06E07,The Broken Man,373,You know why I'm here.
S06E07,The Broken Man,374,This castle belongs to House Frey.
S06E07,The Broken Man,375,You're trespassing.
S06E07,The Broken Man,376,"In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or..."
S06E07,The Broken Man,377,Or you'll kill Edmure?
S06E07,The Broken Man,378,My nephew's marked for death no matter what.
S06E07,The Broken Man,379,Hang him and be done with it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,380,It won't stop with Edmure.
S06E07,The Broken Man,381,You'll force me to storm the castle.
S06E07,The Broken Man,382,Hundreds will die.
S06E07,The Broken Man,383,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.
S06E07,The Broken Man,384,If you can breach the walls.
S06E07,The Broken Man,385,We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,386,"But if you surrender,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,387,I'll spare the lives of your men.
S06E07,The Broken Man,388,On my honor.
S06E07,The Broken Man,389,Your honor?
S06E07,The Broken Man,390,Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
S06E07,The Broken Man,391,"The war is over, ser."
S06E07,The Broken Man,392,Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?
S06E07,The Broken Man,393,"As long as I'm standing, the war is not over."
S06E07,The Broken Man,394,This is my home.
S06E07,The Broken Man,395,I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,396,So you can either attack
S06E07,The Broken Man,397,or try to starve us out.
S06E07,The Broken Man,398,We have enough provisions for two years.
S06E07,The Broken Man,399,"Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,400,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.
S06E07,The Broken Man,401,Why did you come treat with me?
S06E07,The Broken Man,402,Sieges are dull.
S06E07,The Broken Man,403,"And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
S06E07,The Broken Man,404,"Well, now you have."
S06E07,The Broken Man,405,"Aye, now I have."
S06E07,The Broken Man,406,I'm disappointed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,407,The answer is no.
S06E07,The Broken Man,408,"- Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. - I've heard enough."
S06E07,The Broken Man,409,We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.
S06E07,The Broken Man,410,The Boltons helped us do it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,411,Now you want me to fight against them?
S06E07,The Broken Man,412,I could be skinned for even talking to you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,413,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton...
S06E07,The Broken Man,414,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
S06E07,The Broken Man,415,House Mormont.
S06E07,The Broken Man,416,And?
S06E07,The Broken Man,417,We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...
S06E07,The Broken Man,418,I don't care about ravens.
S06E07,The Broken Man,419,You're asking me to join your army.
S06E07,The Broken Man,420,Who is fighting in this army?
S06E07,The Broken Man,421,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
S06E07,The Broken Man,422,Then the rumors are true.
S06E07,The Broken Man,423,I didn't dare believe them.
S06E07,The Broken Man,424,I received you out of respect for your father.
S06E07,The Broken Man,425,Now I would like you to leave.
S06E07,The Broken Man,426,House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home
S06E07,The Broken Man,427,to fight alongside wildlings.
S06E07,The Broken Man,428,- Lord Glover. - There's nothing else to say.
S06E07,The Broken Man,429,I would remind you that House Glover
S06E07,The Broken Man,430,is pledged to House Stark.
S06E07,The Broken Man,431,Sworn to answer when called upon.
S06E07,The Broken Man,432,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries."
S06E07,The Broken Man,433,We wept when we heard of your father's death.
S06E07,The Broken Man,434,"When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call"
S06E07,The Broken Man,435,and hailed him King in the North.
S06E07,The Broken Man,436,And where was King Robb
S06E07,The Broken Man,437,when the ironborn attacked this castle?
S06E07,The Broken Man,438,When they threw my wife and children in prison
S06E07,The Broken Man,439,and brutalized and killed our subjects?
S06E07,The Broken Man,440,Taking up with a foreign whore.
S06E07,The Broken Man,441,Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
S06E07,The Broken Man,442,"I served House Stark once,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,443,but House Stark is dead.
S06E07,The Broken Man,444,Why did we have to come here?
S06E07,The Broken Man,445,Some of us still like it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,446,Have a drink at least.
S06E07,The Broken Man,447,I don't want one.
S06E07,The Broken Man,448,"Don't go far, love."
S06E07,The Broken Man,449,I'll find you in a bit.
S06E07,The Broken Man,450,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.
S06E07,The Broken Man,451,Doesn't interest you anymore?
S06E07,The Broken Man,452,I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,453,"I'll never hurt you, little brother."
S06E07,The Broken Man,454,Don't you know that?
S06E07,The Broken Man,455,You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
S06E07,The Broken Man,456,"Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
S06E07,The Broken Man,457,He'll find us.
S06E07,The Broken Man,458,It's a great big world and we have fast ships.
S06E07,The Broken Man,459,Drink.
S06E07,The Broken Man,460,I don't want any.
S06E07,The Broken Man,461,I don't care what you want. Drink.
S06E07,The Broken Man,462,Drink it all.
S06E07,The Broken Man,463,"You're ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years."
S06E07,The Broken Man,464,Some bad years?
S06E07,The Broken Man,465,But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.
S06E07,The Broken Man,466,Drink the goddamn ale.
S06E07,The Broken Man,467,Now listen to me.
S06E07,The Broken Man,468,I need you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,469,"The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender."
S06E07,The Broken Man,470,Can you find him for me?
S06E07,The Broken Man,471,Drink.
S06E07,The Broken Man,472,You escaped. You hear me?
S06E07,The Broken Man,473,You got away and you're never going back.
S06E07,The Broken Man,474,We'll get justice for you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,475,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
S06E07,The Broken Man,476,"Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink."
S06E07,The Broken Man,477,Listen to me.
S06E07,The Broken Man,478,"If you're so broken that there's no coming back,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,479,take a knife and cut your wrists.
S06E07,The Broken Man,480,End it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,481,"But if you're staying, Theon, I need you."
S06E07,The Broken Man,482,We're gonna sail to Meereen.
S06E07,The Broken Man,483,We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.
S06E07,The Broken Man,484,And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.
S06E07,The Broken Man,485,Are you with me?
S06E07,The Broken Man,486,Are you really with me?
S06E07,The Broken Man,487,"Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,488,I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.
S06E07,The Broken Man,489,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
S06E07,The Broken Man,490,And that's a good thing?
S06E07,The Broken Man,491,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.
S06E07,The Broken Man,492,He chose this place for a reason.
S06E07,The Broken Man,493,Those mountains are a natural fortification.
S06E07,The Broken Man,494,There's a stream down there for the horses.
S06E07,The Broken Man,495,We're not staying here long.
S06E07,The Broken Man,496,Another storm could hit any day.
S06E07,The Broken Man,497,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis"
S06E07,The Broken Man,498,as much as the Boltons did.
S06E07,The Broken Man,499,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
S06E07,The Broken Man,500,"2,000 wildlings,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,501,"200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins..."
S06E07,The Broken Man,502,62 Mormonts.
S06E07,The Broken Man,503,It's not what we'd hoped for.
S06E07,The Broken Man,504,But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
S06E07,The Broken Man,505,For fuck's sake.
S06E07,The Broken Man,506,So he's your most trusted advisor now?
S06E07,The Broken Man,507,Because he secured 62 men from a 10-year-old?
S06E07,The Broken Man,508,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you
S06E07,The Broken Man,509,and he served Stannis for years.
S06E07,The Broken Man,510,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,511,"who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,512,It's not enough. We need more men.
S06E07,The Broken Man,513,There's no time.
S06E07,The Broken Man,514,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord..."
S06E07,The Broken Man,515,We fight with the army we have.
S06E07,The Broken Man,516,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"
S06E07,The Broken Man,517,"This'll be it, now."
S06E07,The Broken Man,518,"Right, now we don't need to be fighting..."
S06E07,The Broken Man,519,- Who the fuck are you? - Hold on.
S06E07,The Broken Man,520,"Yeah, who the fuck are you?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,521,I was a soldier once.
S06E07,The Broken Man,522,All my superiors thought I was brave.
S06E07,The Broken Man,523,"I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight."
S06E07,The Broken Man,524,Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.
S06E07,The Broken Man,525,"That's all I was, a coward."
S06E07,The Broken Man,526,We followed orders no matter the orders.
S06E07,The Broken Man,527,Burn that village.
S06E07,The Broken Man,528,"Fine, I'm your arsonist."
S06E07,The Broken Man,529,"Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief."
S06E07,The Broken Man,530,Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.
S06E07,The Broken Man,531,I'm your murderer.
S06E07,The Broken Man,532,"I remember once a woman screaming at us,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,533,calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.
S06E07,The Broken Man,534,But we weren't animals.
S06E07,The Broken Man,535,Animals are true to their nature
S06E07,The Broken Man,536,and we had betrayed ours.
S06E07,The Broken Man,537,I cut that young boy's throat myself
S06E07,The Broken Man,538,as his mother screamed
S06E07,The Broken Man,539,and my friends held her back.
S06E07,The Broken Man,540,That night...
S06E07,The Broken Man,541,I felt such shame.
S06E07,The Broken Man,542,"Shame was so heavy on me,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,543,"I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep."
S06E07,The Broken Man,544,All I could do was stare into that dark sky
S06E07,The Broken Man,545,and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.
S06E07,The Broken Man,546,I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
S06E07,The Broken Man,547,"Now, I know I can never bring that lad back."
S06E07,The Broken Man,548,All I can do with time I've got left
S06E07,The Broken Man,549,is bring a little goodness into the world.
S06E07,The Broken Man,550,"That's all any of us can do, isn't it?"
S06E07,The Broken Man,551,"Never too late to stop robbing people,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,552,to stop killing people.
S06E07,The Broken Man,553,Start helping people.
S06E07,The Broken Man,554,It's never too late to come back.
S06E07,The Broken Man,555,And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.
S06E07,The Broken Man,556,It's not even about the gods. It's about you.
S06E07,The Broken Man,557,Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
S06E07,The Broken Man,558,"Seven save you, friends."
S06E07,The Broken Man,559,How can we help you?
S06E07,The Broken Man,560,What are you doing here?
S06E07,The Broken Man,561,"Well, we're talking about life."
S06E07,The Broken Man,562,You?
S06E07,The Broken Man,563,Protecting the people.
S06E07,The Broken Man,564,"Well, we thank you for your protection."
S06E07,The Broken Man,565,Who are you protecting us from?
S06E07,The Broken Man,566,Do you have any horses?
S06E07,The Broken Man,567,No horses.
S06E07,The Broken Man,568,No gold. No steel.
S06E07,The Broken Man,569,"Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
S06E07,The Broken Man,570,I'm sure it is.
S06E07,The Broken Man,571,"You're welcome to stay for supper,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,572,but we have hungry mouths here.
S06E07,The Broken Man,573,Stay safe.
S06E07,The Broken Man,574,The night is dark and full of terrors.
S06E07,The Broken Man,575,"""Seven save you, friends."""
S06E07,The Broken Man,576,I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
S06E07,The Broken Man,577,They don't believe in your Seven.
S06E07,The Broken Man,578,They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
S06E07,The Broken Man,579,"Aye, well, all are welcome here."
S06E07,The Broken Man,580,"Anyway, we got nothing for them."
S06E07,The Broken Man,581,"Sure, you do. You've got food,"
S06E07,The Broken Man,582,you've got steel even if you say you don't.
S06E07,The Broken Man,583,And you've got women.
S06E07,The Broken Man,584,What do you want to do? Fight them?
S06E07,The Broken Man,585,Kill them?
S06E07,The Broken Man,586,It'd be you against all of them.
S06E07,The Broken Man,587,"I mean, these people don't know how to fight."
S06E07,The Broken Man,588,You do.
S06E07,The Broken Man,589,I'm done with fighting.
S06E07,The Broken Man,590,Even if it's to protect yourself?
S06E07,The Broken Man,591,Violence is a disease.
S06E07,The Broken Man,592,You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
S06E07,The Broken Man,593,"You don't cure it by dying, either."
S06E07,The Broken Man,594,You've done enough work for one day.
S06E07,The Broken Man,595,Come on up for some supper.
S06E07,The Broken Man,596,It's gonna be a cold night.
S06E07,The Broken Man,597,We'll need firewood.
S06E07,The Broken Man,598,I'll save you a bowl of stew.
S06E07,The Broken Man,599,Might even have some ale hidden away.
S06E07,The Broken Man,600,He's not a lying man.
S06E07,The Broken Man,601,He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.
S06E07,The Broken Man,602,I'm inclined to believe him.
S06E07,The Broken Man,603,I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
S06E07,The Broken Man,604,You're Westerosi.
S06E07,The Broken Man,605,What do you care?
S06E07,The Broken Man,606,I want to book passage home.
S06E07,The Broken Man,607,You? Can't afford it.
S06E07,The Broken Man,608,Where'd you steal this from?
S06E07,The Broken Man,609,Why do you care?
S06E07,The Broken Man,610,We leave in two days.
S06E07,The Broken Man,611,You can have a hammock in steerage.
S06E07,The Broken Man,612,I want a cabin.
S06E07,The Broken Man,613,And we'll leave at dawn.
S06E07,The Broken Man,614,See you at sunrise.
S06E07,The Broken Man,615,Sweet girl.

S06E08,No One,3,<i>My son.</i>
S06E08,No One,4,My firstborn son.
S06E08,No One,5,"My child king, hush."
S06E08,No One,6,"Listen to the gods, for you they sing."
S06E08,No One,7,"Fight no more, sweet child."
S06E08,No One,8,Your wars are won.
S06E08,No One,9,The wolves are buried
S06E08,No One,10,and the false stag done.
S06E08,No One,11,"Shut your blue eyes, my love."
S06E08,No One,12,Let the crown fall.
S06E08,No One,13,The Father above beckons you to his hall.
S06E08,No One,14,In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.
S06E08,No One,15,But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore
S06E08,No One,16,and my brother the Imp
S06E08,No One,17,who killed his own king.
S06E08,No One,18,"Born amongst lions, our curse from within."
S06E08,No One,19,"I will slay him, I swear."
S06E08,No One,20,"With noose or with knife,"
S06E08,No One,21,"though it take me a fortnight,"
S06E08,No One,22,a moon or my life.
S06E08,No One,23,<i>What is that</i> <i>I hear and smell?</i>
S06E08,No One,24,- <i> Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>
S06E08,No One,25,<i>It's time to see</i> <i>if truth they told</i>
S06E08,No One,26,<i>who said Tywin Lannister</i> <i>shits gold.</i>
S06E08,No One,27,<i>Get the wig!</i>
S06E08,No One,28,"<i>You beast, you beast.</i> <i>You killed my wife.</i>"
S06E08,No One,29,<i> And now you've taken</i> <i>your father's life.</i>
S06E08,No One,30,<i>No worse child</i> <i>ever stained this land.</i>
S06E08,No One,31,<i>I curse the day I named you.</i>
S06E08,No One,32,<i>My greatest crime!</i>
S06E08,No One,33,You're good at that.
S06E08,No One,34,Where did you learn?
S06E08,No One,35,I'm a jealous woman.
S06E08,No One,36,I've always liked bad men
S06E08,No One,37,and they've always liked me.
S06E08,No One,38,They'd come home wherever home was that night
S06E08,No One,39,stinking of some whore's perfume.
S06E08,No One,40,So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.
S06E08,No One,41,"And then I'd feel terrible,"
S06E08,No One,42,so I'd patch them up.
S06E08,No One,43,<i>I got good</i> <i>at patching them up.</i>
S06E08,No One,44,And good at putting holes in them.
S06E08,No One,45,And that.
S06E08,No One,46,What happened to the actress?
S06E08,No One,47,<i>The one who wanted</i> <i>you dead.</i>
S06E08,No One,48,Bianca.
S06E08,No One,49,She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress
S06E08,No One,50,after what I did to her face.
S06E08,No One,51,Mmm.
S06E08,No One,52,I never did learn to cook.
S06E08,No One,53,But eat. Eat. You need it.
S06E08,No One,54,The company is moving on to Pentos soon.
S06E08,No One,55,You should come with us.
S06E08,No One,56,- I can't. - Why not?
S06E08,No One,57,Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.
S06E08,No One,58,"And besides, we need a new actress."
S06E08,No One,59,I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
S06E08,No One,60,Come with us.
S06E08,No One,61,What's left for you here?
S06E08,No One,62,You wouldn't be safe.
S06E08,No One,63,Not while she's looking for me.
S06E08,No One,64,<i>Who?</i>
S06E08,No One,65,She doesn't have a name.
S06E08,No One,66,Where will you go?
S06E08,No One,67,Essos is east and Westeros is west.
S06E08,No One,68,But what's west of Westeros?
S06E08,No One,69,I don't know.
S06E08,No One,70,Nobody does.
S06E08,No One,71,<i>That's where</i> <i>all the maps stop.</i>
S06E08,No One,72,"The edge of the world, maybe."
S06E08,No One,73,<i>I'd like to see that.</i>
S06E08,No One,74,- What's that? - Milk of the poppy.
S06E08,No One,75,I don't want any.
S06E08,No One,76,Sleep is the only way you'll heal.
S06E08,No One,77,"Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will."
S06E08,No One,78,"Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
S06E08,No One,79,I was a famous kisser.
S06E08,No One,80,You lads know how to kiss proper?
S06E08,No One,81,Course we do.
S06E08,No One,82,"This is for masters, this technique."
S06E08,No One,83,- You're not ready. - I'm ready.
S06E08,No One,84,He says he's ready.
S06E08,No One,85,"All right. Now, pay attention."
S06E08,No One,86,You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.
S06E08,No One,87,Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.
S06E08,No One,88,Very romantic.
S06E08,No One,89,"Take your middle finger, yeah,"
S06E08,No One,90,and you jam it right up her bunghole.
S06E08,No One,91,<i>So fucking close!</i>
S06E08,No One,92,"Ah, it smells like pussy to me."
S06E08,No One,93,"Look at him. You get hard, boy?"
S06E08,No One,94,Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
S06E08,No One,95,"Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?"
S06E08,No One,96,Where's the other one?
S06E08,No One,97,- The one with the yellow cloak. - Fuck you!
S06E08,No One,98,"Those are your last words, fuck you?"
S06E08,No One,99,"Come on, you can do better."
S06E08,No One,100,Cunt!
S06E08,No One,101,"You're shit at dying, you know that?"
S06E08,No One,102,_
S06E08,No One,103,_
S06E08,No One,104,_
S06E08,No One,105,I'd call that a successful gambit.
S06E08,No One,106,- Would you? - Look around.
S06E08,No One,107,The city has come back to life.
S06E08,No One,108,You made a pact with fanatics.
S06E08,No One,109,I did and it worked.
S06E08,No One,110,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor,"
S06E08,No One,111,you'd say the razor worked.
S06E08,No One,112,That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.
S06E08,No One,113,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
S06E08,No One,114,I'm going to miss you.
S06E08,No One,115,I know.
S06E08,No One,116,I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
S06E08,No One,117,"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
S06E08,No One,118,We need friends in Westeros.
S06E08,No One,119,And we need ships.
S06E08,No One,120,"Most of all, we need our queen."
S06E08,No One,121,She'll come back. She has to.
S06E08,No One,122,My heart's been broken too many times already.
S06E08,No One,123,I'll walk the rest of the way myself.
S06E08,No One,124,I can't go off on a secret mission
S06E08,No One,125,in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
S06E08,No One,126,Varys.
S06E08,No One,127,The most famous dwarf in the world.
S06E08,No One,128,"Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant"
S06E08,No One,129,have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.
S06E08,No One,130,Have been permitted?
S06E08,No One,131,That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
S06E08,No One,132,"They demand to see you, Your Grace."
S06E08,No One,133,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
S06E08,No One,134,The king is aware of their presence?
S06E08,No One,135,"<i>He is, Your Grace.</i>"
S06E08,No One,136,He's currently in his chambers at prayer.
S06E08,No One,137,"Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon"
S06E08,No One,138,wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.
S06E08,No One,139,His Holiness the High Septon
S06E08,No One,140,is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
S06E08,No One,141,"Your Grace, this is not a request."
S06E08,No One,142,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel."
S06E08,No One,143,"You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
S06E08,No One,144,The High Septon commands you.
S06E08,No One,145,<i>Are you sure you want</i> <i>to refuse him?</i>
S06E08,No One,146,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
S06E08,No One,147,He made no such promises.
S06E08,No One,148,If you refuse to come of your own free will--
S06E08,No One,149,Get out.
S06E08,No One,150,"Move aside, ser."
S06E08,No One,151,Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
S06E08,No One,152,I choose violence.
S06E08,No One,153,Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
S06E08,No One,154,"Looks like a siege, my lady."
S06E08,No One,155,"You have a keen military mind, Pod."
S06E08,No One,156,My lady. My lady.
S06E08,No One,157,Who goes there?!
S06E08,No One,158,State your business!
S06E08,No One,159,My name is Brienne of Tarth.
S06E08,No One,160,Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.
S06E08,No One,161,Tell him I have his sword.
S06E08,No One,162,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
S06E08,No One,163,Podrick fucking Payne.
S06E08,No One,164,I thought you'd be dead by now.
S06E08,No One,165,Not yet.
S06E08,No One,166,- Are they in there? - Uh-huh.
S06E08,No One,167,You think they're fucking?
S06E08,No One,168,What?
S06E08,No One,169,No.
S06E08,No One,170,Why not? I'd fuck her.
S06E08,No One,171,"You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
S06E08,No One,172,- I'm her squire. - Oh.
S06E08,No One,173,"Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure."
S06E08,No One,174,"And she'd fuck him, don't you think?"
S06E08,No One,175,The way she looks at him.
S06E08,No One,176,The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.
S06E08,No One,177,I preferred working with the little brother on that account.
S06E08,No One,178,"Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
S06E08,No One,179,You must have shown it to her by now.
S06E08,No One,180,- She's training me to fight. - Is she?
S06E08,No One,181,Oh.
S06E08,No One,182,"An hour in the morning, an hour at night."
S06E08,No One,183,Every day.
S06E08,No One,184,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
S06E08,No One,185,"Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
S06E08,No One,186,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it?"
S06E08,No One,187,<i>You want to learn</i> <i>that sort of fighting?</i>
S06E08,No One,188,All right.
S06E08,No One,189,"All right, let's start with your footwork."
S06E08,No One,190,Show me your stance.
S06E08,No One,191,"Now listen to me, Pod."
S06E08,No One,192,See how your feet are about a yard apart?
S06E08,No One,193,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you."
S06E08,No One,194,"'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire."
S06E08,No One,195,"Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
S06E08,No One,196,<i>I never thought</i> <i>you'd find her.</i>
S06E08,No One,197,<i>I just assumed</i> <i>Sansa was dead.</i>
S06E08,No One,198,Why would you assume that?
S06E08,No One,199,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
S06E08,No One,200,I don't think you know many girls like her.
S06E08,No One,201,"Well, I'm proud of you."
S06E08,No One,202,<i>I am.</i>
S06E08,No One,203,<i>You fulfilled your oath</i> <i>to Catelyn Stark</i>
S06E08,No One,204,<i>against all odds.</i>
S06E08,No One,205,"Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead."
S06E08,No One,206,"The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,"
S06E08,No One,207,so there is that complication.
S06E08,No One,208,What the hell are you doing here?
S06E08,No One,209,I've come for the Blackfish.
S06E08,No One,210,You're welcome to have him.
S06E08,No One,211,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons
S06E08,No One,212,and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
S06E08,No One,213,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
S06E08,No One,214,The Tully army.
S06E08,No One,215,They're a bit occupied at the moment.
S06E08,No One,216,I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
S06E08,No One,217,"currently defended by the Tully rebels,"
S06E08,No One,218,so you can see the conundrum.
S06E08,No One,219,The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
S06E08,No One,220,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
S06E08,No One,221,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
S06E08,No One,222,Exactly.
S06E08,No One,223,We shouldn't argue about politics.
S06E08,No One,224,"You're a knight, Ser Jaime."
S06E08,No One,225,I know there is honor in you.
S06E08,No One,226,- I've seen it myself. - I'm a Lannister.
S06E08,No One,227,Don't ask me to betray my own house.
S06E08,No One,228,I do no such thing.
S06E08,No One,229,Take Riverrun without bloodshed.
S06E08,No One,230,Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.
S06E08,No One,231,What do you propose?
S06E08,No One,232,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.
S06E08,No One,233,Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
S06E08,No One,234,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
S06E08,No One,235,Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
S06E08,No One,236,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
S06E08,No One,237,No.
S06E08,No One,238,He's even more stubborn than you are.
S06E08,No One,239,All right.
S06E08,No One,240,Try to talk some sense into the old goat.
S06E08,No One,241,"He won't listen, but his men might."
S06E08,No One,242,Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.
S06E08,No One,243,I need your word.
S06E08,No One,244,"If I persuade him to abandon the castle,"
S06E08,No One,245,you'll grant a safe passage north.
S06E08,No One,246,You have my word.
S06E08,No One,247,You have until nightfall.
S06E08,No One,248,You gave it to me for a purpose.
S06E08,No One,249,I've achieved that purpose.
S06E08,No One,250,It's yours.
S06E08,No One,251,It will always be yours.
S06E08,No One,252,"One last thing, Ser Jaime."
S06E08,No One,253,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
S06E08,No One,254,Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender
S06E08,No One,255,"and if you attack the castle,"
S06E08,No One,256,honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.
S06E08,No One,257,Of course it does.
S06E08,No One,258,To fight you.
S06E08,No One,259,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
S06E08,No One,260,<i>I've said no</i> <i>three times already.</i>
S06E08,No One,261,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
S06E08,No One,262,I haven't seen her since she was a child.
S06E08,No One,263,I don't know her signature. I don't know you.
S06E08,No One,264,And I will not surrender. Double the guards tonight.
S06E08,No One,265,The Kingslayer wants to try us.
S06E08,No One,266,I can feel it.
S06E08,No One,267,"As I have said, my name is--"
S06E08,No One,268,"Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father."
S06E08,No One,269,- Good man. - He always spoke highly of you.
S06E08,No One,270,"And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
S06E08,No One,271,If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat
S06E08,No One,272,"on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
S06E08,No One,273,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
S06E08,No One,274,We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
S06E08,No One,275,- He's not my friend. - No?
S06E08,No One,276,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?
S06E08,No One,277,Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
S06E08,No One,278,Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.
S06E08,No One,279,"He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted."
S06E08,No One,280,He gave me this sword to protect her.
S06E08,No One,281,That is what I have done and I will continue to do
S06E08,No One,282,until the day I die.
S06E08,No One,283,She's exactly like her mother.
S06E08,No One,284,I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
S06E08,No One,285,You have more than she does.
S06E08,No One,286,She wants her home back. I understand that.
S06E08,No One,287,But this is my home.
S06E08,No One,288,"And if Jaime Lannister wants it,"
S06E08,No One,289,he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.
S06E08,No One,290,Find the maester.
S06E08,No One,291,We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
S06E08,No One,292,What should I write?
S06E08,No One,293,Tell her I failed.
S06E08,No One,294,There's to be a royal announcement?
S06E08,No One,295,There is.
S06E08,No One,296,Why wasn't I informed?
S06E08,No One,297,There is to be a royal announcement
S06E08,No One,298,in the throne room
S06E08,No One,299,at this very moment.
S06E08,No One,300,Where are you going?
S06E08,No One,301,To stand by my son.
S06E08,No One,302,Your place is in the gallery
S06E08,No One,303,with the other ladies of the court.
S06E08,No One,304,<i>Your Grace...</i>
S06E08,No One,305,"<i>Lords and ladies,</i>"
S06E08,No One,306,the Faith and the Crown
S06E08,No One,307,are the two pillars that hold up this world.
S06E08,No One,308,"One collapses, so does the other."
S06E08,No One,309,The Father judges us all.
S06E08,No One,310,If you break his laws...
S06E08,No One,311,<i>you will be punished.</i>
S06E08,No One,312,"After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon,"
S06E08,No One,313,we have determined that Loras Tyrell
S06E08,No One,314,and Cersei Lannister's trial
S06E08,No One,315,<i>will be held in</i> <i>the Great Sept of Baelor</i>
S06E08,No One,316,<i>on the first day</i> <i>of the Festival of the Mother.</i>
S06E08,No One,317,"Furthermore, after much prayer"
S06E08,No One,318,"<i>and reflection,</i>"
S06E08,No One,319,"the Crown has decided that from this day forward,"
S06E08,No One,320,trial by combat will be forbidden
S06E08,No One,321,throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
S06E08,No One,322,"<i>The tradition</i> <i>is a brutish one,</i>"
S06E08,No One,323,<i>a scheme devised</i> <i>by corrupt rulers</i>
S06E08,No One,324,<i>in order to avoid</i> <i>true judgment from the gods.</i>
S06E08,No One,325,<i>Cersei Lannister</i> <i>and Loras Tyrell</i>
S06E08,No One,326,will stand trial before seven septons
S06E08,No One,327,as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.
S06E08,No One,328,<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>
S06E08,No One,329,<i>Seven blessings.</i>
S06E08,No One,330,Your Grace...
S06E08,No One,331,that old rumor you told me about.
S06E08,No One,332,My little birds investigated.
S06E08,No One,333,And?
S06E08,No One,334,Was it just a rumor or something more?
S06E08,No One,335,More.
S06E08,No One,336,Much more.
S06E08,No One,337,<i>You seem happy.</i>
S06E08,No One,338,I am happy.
S06E08,No One,339,You should both be happy as well.
S06E08,No One,340,"Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
S06E08,No One,341,Now it's like a man reborn.
S06E08,No One,342,I will be happy when our queen returns.
S06E08,No One,343,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
S06E08,No One,344,Unsullied never drink.
S06E08,No One,345,- Why not? - Rules.
S06E08,No One,346,And who made these rules?
S06E08,No One,347,Your former masters?
S06E08,No One,348,<i>Those miserable old shits</i> <i>didn't want you to be human.</i>
S06E08,No One,349,Have a drink with me.
S06E08,No One,350,And you? What's your excuse?
S06E08,No One,351,I have tried wine before.
S06E08,No One,352,It made me feel funny.
S06E08,No One,353,That's how you know it's working.
S06E08,No One,354,Here's to our queen.
S06E08,No One,355,Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
S06E08,No One,356,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,"
S06E08,No One,357,"Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
S06E08,No One,358,- Long may she reign. - Long may she reign.
S06E08,No One,359,<i>Do you like it?</i>
S06E08,No One,360,Tastes like it has turned.
S06E08,No One,361,"Yes, yes. Fermentation."
S06E08,No One,362,"One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms..."
S06E08,No One,363,I'd like to have my own vineyard.
S06E08,No One,364,Make my own wine.
S06E08,No One,365,The Imp's Delight.
S06E08,No One,366,Only my close friends could drink it.
S06E08,No One,367,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
S06E08,No One,368,I do not know any jokes.
S06E08,No One,369,Grey Worm?
S06E08,No One,370,Right.
S06E08,No One,371,Three lords walk into a tavern--
S06E08,No One,372,"a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister."
S06E08,No One,373,"<i>They order ale,</i>"
S06E08,No One,374,"but when the barkeep brings them over,"
S06E08,No One,375,each of them finds a fly in his cup.
S06E08,No One,376,"The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another."
S06E08,No One,377,The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.
S06E08,No One,378,"The Stark reaches into his cup,"
S06E08,No One,379,"pulls out the fly and shouts,"
S06E08,No One,380,"""Spit it out, you wee shit."
S06E08,No One,381,"Spit it out."""
S06E08,No One,382,It's funnier in Westeros.
S06E08,No One,383,"The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies."
S06E08,No One,384,Yes.
S06E08,No One,385,"A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho."
S06E08,No One,386,"Not a true story, necessarily."
S06E08,No One,387,A story that's supposed to make you laugh ideally.
S06E08,No One,388,"<i>Not at the moment,</i> <i>perhaps.</i>"
S06E08,No One,389,"<i>Missandei,</i> <i>do you like the wine?</i>"
S06E08,No One,390,I do.
S06E08,No One,391,Tell a joke.
S06E08,No One,392,Two translators are on a sinking ship.
S06E08,No One,393,"The first says,"
S06E08,No One,394,"""Do you know how to swim?"""
S06E08,No One,395,"The second says, ""No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages."""
S06E08,No One,396,Ah!
S06E08,No One,397,That is the worst joke I ever heard.
S06E08,No One,398,You don't even know what a joke is.
S06E08,No One,399,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
S06E08,No One,400,You lied to us.
S06E08,No One,401,I make joke.
S06E08,No One,402,More jokes.
S06E08,No One,403,I once walked into a brothel
S06E08,No One,404,with a honeycomb and a jackass.
S06E08,No One,405,The madam says--
S06E08,No One,406,The Masters have come for their property.
S06E08,No One,407,Lord Edmure.
S06E08,No One,408,<i>I apologize for the way</i> <i>the Freys treated you.</i>
S06E08,No One,409,A man of your birth deserves better.
S06E08,No One,410,You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on.
S06E08,No One,411,I have your word?
S06E08,No One,412,"Oh, good."
S06E08,No One,413,"Good, that's--"
S06E08,No One,414,that's a fine thing.
S06E08,No One,415,"My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser."
S06E08,No One,416,Whatever game you're playing.
S06E08,No One,417,The Blackfish is an old man.
S06E08,No One,418,A good death is all he can hope for.
S06E08,No One,419,"But you, you have a child now, I've heard."
S06E08,No One,420,A son you sired on your wedding night.
S06E08,No One,421,You're a potent man.
S06E08,No One,422,A son I've never met
S06E08,No One,423,born of a wife that I haven't seen
S06E08,No One,424,since our first night together.
S06E08,No One,425,You should be with them both.
S06E08,No One,426,"I can arrange that, you realize?"
S06E08,No One,427,Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.
S06E08,No One,428,"A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride."
S06E08,No One,429,"And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
S06E08,No One,430,Do you imagine yourself a decent person?
S06E08,No One,431,Is that it?
S06E08,No One,432,After you've massacred my family.
S06E08,No One,433,Kept me in a cell for years.
S06E08,No One,434,Stolen our lands.
S06E08,No One,435,I'll remind you that our houses are at war.
S06E08,No One,436,"I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you,"
S06E08,No One,437,but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.
S06E08,No One,438,Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
S06E08,No One,439,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation?
S06E08,No One,440,It's not.
S06E08,No One,441,You understand. On some level you understand
S06E08,No One,442,that you're an evil man.
S06E08,No One,443,I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
S06E08,No One,444,"Well, that is convenient for you."
S06E08,No One,445,"You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
S06E08,No One,446,"Your square jaw,"
S06E08,No One,447,your golden armor.
S06E08,No One,448,"Tell me, I want to know."
S06E08,No One,449,I truly do.
S06E08,No One,450,How do you live with yourself?
S06E08,No One,451,All of us have to believe
S06E08,No One,452,"that we're decent, don't we?"
S06E08,No One,453,You have to sleep at night.
S06E08,No One,454,How do you tell yourself
S06E08,No One,455,that you're decent
S06E08,No One,456,after everything that you've done?
S06E08,No One,457,I was your sister's prisoner once.
S06E08,No One,458,She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
S06E08,No One,459,Yeah.
S06E08,No One,460,She should have killed you.
S06E08,No One,461,"Perhaps, but she didn't."
S06E08,No One,462,Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.
S06E08,No One,463,<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>
S06E08,No One,464,I admired her.
S06E08,No One,465,Far more than her husband or her son.
S06E08,No One,466,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?
S06E08,No One,467,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner."
S06E08,No One,468,You don't have a choice.
S06E08,No One,469,"The love she had for her children,"
S06E08,No One,470,I was a little awed by it.
S06E08,No One,471,Reminded me of my sister.
S06E08,No One,472,"Oh. Oh, I see."
S06E08,No One,473,You're a madman.
S06E08,No One,474,I'm not here to trade insults.
S06E08,No One,475,- Your sister was a strong-- - Don't talk about Cat!
S06E08,No One,476,I'll talk about whomever I want.
S06E08,No One,477,She loved her children.
S06E08,No One,478,"I suppose all mothers do,"
S06E08,No One,479,"but Catelyn and Cersei,"
S06E08,No One,480,there's a fierceness you don't often see.
S06E08,No One,481,They'd do anything to protect their babies.
S06E08,No One,482,Start a war.
S06E08,No One,483,Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies.
S06E08,No One,484,The things we do for love.
S06E08,No One,485,You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
S06E08,No One,486,That's exactly why I came here.
S06E08,No One,487,I love Cersei.
S06E08,No One,488,You can laugh at that if you want.
S06E08,No One,489,You can sneer. Doesn't matter.
S06E08,No One,490,She needs me.
S06E08,No One,491,"And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun."
S06E08,No One,492,I'll send for your baby boy.
S06E08,No One,493,And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult.
S06E08,No One,494,"Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure."
S06E08,No One,495,Your son doesn't matter to me.
S06E08,No One,496,The people in the castle don't matter to me.
S06E08,No One,497,Only Cersei.
S06E08,No One,498,And if I have to slaughter every Tully
S06E08,No One,499,"who ever lived to get back to her,"
S06E08,No One,500,that's what I'll do.
S06E08,No One,501,<i>Who goes there?</i>
S06E08,No One,502,"Edmure Tully,"
S06E08,No One,503,son of Hoster Tully
S06E08,No One,504,and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.
S06E08,No One,505,I demand entry.
S06E08,No One,506,Don't let him in.
S06E08,No One,507,He's the Lord of Riverrun.
S06E08,No One,508,I have to obey his commands.
S06E08,No One,509,He's been their captive
S06E08,No One,510,ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.
S06E08,No One,511,Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding
S06E08,No One,512,would decide to let him come home?
S06E08,No One,513,"Because it's a trap, you idiot."
S06E08,No One,514,Don't let him in.
S06E08,No One,515,"He's my lord, my lord."
S06E08,No One,516,I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.
S06E08,No One,517,You're not obeying Edmure's commands.
S06E08,No One,518,You're obeying the fucking Kingslayer's commands.
S06E08,No One,519,<i>I demand entry.</i>
S06E08,No One,520,My lord has given an order.
S06E08,No One,521,With a knife to his throat.
S06E08,No One,522,That is not a valid order.
S06E08,No One,523,Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed--
S06E08,No One,524,"Aye, ser."
S06E08,No One,525,I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
S06E08,No One,526,"You are not lord of this castle, my lord."
S06E08,No One,527,"- Lower the drawbridge. <i>- Aye, ser!</i>"
S06E08,No One,528,"<i>If you're wrong,</i>"
S06E08,No One,529,we've just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.
S06E08,No One,530,"Welcome home, my lord."
S06E08,No One,531,Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms.
S06E08,No One,532,Open the gates.
S06E08,No One,533,- My lord-- - Your lord has given a command.
S06E08,No One,534,"<i>Infantry, advance!</i>"
S06E08,No One,535,Find the Blackfish.
S06E08,No One,536,Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
S06E08,No One,537,Find him.
S06E08,No One,538,Go on.
S06E08,No One,539,Come with us.
S06E08,No One,540,I've run before from the Red Wedding.
S06E08,No One,541,I'm not running again. This is my family home.
S06E08,No One,542,Your family is in the North. Come with us.
S06E08,No One,543,Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
S06E08,No One,544,You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
S06E08,No One,545,<i>All the way down!</i>
S06E08,No One,546,"- <i>Check that out!</i> - Go on, now."
S06E08,No One,547,I haven't had a proper sword fight in years.
S06E08,No One,548,I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
S06E08,No One,549,"We found the Blackfish, my lord."
S06E08,No One,550,Good.
S06E08,No One,551,Bring him to me.
S06E08,No One,552,"He died fighting, my lord."
S06E08,No One,553,- I was wrong. I admit it. - That changes nothing.
S06E08,No One,554,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead.
S06E08,No One,555,If the slavers' forces--
S06E08,No One,556,No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
S06E08,No One,557,And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying--
S06E08,No One,558,You're trying to tell me what the army should do.
S06E08,No One,559,<i>You do not know</i> <i>what the army should do.</i>
S06E08,No One,560,"All right, what should the army do?"
S06E08,No One,561,We'll not go to the beach.
S06E08,No One,562,"If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid."
S06E08,No One,563,The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend.
S06E08,No One,564,- We stay here. - And then?
S06E08,No One,565,We wait for them to come to us.
S06E08,No One,566,Then we fight them.
S06E08,No One,567,Clegane.
S06E08,No One,568,What the fuck you doing here?
S06E08,No One,569,Chasing them. You?
S06E08,No One,570,Hanging them.
S06E08,No One,571,Any particular reason?
S06E08,No One,572,They're our men. Or they were.
S06E08,No One,573,They attacked a nearby Sept and murdered the villagers.
S06E08,No One,574,<i>Why do you want them?</i>
S06E08,No One,575,Same reason.
S06E08,No One,576,I was helping build it.
S06E08,No One,577,<i>They killed</i> <i>a friend of mine.</i>
S06E08,No One,578,You've got friends?
S06E08,No One,579,Not anymore. They're mine.
S06E08,No One,580,It's the Brotherhood's good name they've dragged through the dirt.
S06E08,No One,581,Fuck your name. They're mine.
S06E08,No One,582,"I killed you once before, Dondarrion."
S06E08,No One,583,Happy to do it again.
S06E08,No One,584,"Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
S06E08,No One,585,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
S06E08,No One,586,You can have one of them.
S06E08,No One,587,Two.
S06E08,No One,588,"No, no, no."
S06E08,No One,589,We're not butchers. We hang them.
S06E08,No One,590,Hanging?
S06E08,No One,591,All over in an instant.
S06E08,No One,592,Where's the punishment in that?
S06E08,No One,593,- They die. - We all bloody die.
S06E08,No One,594,Except this one here.
S06E08,No One,595,I'll only gut one of them.
S06E08,No One,596,<i>No.</i>
S06E08,No One,597,I'll chop off one hand.
S06E08,No One,598,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.
S06E08,No One,599,That's generous.
S06E08,No One,600,Bunch of nancies.
S06E08,No One,601,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you
S06E08,No One,602,just to gut these three.
S06E08,No One,603,"You're getting old, Clegane."
S06E08,No One,604,He's not.
S06E08,No One,605,Please don't. I'll give you anything.
S06E08,No One,606,Got anything to eat?
S06E08,No One,607,Enjoying yourself?
S06E08,No One,608,I prefer chicken.
S06E08,No One,609,You ought to join us. We could use you.
S06E08,No One,610,I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
S06E08,No One,611,"Clegane, we're here for a reason."
S06E08,No One,612,The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason.
S06E08,No One,613,"He gave a failed, drunk priest"
S06E08,No One,614,the power to bring him back for a reason.
S06E08,No One,615,We are part of something larger than ourselves.
S06E08,No One,616,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done
S06E08,No One,617,for something larger than ourselves.
S06E08,No One,618,Cold winds are rising in the North.
S06E08,No One,619,And you're going to go stop them?
S06E08,No One,620,We need good men to help us.
S06E08,No One,621,"Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
S06E08,No One,622,<i>True enough.</i>
S06E08,No One,623,But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me.
S06E08,No One,624,Why?
S06E08,No One,625,"I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric."
S06E08,No One,626,I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord
S06E08,No One,627,and I'm better than you now.
S06E08,No One,628,"Aye, you're probably right."
S06E08,No One,629,You're a fighter.
S06E08,No One,630,You were born a fighter.
S06E08,No One,631,You walked away from the fight.
S06E08,No One,632,How did that go?
S06E08,No One,633,"Good and bad, young and old,"
S06E08,No One,634,the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.
S06E08,No One,635,"<i>You can still help a lot more</i> <i>than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>"
S06E08,No One,636,It's not too late for you.
S06E08,No One,637,Lady Crane?
S06E08,No One,638,<i>Lady Crane?</i>
S06E08,No One,639,"If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
S06E08,No One,640,Instead...
S06E08,No One,641,The Many-Faced God was promised a name.
S06E08,No One,642,He must always receive what is his.
S06E08,No One,643,You can't change that.
S06E08,No One,644,I can't change that.
S06E08,No One,645,No one can.
S06E08,No One,646,And now he's been promised another name.
S06E08,No One,647,- Hey! - Get out!
S06E08,No One,648,Yah!
S06E08,No One,649,Hey!
S06E08,No One,650,Yah!
S06E08,No One,651,Ah!
S06E08,No One,652,My basket!
S06E08,No One,653,It will all be over soon.
S06E08,No One,654,On your knees or on your feet?
S06E08,No One,655,Haven't we been through this already?
S06E08,No One,656,That won't help you.
S06E08,No One,657,You told her to kill me.
S06E08,No One,658,Yes.
S06E08,No One,659,<i>But here you are.</i>
S06E08,No One,660,And there she is.
S06E08,No One,661,Finally a girl is no one.
S06E08,No One,662,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell
S06E08,No One,663,and I'm going home.
S06E08,No One,664,"== sync, corrected by <font color=""#00FF00"">elderman</font> == <font color=""#00FFFF"">@elder_man</font>"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,1,"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,2,Perhaps we should take shelter.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,3,The city's on the rise?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,4,Meereen is strong.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,5,Commerce has returned to the markets.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,6,The people are behind you.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,7,"Well, not all the people, of course."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,8,No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,9,But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,10,The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,11,"Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,12,a city without Masters...
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,13,...it proves that no one needs a Master.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,14,Good.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,15,Shall we begin?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,16,Do we have a plan?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,17,I will crucify the Masters.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,18,"I will set their fleets afire,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,19,"kill every last one of their soldiers,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,20,and return their cities to the dirt.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,21,That is my plan.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,22,You don't approve?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,23,You once told me you knew what your father was.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,24,Did you know his plans for King's Landing
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,25,when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,26,Probably not.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,27,"Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,28,"He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,29,"the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,30,all the major thoroughfares.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,31,He would have burned every one of his citizens.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,32,The loyal ones and the traitors.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,33,"Every man, woman, and child."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,34,That's why Jaime killed him.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,35,This is entirely different.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,36,You're talking about destroying cities.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,37,It's not entirely different.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,38,I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,39,"Once before, I offered you peace."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,40,"If you had not been so arrogant,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,41,you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,42,"Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,43,like the beggar queen you are.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,44,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,45,not to trade insults.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,46,The terms are simple.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,47,You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,48,The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,49,will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,50,The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,51,to be sold again to the highest bidder.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,52,The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,53,We obviously didn't communicate clearly.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,54,"We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,55,I imagine it's difficult
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,56,adjusting to the new reality.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,57,Your reign is over.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,58,My reign has just begun.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,59,Dracarys.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,60,Your men have a choice:
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,61,"fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,62,or go home to your families.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,63,Thank you for the armada.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,64,Our queen does love ships.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,65,"Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,66,You violated that pact.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,67,You declared war upon us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,68,"Though our queen does have a forgiving nature,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,69,this cannot be forgiven.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,70,Our queen insists that one of you must die
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,71,as punishment for your crimes.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,72,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,73,other people dying?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,74,Him. He should die.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,75,"Yes, him. He's not one of us."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,76,"He's an outsider, a lowborn."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,77,He does not speak for us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,78,Please.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,79,Please.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,80,Tell your people what happened here.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,81,Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,82,When they come forward with notions of retribution
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,83,"or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,84,remind them what happened
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,85,when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,86,You don't have to be here.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,87,"Yes, I do."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,88,My beloved wife.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,89,I've missed you terribly.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,90,Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,91,"Now, dismount and kneel before me,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,92,surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,93,I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,94,I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,95,"Come, bastard,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,96,"you don't have the men, you don't have the horses,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,97,and you don't have Winterfell.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,98,Why lead those poor souls into slaughter?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,99,There's no need for a battle.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,100,Get off your horse and kneel.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,101,I'm a man of mercy.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,102,You're right.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,103,There's no need for a battle.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,104,Thousands of men don't need to die.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,105,Only one of us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,106,Let's end this the old way.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,107,You against me.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,108,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,109,"The way people in the North talk about you,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,110,you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,111,Maybe you are that good.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,112,Maybe not.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,113,I don't know if I'd beat you.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,114,But I know that my army will beat yours.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,115,"I have 6,000 men."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,116,"You have, what, half that?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,117,Not even?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,118,"Aye, you have the numbers."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,119,Will your men want to fight for you
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,120,when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,121,He's good. Very good.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,122,"Tell me, will you let your little brother die"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,123,because you're too proud to surrender?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,124,How do we know you have him?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,125,"Now, if you want to save..."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,126,"You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,127,Sleep well.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,128,"She's a fine woman, your sister."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,129,I look forward to having her back in my bed.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,130,And you're all fine-looking men.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,131,My dogs are desperate to meet you.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,132,I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,133,I wonder which parts they'll try first.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,134,Your eyes?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,135,Your balls?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,136,We'll find out soon enough.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,137,"In the morning, then, bastard."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,138,"If he was smart, he'd stay inside"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,139,the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,140,That's not his way. He knows the North is watching.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,141,"If the other houses sense weakness on his part,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,142,they'll stop fearing him.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,143,He can't have that. Fear is his power.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,144,"It's his weakness, too. His men don't want to fight for him."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,145,They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,146,It's not his men that worry me.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,147,It's his horses.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,148,I know what mounted knights can do to us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,149,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,150,We're digging trenches all along our flanks.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,151,"They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,152,in a double envelopment.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,153,A pincer move.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,154,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,155,Good.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,156,It's crucial that we let them charge at us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,157,"They've got the numbers, we need the patience."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,158,"If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,159,Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,160,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man-to-man?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,161,No.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,162,But I wanted to make him angry.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,163,I want him coming at us full tilt.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,164,We should all get some sleep.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,165,"Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,166,"So you've met the enemy,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,167,drawn up your battle plans.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,168,"Aye, for what they're worth."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,169,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,170,"you and your trusted advisors,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,171,and you sit around making your plans
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,172,on how to defeat a man you don't know.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,173,I lived with him.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,174,I know the way his mind works.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,175,I know how he likes to hurt people.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,176,Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,177,You're right.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,178,You think he's going to fall into your trap.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,179,He won't. He's the one who lays traps.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,180,- He's overconfident. - He plays with people.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,181,He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,182,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,183,I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,184,I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,185,You don't know him.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,186,"All right, tell me."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,187,What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,188,We'll never get him back.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,189,"Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,190,which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,191,"than you, a bastard, or me, a girl."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,192,"As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,193,which means he won't live long.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,194,We can't give up on our brother.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,195,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,196,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,197,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,198,Just don't do what he wants you to do.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,199,"Aye, that's good advice."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,200,You think that's obvious?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,201,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,202,"If you had asked for my advice earlier,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,203,I would have told you not to attack Winterfell
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,204,"until we had a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,205,When will we have a larger force?!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,206,We've pleaded with every house that'll have us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,207,The Blackfish can't help us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,208,We're lucky to have this many men.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,209,"- It's not enough! - No, it's not enough. It's what we have!"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,210,Battles have been won against greater odds.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,211,"If Ramsay wins,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,212,I'm not going back there alive.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,213,Do you understand me?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,214,I won't let ever let him touch you again.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,215,"I'll protect you, I promise."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,216,No one can protect me.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,217,No one can protect anyone.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,218,You think there's hope?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,219,I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,220,"And they've never seen the free folk fight,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,221,"so, yes, there's hope."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,222,"You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,223,It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,224,It was Stannis himself.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,225,I loved the man.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,226,He lifted me up and made me something.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,227,But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,228,- You saw these demons? - What?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,229,"No, it's a manner of speaking."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,230,Not... actual demons.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,231,"Well, you loved that cunt Stannis"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,232,and I loved the man he burned.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,233,Mance didn't have demons in his skull.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,234,He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,235,I believed in him.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,236,I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,237,But I was wrong just like you.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,238,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,239,Jon Snow's not a king.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,240,"No, he's not."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,241,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,242,You want some?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,243,I have a jug of sour goat's milk
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,244,stronger than any of that grape water
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,245,you southern twats like sucking on.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,246,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,247,but I better keep a clear head.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,248,I can never sleep the night before a battle.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,249,So what do you do all night?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,250,I walk.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,251,Think and walk.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,252,Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,253,that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,254,Happy shitting.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,255,My lady.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,256,You weren't at the war council.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,257,I'm not a soldier.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,258,Any advice?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,259,Don't lose.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,260,"If I do, if I fall..."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,261,don't bring me back.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,262,I'll have to try.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,263,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,264,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,265,You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,266,I serve the Lord of Light.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,267,I do what he commands.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,268,How do you know what he commands?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,269,I interpret his signs...
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,270,as well as I can.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,271,"If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,272,how did I bring you back?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,273,I have no power.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,274,Only what he gives me and he gave me you.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,275,Why?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,276,I don't know.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,277,Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,278,Maybe he brought you here to die again.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,279,What kind of god would do something like that?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,280,The one we've got.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,281,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,282,"You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,283,Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,284,thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,285,"""The height of nobility,"" ""a man of your stature,"""
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,286,"""someone to look up to."""
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,287,You're all making the same five or six jokes.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,288,- It was a long time ago. - It was.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,289,And how have things been going for you since then?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,290,"Not so well, I gather."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,291,Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,292,I didn't murder the Stark boys.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,293,But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,294,And he paid for them.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,295,Doesn't seem like it.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,296,He's still alive.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,297,"It was complicated for you, I'm sure,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,298,growing up at Winterfell.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,299,Never quite knowing who you were.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,300,"But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,301,You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,302,with men to sail them.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,303,"In return, I expect you want me to support"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,304,your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,305,Not my claim. Hers.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,306,And what's wrong with you?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,307,I'm not fit to rule.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,308,We can agree upon that at least.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,309,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,310,No more than Westeros.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,311,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,312,He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,313,He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,314,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,315,You and I have that in common.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,316,We do.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,317,And both murdered by a usurper as well.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,318,Will their ships be enough?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,319,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,320,Barely.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,321,There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,322,There are and Euron is building more.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,323,He's going to offer them to you.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,324,So why shouldn't I wait for him?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,325,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,326,He also wants to give you...
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,327,"His big cock, I think he said."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,328,"Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,329,You won't get one without the other.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,330,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,331,"I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,332,He murdered our father and would have murdered us.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,333,He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,334,The Seven Kingdoms.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,335,All of them.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,336,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,337,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,338,We ask you to give them back.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,339,And that's all?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,340,We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,341,who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,342,Reasonable.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,343,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,344,"She's not demanding, she's asking."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,345,The others are free to ask as well.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,346,"Our fathers were evil men, all of us here."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,347,They left the world worse than they found it.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,348,We're not going to do that.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,349,We're going to leave the world better than we found it.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,350,You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,351,and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,352,"No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,353,That's our way of life.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,354,No more.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,355,No more.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,356,"Do you like games, little man?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,357,Let's play a game.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,358,Run to your brother.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,359,"The sooner you make it to him,"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,360,the sooner you get to see him again.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,361,That's it.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,362,That's the game.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,363,Easy.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,364,Ready?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,365,Go.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,366,"No, you have to run, remember?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,367,Those are the rules.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,368,`T`U`S`U`B`T`I`T`U`L`O`C`O`M
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,369,Don't.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,370,Prepare to charge.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,371,Prepare to charge!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,372,- Draw! - Draw!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,373,Draw!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,374,Loose!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,375,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,376,Run and fight!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,377,Nock!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,378,- Draw! - Draw!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,379,- Loose! - Loose!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,380,Now.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,381,"Cavalry, charge!"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,382,- Nock! - Nock!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,383,- Nock! - Nock!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,384,- Draw! - Draw!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,385,- Draw! - Draw!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,386,We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,387,- Loose! - Loose!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,388,Get word...
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,389,No!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,390,Loose!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,391,- Loose! - Loose!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,392,- Loose! - Loose!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,393,We may as well be taking shits back here.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,394,Follow!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,395,"It's time, go."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,396,- Who owns the North? - We do!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,397,- Who owns the North? - We do!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,398,Show me!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,399,Hey!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,400,"Infantry, advance!"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,401,"With me, lads! Break their line!"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,402,Help me!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,403,- Tormund! - Get him back!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,404,"Infantry, advance."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,405,Both sides!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,406,Fall back!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,407,Fall back!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,408,"Fuck this, come on!"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,409,We're going home!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,410,Open the gate!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,411,Archers to the wall.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,412,- Their army's gone. - Our army's gone.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,413,We have Winterfell.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,414,They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,415,Archers!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,416,To the wall!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,417,"You suggested one-on-one combat, didn't you?"
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,418,I've reconsidered.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,419,I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,420,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,421,next to my father.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,422,Jon.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,423,Where is he?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,424,Sansa.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,425,"Hello, Sansa."
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,426,Is this where I'll be staying now?
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,427,No.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,428,Our time together is about to come to an end.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,429,That's all right.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,430,You can't kill me.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,431,I'm part of you now.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,432,Your words will disappear.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,433,Your house will disappear.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,434,Your name will disappear.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,435,All memory of you will disappear.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,436,My hounds will never harm me.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,437,You haven't fed them in seven days.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,438,You said it yourself.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,439,They're loyal beasts.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,440,They were.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,441,Now they're starving.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,442,Sit.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,443,Down.
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,444,Down!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,445,Down! Down!
S06E09,Battle of the Bastards,446,Down!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,1,Your Grace.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,2,The trial will be getting under way soon.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,3,You got my money?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,4,Later. Go away.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,5,Grand Maester.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,6,Ser Loras Tyrell.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,7,Are you prepared to stand trial
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,8,and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,9,There'll be no need for a trial.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,10,I confess before the Seven
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,11,and freely admit to my crimes.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,12,To which crimes will you be confessing?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,13,All of them.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,14,I lay with other men
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,15,including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,16,I perjured myself before the gods.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,17,I am guilty of depravity...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,18,"dishonesty,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,19,"profligacy,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,20,and arrogance.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,21,I see that now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,22,I humble myself before the Seven
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,23,and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,24,"The gods' judgment is fierce,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,25,but also fair.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,26,The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,27,beyond the reach of justice.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,28,But the Mother shows her mercy
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,29,to those who kneel before her.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,30,I take full responsibility for my many sins
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,31,and unburden myself of my desires.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,32,My only remaining wish
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,33,is to devote my life to the Seven.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,34,May I be a living example of their grace
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,35,for others to witness.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,36,You understand fully
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,37,what this means?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,38,I do.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,39,I will abandon the Tyrell name
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,40,and all that goes with it.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,41,I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,42,I will never marry
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,43,and I will never father children.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,44,Brother Loras...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,45,...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,46,Will you fight to defend your faith
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,47,against heretics and apostates?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,48,I will.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,49,"No, I can't let them..."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,50,"Faith is the way, Father."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,51,All right.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,52,I'm ready.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,53,I have to go. I'm...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,54,I'm late for the trial.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,55,You mutilated him.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,56,You gave me your word.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,57,And I have kept my word.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,58,"Once the queen mother's trial is concluded,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,59,Brother Loras is free to leave.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,60,And where is the queen mother?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,61,Her litter never left the Red Keep.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,62,It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,63,Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,64,Get the others.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,65,Where's the king?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,66,"Elsewhere, I'm afraid."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,67,What's the meaning of this?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,68,I was told that...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,69,I have more important things to do with my time
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,70,than waste them in the presence...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,71,"Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,72,Please forgive me if you can.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,73,"This pains me, my lord."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,74,"Whatever your faults, you do not deserve"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,75,"to die alone in such a cold, dark place."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,76,"But sometimes before we can usher in the new,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,77,the old must be put to rest.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,78,"The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,79,What are you doing?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,80,There's something wrong.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,81,"You have nothing to fear, Your Grace."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,82,The trial will begin shortly.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,83,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,84,Why do you think they're not here?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,85,"If the accused is not here,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,86,she will be tried regardless.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,87,We cannot escape the justice of the gods...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,88,Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,89,Cersei understands the consequences of her absence
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,90,"and she is absent anyway,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,91,which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,92,The trial can wait. We all need to leave.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,93,We all need to leave now!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,94,Loras.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,95,Stay with me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,96,Let me through. Let me through.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,97,Get out of my way.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,98,Let us through.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,99,Confess.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,100,Confess.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,101,- No. - Confess.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,102,Confess. It felt good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,103,"Beating me, starving me,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,104,"frightening me, humiliating me."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,105,You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,106,You did it because it felt good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,107,I understand.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,108,I do things because they feel good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,109,I drink because it feels good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,110,I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,111,I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,112,I lie about fucking my brother...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,113,because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,114,I killed your High Sparrow...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,115,and all his little sparrows...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,116,"all his septons, all his septas,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,117,"all his filthy soldiers,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,118,because it felt good to watch them burn.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,119,It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,120,No thought has ever given me greater joy.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,121,Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,122,You've always been quiet.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,123,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,124,Do you remember?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,125,Good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,126,I'm glad to see your face.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,127,I'm ready to meet the gods.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,128,What?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,129,Now?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,130,Today?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,131,You're not going to die today.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,132,You're not going to die for quite a while.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,133,Ser Gregor.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,134,This is Ser Gregor Clegane.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,135,"He's quiet, too."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,136,Your gods have forsaken you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,137,This is your god now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,138,No.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,139,No.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,140,Shame.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,141,Shame.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,142,Shame.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,143,"I'm very sorry, Your Grace."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,144,Very sorry.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,145,For House Lannister!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,146,Hear me roar!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,147,For House Frey!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,148,We stand together!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,149,"May we stand together through the centuries,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,150,good friends to the last.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,151,"And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,152,"may we speak the words of our alliance,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,153,"""The Freys and the Lannisters"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,154,"send their regards."""
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,155,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,156,"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,157,and all the birds come pecking.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,158,- You're welcome to her. - She doesn't want me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,159,She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,160,Those two have their eyes on you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,161,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,162,Not my type.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,163,Not blonde enough?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,164,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,165,hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,166,- There you go. - Maybe I'm not in the mood.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,167,Fuck it.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,168,No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,169,This came together rather well.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,170,Your father would be pleased.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,171,I'm sure he would be.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,172,Edmure is back in a cell.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,173,Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,174,Give the family a bad name.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,175,"So the famous Blackfish killed by foot soldiers, eh?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,176,"Legendary warrior, everyone said."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,177,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,178,I'm a bit old for all that.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,179,"No, but back in your day."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,180,The purpose of fighting
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,181,"is defeating your enemies, isn't it?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,182,I've defeated mine.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,183,Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,184,Now it's mine.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,185,What do you call that?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,186,Victory.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,187,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,188,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,189,The Tullys mocked me for years.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,190,The Starks mocked me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,191,Where are they now?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,192,"You talk about war as if you're an expert,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,193,"but the one battle I remember you fighting,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,194,"you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,195,But it doesn't matter.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,196,"Here we are now, two kingslayers."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,197,We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,198,and snigger behind our backs.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,199,"We don't mind, do we?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,200,Fear is a marvelous thing.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,201,"They don't fear the Freys, though."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,202,They fear the Lannisters.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,203,We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,204,If we have to ride north and take them back for you
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,205,"every time you lose them,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,206,why do we need you?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,207,Show me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,208,"Your Grace, there's no need..."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,209,Show me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,210,What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,211,"As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,212,perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,213,"He should be with his grandfather,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,214,"his brother, his sister."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,215,Burn him
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,216,and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,217,Hello.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,218,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,219,I'm...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,220,I'm to be the new maester.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,221,"According to our records,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,222,Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,223,He died.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,224,We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,225,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,226,He's since passed away.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,227,"Jon Snow will go to ""T|U|S|U|B|T|I|T|U|L|O|""."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,228,Which is why I'm here.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,229,This is irregular.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,230,"Yes, well..."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,231,I suppose that life is irregular.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,232,The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,233,"In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,234,Follow me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,235,No women or children.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,236,"When we had feasts,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,237,our family would sit up here...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,238,and I'd sit down there.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,239,"Could have been worse, Jon Snow."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,240,You had a family.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,241,You had feasts.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,242,"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,243,What is that?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,244,Tell him.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,245,Tell him who it belonged to.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,246,The Princess Shireen.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,247,Tell him what you did to her.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,248,Tell him!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,249,We burned her at the stake.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,250,Why?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,251,The army was trapped. The horses were dying.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,252,- It was the only way. - You burned a little girl alive!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,253,I only do what my Lord commands.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,254,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,255,We are standing here because of him.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,256,Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,257,I loved that girl like she was my own.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,258,She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,259,So did her father.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,260,So did her mother.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,261,Her own blood knew it was the only way.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,262,The only way for what?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,263,They all died anyway.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,264,You told everyone Stannis was the one.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,265,"You had him believing it, all of them fooled."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,266,- And you lied. - I didn't lie.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,267,I was wrong.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,268,"Aye, you were wrong."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,269,How many died because you were wrong?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,270,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,271,She admits to the crime.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,272,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,273,I've been ready to die for many years.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,274,"If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,275,"You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,276,You know the great war is still to come.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,277,You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,278,And you know I can help you win that war.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,279,Ride south today.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,280,"If you return to the North,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,281,I'll have you hanged as a murderer.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,282,"If you ever come back this way,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,283,I will execute you myself.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,284,I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,285,Mother and Father's room?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,286,You should take it.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,287,I'm not a Stark.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,288,You are to me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,289,You're the Lady of Winterfell.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,290,You deserve it. We're standing here because of you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,291,The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,292,They came because of you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,293,You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,294,- He did. - And you trust him?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,295,Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,296,"I should have told you about him,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,297,about the Knights of the Vale.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,298,I'm sorry.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,299,We need to trust each other.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,300,We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,301,We have so many enemies now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,302,Jon.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,303,A raven came from the Citadel.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,304,A white raven.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,305,Winter is here.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,306,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,307,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,308,he was assassinated.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,309,"100 red scorpions, was it?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,310,"You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,311,"You murder your own prince,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,312,but you expect me to trust you?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,313,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,314,You came to Dorne because you needed our help.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,315,What is your name again?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,316,Barbaro?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,317,Obara.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,318,Obara. You look like an angry little boy.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,319,Don't presume to tell me what I need.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,320,"Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes..."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,321,"Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,322,No? Good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,323,Let the grown women speak.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,324,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,325,They have declared war on Dorne.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,326,We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,327,Cersei stole the future from me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,328,She killed my son.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,329,She killed my grandson.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,330,She killed my granddaughter.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,331,Survival is not what I'm after now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,332,You're absolutely right.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,333,I chose the wrong words.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,334,It is not survival I offer.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,335,It is your heart's desire.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,336,And what is my heart's desire?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,337,Vengeance.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,338,Justice.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,339,Fire and blood.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,340,Your ships are nearly ready.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,341,I saw them painting the sails.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,342,I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,343,You're not coming with us.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,344,New strategy?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,345,You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,346,"If we take Casterly Rock,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,347,the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,348,You're not going to Westeros.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,349,You're staying here with the Second Sons.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,350,There's finally peace in Meereen.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,351,You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,352,Fuck Meereen.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,353,Fuck the people.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,354,"I'm here for you, not them."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,355,You promised me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,356,"""My sword is yours. My life is yours."""
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,357,This is what I command.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,358,"If I'm going to rule in Westeros,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,359,I'll need to make alliances.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,360,The best way to make alliances is with marriage.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,361,Who are you marrying this time?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,362,I don't know. Maybe no one.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,363,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,364,Are you a queen or fish bait?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,365,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,366,A king wouldn't think twice about it.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,367,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,368,I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,369,sits beside you in the throne room.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,370,I don't want a crown. I want you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,371,I love you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,372,And I make you happy.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,373,You know I do.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,374,Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,375,I can't.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,376,The dwarf told you to do this?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,377,No one tells me to do anything.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,378,Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,379,I'm no use to you over there.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,380,Don't get angry.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,381,I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,382,Who comes after you?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,383,"Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,384,"A great number of women, I imagine."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,385,Specific orders will be left for you
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,386,regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,387,Bay of Dragons?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,388,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,389,"You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,390,I hope it brings you happiness.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,391,I pity the lords of Westeros.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,392,They have no idea what's coming for them.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,393,"Farewell, Daario Naharis."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,394,How did he take it?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,395,No tears.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,396,I know it was hard for you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,397,You turned away a man who truly loves you
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,398,because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,399,"That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,400,if it's any consolation.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,401,It's not.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,402,"No, I suppose not."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,403,I'm terrible at consoling.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,404,"Yes, you really are."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,405,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,406,"You have your armies, you have your ships,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,407,you have your dragons.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,408,Everything you've ever wanted
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,409,"since you were old enough to want anything,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,410,it's all yours for the taking.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,411,Are you afraid?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,412,Good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,413,You're in the great game now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,414,And the great game's terrifying.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,415,The only people who aren't afraid of failure
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,416,are madmen like your father.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,417,Do you know what frightens me?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,418,I said farewell to a man who loves me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,419,A man I thought I cared for.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,420,And I felt nothing.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,421,Just impatient to get on with it.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,422,He wasn't the first to love you
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,423,and he won't be the last.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,424,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,425,"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,426,Everyone's always asking me to believe in things...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,427,"family, gods, kings, myself."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,428,It was often tempting
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,429,until I saw where belief got people.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,430,"So I said no, thank you to belief."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,431,And yet here I am.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,432,I believe in you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,433,"It's embarrassing, really."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,434,"I'd swear you my sword,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,435,but I don't actually own a sword.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,436,It's your counsel I need.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,437,It's yours.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,438,Now and always.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,439,Good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,440,I...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,441,I had something made for you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,442,I'm not sure if it's right.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,443,"Tyrion Lannister,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,444,I name you Hand of the Queen.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,445,"You're not one of mine, are you?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,446,"No, my lord."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,447,Didn't think so.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,448,Too pretty.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,449,Where are my damn moron sons?!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,450,Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,451,"They're here, my lord."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,452,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,453,Tell them to come here now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,454,"But they're already here, my lord."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,455,"Here, my lord."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,456,They weren't easy to carve.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,457,Especially Black Walder.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,458,What...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,459,My name is Arya Stark.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,460,I want you to know that.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,461,The last thing you're ever going to see
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,462,is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,463,"Forgive me, my lady..."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,464,if you're at prayer.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,465,I'm done with all that.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,466,I came here every day when I was a girl.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,467,I prayed to be somewhere else.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,468,"Back then I only thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,469,I was a stupid girl.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,470,You were a child.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,471,What do you want?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,472,I thought you knew what I wanted.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,473,I was wrong.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,474,"No, you weren't."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,475,"Every time I'm faced with a decision,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,476,I close my eyes and see the same picture.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,477,"Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,478,will this action help to make this picture a reality?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,479,Pull it out of my mind
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,480,and into the world?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,481,And I only act if the answer is yes.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,482,A picture of me...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,483,on the Iron Throne...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,484,and you by my side.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,485,It's a pretty picture.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,486,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,487,I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,488,"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,489,It's never stopped you from serving yourself.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,490,The past is gone for good.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,491,You can sit here mourning its departure
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,492,or you can prepare for the future.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,493,"You, my love,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,494,are the future of House Stark.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,495,Who should the North rally behind?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,496,A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,497,born here at Winterfell
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,498,or a motherless bastard born in the south?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,499,This is where I leave you.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,500,You're not coming with us?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,501,The Wall is not just ice and stone.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,502,Ancient spells were carved into its foundations.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,503,Strong magic
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,504,to protect men from what lies beyond.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,505,"And while it stands, the dead cannot pass."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,506,I cannot pass.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,507,Where will you go?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,508,The great war is coming
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,509,and I still fight for the living.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,510,I'll do what I can...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,511,as long as I can.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,512,"Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,513,I wish you both good fortune.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,514,Are you sure you're ready for this?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,515,I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,516,I have to be ready for this.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,517,Ned?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,518,Lyanna.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,519,Is that you?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,520,Is that really you?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,521,You're not a dream?
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,522,"No, I'm not a dream."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,523,I'm here.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,524,Right here.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,525,"I've missed you, big brother."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,526,"I've missed you, too."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,527,I want to be brave.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,528,You are.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,529,I'm not.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,530,I don't want to die.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,531,You're not going to die.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,532,Get her some water!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,533,"- No, no water. - Is there a maester?"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,534,"Listen to me, Ned."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,535,_
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,536,"If Robert finds out, he'll..."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,537,you know he will.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,538,You have to protect him.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,539,"Promise me, Ned."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,540,Promise me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,541,"Promise me, Ned."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,542,Promise me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,543,You can't expect Knights of the Vale
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,544,to side with wildling invaders.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,545,We didn't invade. We were invited.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,546,Not by me.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,547,"The free folk, the northerners,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,548,"and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,549,"fought together, and we won."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,550,My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,551,The Boltons are defeated.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,552,The war is over.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,553,Winter has come.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,554,"If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,555,We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,556,The war is not over.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,557,"And I promise you, friend,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,558,the true enemy won't wait out the storm.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,559,He brings the storm.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,560,"Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,561,but you refused the call.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,562,"You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,563,"but in their hour of greatest need,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,564,you refused the call.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,565,"And you, Lord Cerwyn,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,566,your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,567,Still you refused the call.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,568,But House Mormont remembers.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,569,The North remembers.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,570,We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,571,I don't care if he's a bastard.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,572,Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,573,He's my king from this day until his last day.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,574,Lady Mormont speaks harshly
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,575,and truly.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,576,"My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,577,I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,578,I didn't commit my men to your cause
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,579,'cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,580,But I was wrong.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,581,Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,582,He is the White Wolf.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,583,The King in the North.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,584,I did not fight beside you on the field
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,585,and I will regret that until my dying day.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,586,A man can only admit when he was wrong
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,587,and ask forgiveness.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,588,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,589,There will be more fights to come.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,590,House Glover will stand behind House Stark
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,591,as we have for a thousand years.
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,592,And I will stand behind Jon Snow...
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,593,the King in the North!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,594,The King in the North!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,595,The King in the North! The King in the North!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,596,Company halt!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,597,Halt!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,598,Halt!
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,599,Come on.

S06E10,The Winds of Winter,601,"First of Her Name,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,602,"Queen of the Andals and the First Men,"
S06E10,The Winds of Winter,603,Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

S07E01,Dragonstone,180,from a family it has belonged to for centuries.
S07E01,Dragonstone,181,"That is my decision,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,182,and my decision is final.
S07E01,Dragonstone,183,Ned Umber.
S07E01,Dragonstone,184,Alys Karstark.
S07E01,Dragonstone,185,"For centuries, our families fought"
S07E01,Dragonstone,186,side by side on the battlefield.
S07E01,Dragonstone,187,"I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,188,to serve as our bannermen
S07E01,Dragonstone,189,and come to our aid whenever called upon.
S07E01,Dragonstone,190,Stand.
S07E01,Dragonstone,191,Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.
S07E01,Dragonstone,192,"The North needs to band together,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,193,all the living north.
S07E01,Dragonstone,194,"Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,195,now and always?
S07E01,Dragonstone,196,Both: Now and always!
S07E01,Dragonstone,197,"( men cheering, pounding tables )"
S07E01,Dragonstone,198,"Jon: You are my sister, but I am king now."
S07E01,Dragonstone,199,Will you start wearing a crown?
S07E01,Dragonstone,200,When you question my decisions
S07E01,Dragonstone,201,"in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
S07E01,Dragonstone,202,"- So I can't question your decisions anymore? - Of course you can, but--"
S07E01,Dragonstone,203,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority.
S07E01,Dragonstone,204,You think he was a good king?
S07E01,Dragonstone,205,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
S07E01,Dragonstone,206,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
S07E01,Dragonstone,207,Thank you.
S07E01,Dragonstone,208,"You're good at this, you know."
S07E01,Dragonstone,209,- At what? - At ruling.
S07E01,Dragonstone,210,( sighs ) No.
S07E01,Dragonstone,211,You are.
S07E01,Dragonstone,212,You are.
S07E01,Dragonstone,213,"They respect you, they really do,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,214,- but you have to-- - ( chuckles )
S07E01,Dragonstone,215,Why are you laughing?
S07E01,Dragonstone,216,What did father used to say?
S07E01,Dragonstone,217,"Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
S07E01,Dragonstone,218,He never said that to me.
S07E01,Dragonstone,219,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
S07E01,Dragonstone,220,Sansa: Because he was trying to protect us.
S07E01,Dragonstone,221,"He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,222,but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.
S07E01,Dragonstone,223,"- Stop trying. - All right, I'll stop trying to protect you"
S07E01,Dragonstone,224,and you stop trying to undermine me.
S07E01,Dragonstone,225,I'm not trying to undermine you!
S07E01,Dragonstone,226,You have to be smarter than Father.
S07E01,Dragonstone,227,You need to be smarter than Robb.
S07E01,Dragonstone,228,"I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,229,and they both lost their heads for it.
S07E01,Dragonstone,230,And how should I be smarter?
S07E01,Dragonstone,231,By listening to you?
S07E01,Dragonstone,232,Would that be so terrible?
S07E01,Dragonstone,233,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
S07E01,Dragonstone,234,"""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,235,"Queen of the Andals and the First Men,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,236,"Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"""
S07E01,Dragonstone,237,What does she want?
S07E01,Dragonstone,238,( sighs ) Come to King's Landing.
S07E01,Dragonstone,239,Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
S07E01,Dragonstone,240,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,241,you've forgotten about the one to the south.
S07E01,Dragonstone,242,I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him.
S07E01,Dragonstone,243,"And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
S07E01,Dragonstone,244,We still have a wall between us and the Night King.
S07E01,Dragonstone,245,There's nothing between us and Cersei.
S07E01,Dragonstone,246,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei.
S07E01,Dragonstone,247,Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army.
S07E01,Dragonstone,248,They've never ranged this far north.
S07E01,Dragonstone,249,"You're the military man, but I know her."
S07E01,Dragonstone,250,"If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you."
S07E01,Dragonstone,251,"Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
S07E01,Dragonstone,252,You almost sound as if you admire her.
S07E01,Dragonstone,253,I learned a great deal from her.
S07E01,Dragonstone,254,What is this?
S07E01,Dragonstone,255,It's what we've been waiting for our whole lives.
S07E01,Dragonstone,256,"It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
S07E01,Dragonstone,257,He knew it.
S07E01,Dragonstone,258,"Made me memorize every damn city, town,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,259,"lake, forest, and mountain."
S07E01,Dragonstone,260,It's ours now. We just have to take it.
S07E01,Dragonstone,261,You've been quiet since you came home.
S07E01,Dragonstone,262,Are you angry with me?
S07E01,Dragonstone,263,"No, not angry."
S07E01,Dragonstone,264,Are you afraid of me?
S07E01,Dragonstone,265,Should I be?
S07E01,Dragonstone,266,Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.
S07E01,Dragonstone,267,"Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,268,hoping to take back her father's throne.
S07E01,Dragonstone,269,"Our little brother,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,270,"the one you love so much,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,271,"the one you set free,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,272,"the one who murdered our father and our first-born son,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,273,now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel.
S07E01,Dragonstone,274,He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada.
S07E01,Dragonstone,275,Where will they land?
S07E01,Dragonstone,276,Dragonstone.
S07E01,Dragonstone,277,They have deep-water ports for the ships.
S07E01,Dragonstone,278,"Stannis left the castle unoccupied,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,279,and that's where she was born.
S07E01,Dragonstone,280,Enemies to the east.
S07E01,Dragonstone,281,Enemies to the south--
S07E01,Dragonstone,282,Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
S07E01,Dragonstone,283,Enemies to the west--
S07E01,Dragonstone,284,"Olenna, the old cunt."
S07E01,Dragonstone,285,Another traitor.
S07E01,Dragonstone,286,Enemies to the north.
S07E01,Dragonstone,287,Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North
S07E01,Dragonstone,288,and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him.
S07E01,Dragonstone,289,Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors.
S07E01,Dragonstone,290,You're in command of the Lannister army now.
S07E01,Dragonstone,291,- How do we proceed? - Winter is here.
S07E01,Dragonstone,292,We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses.
S07E01,Dragonstone,293,"The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
S07E01,Dragonstone,294,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside
S07E01,Dragonstone,295,a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
S07E01,Dragonstone,296,If they think Daenerys will win.
S07E01,Dragonstone,297,No one wants to fight on the losing side.
S07E01,Dragonstone,298,"Right now, we look like the losing side."
S07E01,Dragonstone,299,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
S07E01,Dragonstone,300,"Three kingdoms, at best."
S07E01,Dragonstone,301,I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.
S07E01,Dragonstone,302,I understand we're in a war for survival.
S07E01,Dragonstone,303,I understand whoever loses dies.
S07E01,Dragonstone,304,I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty
S07E01,Dragonstone,305,that lasts a thousand years.
S07E01,Dragonstone,306,A dynasty for whom?
S07E01,Dragonstone,307,Our children are dead.
S07E01,Dragonstone,308,We're the last of us.
S07E01,Dragonstone,309,"A dynasty for us, then."
S07E01,Dragonstone,310,We never talked about Tommen.
S07E01,Dragonstone,311,There's nothing to say.
S07E01,Dragonstone,312,Our baby boy killed himself.
S07E01,Dragonstone,313,He betrayed me.
S07E01,Dragonstone,314,He betrayed us both.
S07E01,Dragonstone,315,Should we spend our days mourning the dead--
S07E01,Dragonstone,316,"mother, father, and all our children?"
S07E01,Dragonstone,317,- Cersei-- - I loved them. I did.
S07E01,Dragonstone,318,But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood.
S07E01,Dragonstone,319,"We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
S07E01,Dragonstone,320,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies.
S07E01,Dragonstone,321,Where are our allies now?
S07E01,Dragonstone,322,You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
S07E01,Dragonstone,323,I heard.
S07E01,Dragonstone,324,- How could we ever trust a man like that? - We couldn't.
S07E01,Dragonstone,325,"He was a useless, old coward,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,326,but the Freys supported us.
S07E01,Dragonstone,327,Now they're all dead.
S07E01,Dragonstone,328,Whoever killed them is no friend of ours.
S07E01,Dragonstone,329,We need allies.
S07E01,Dragonstone,330,"Stronger, better allies."
S07E01,Dragonstone,331,We can't win this war alone.
S07E01,Dragonstone,332,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
S07E01,Dragonstone,333,( seagulls screeching )
S07E01,Dragonstone,334,Jaime: The Greyjoys?
S07E01,Dragonstone,335,You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
S07E01,Dragonstone,336,"- Not all of them. - Well, it looks like all of them."
S07E01,Dragonstone,337,"I invited Euron Greyjoy,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,338,the new King of the Iron Islands.
S07E01,Dragonstone,339,"You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies."
S07E01,Dragonstone,340,- There you are. - How are they better allies?
S07E01,Dragonstone,341,How are they different from the Freys?
S07E01,Dragonstone,342,They both broke their promises
S07E01,Dragonstone,343,and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
S07E01,Dragonstone,344,So does everyone when it suits them.
S07E01,Dragonstone,345,"Unlike the Freys, they have ships."
S07E01,Dragonstone,346,- And they're good at killing. - They're not good at anything.
S07E01,Dragonstone,347,"I know the ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people."
S07E01,Dragonstone,348,All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.
S07E01,Dragonstone,349,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
S07E01,Dragonstone,350,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
S07E01,Dragonstone,351,A queen.
S07E01,Dragonstone,352,"Euron: The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,353,they turned on me. ( chuckles )
S07E01,Dragonstone,354,Their own uncle.
S07E01,Dragonstone,355,They stole my best ships and ran.
S07E01,Dragonstone,356,Sailed them right across the world
S07E01,Dragonstone,357,and gave them to the Dragon Queen
S07E01,Dragonstone,358,so she could bring her armies here to attack you.
S07E01,Dragonstone,359,It's nothing compared to the treason you suffered
S07E01,Dragonstone,360,"at the hands of a family member, from what I hear."
S07E01,Dragonstone,361,"But still, it bothers me."
S07E01,Dragonstone,362,Murdering them would make me feel a lot better.
S07E01,Dragonstone,363,And since it appears that all our treasonous family members
S07E01,Dragonstone,364,"are fighting for the same side,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,365,I thought we rightful monarchs
S07E01,Dragonstone,366,could murder them together.
S07E01,Dragonstone,367,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
S07E01,Dragonstone,368,"The Greyjoys rebelled against the throne for the right to be monarchs,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,369,"but as I recall, you were soundly defeated."
S07E01,Dragonstone,370,"Come to mention it,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,371,weren't you the one who started that rebellion
S07E01,Dragonstone,372,by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet?
S07E01,Dragonstone,373,You certainly caught us there.
S07E01,Dragonstone,374,Very smart move on your part.
S07E01,Dragonstone,375,"Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway."
S07E01,Dragonstone,376,I was there.
S07E01,Dragonstone,377,I remember very well.
S07E01,Dragonstone,378,I saw you.
S07E01,Dragonstone,379,I heard so much talk.
S07E01,Dragonstone,380,The best in the world. No one can stop him.
S07E01,Dragonstone,381,"I didn't believe it, to be honest."
S07E01,Dragonstone,382,But I must say when you rushed through the breach
S07E01,Dragonstone,383,and started cutting people down...
S07E01,Dragonstone,384,it was glorious.
S07E01,Dragonstone,385,Like a dance.
S07E01,Dragonstone,386,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
S07E01,Dragonstone,387,The place was getting crowded.
S07E01,Dragonstone,388,I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
S07E01,Dragonstone,389,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
S07E01,Dragonstone,390,A good thing for me.
S07E01,Dragonstone,391,"If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile."
S07E01,Dragonstone,392,"If I hadn't done that,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,393,I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.
S07E01,Dragonstone,394,If not the most humble.
S07E01,Dragonstone,395,You're not humble.
S07E01,Dragonstone,396,You're the queen of a great nation.
S07E01,Dragonstone,397,You don't care about the Iron Islands.
S07E01,Dragonstone,398,They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--
S07E01,Dragonstone,399,and a lot of very unattractive people.
S07E01,Dragonstone,400,"The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,401,that's something else entirely.
S07E01,Dragonstone,402,It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.
S07E01,Dragonstone,403,"With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas."
S07E01,Dragonstone,404,You can defeat the invaders of the east
S07E01,Dragonstone,405,and the pretenders of the north and south.
S07E01,Dragonstone,406,What do you want in return?
S07E01,Dragonstone,407,"Ever since I was a little boy,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,408,I wanted to grow up and marry
S07E01,Dragonstone,409,the most beautiful woman in the world.
S07E01,Dragonstone,410,"So here I am,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,411,with a thousand ships
S07E01,Dragonstone,412,and two good hands.
S07E01,Dragonstone,413,I decline your proposal.
S07E01,Dragonstone,414,Why?
S07E01,Dragonstone,415,You're not trustworthy.
S07E01,Dragonstone,416,You've broken promises to allies before
S07E01,Dragonstone,417,and murdered them at the nearest opportunity.
S07E01,Dragonstone,418,You murdered your own brother.
S07E01,Dragonstone,419,You should try it. Feels wonderful.
S07E01,Dragonstone,420,( laughs )
S07E01,Dragonstone,421,I don't expect you to trust me outright.
S07E01,Dragonstone,422,You need proof of my honest intentions.
S07E01,Dragonstone,423,"In my experience,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,424,the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.
S07E01,Dragonstone,425,A priceless gift.
S07E01,Dragonstone,426,I won't return to King's Landing
S07E01,Dragonstone,427,until I have that for you.
S07E01,Dragonstone,428,( labored breathing )
S07E01,Dragonstone,429,- ( man breathing heavily ) - ( men coughing )
S07E01,Dragonstone,430,"( farts, groans )"
S07E01,Dragonstone,431,( gagging )
S07E01,Dragonstone,432,- ( flies buzzing ) - ( coughs )
S07E01,Dragonstone,433,( grunts )
S07E01,Dragonstone,434,( sighs )
S07E01,Dragonstone,435,( chatter )
S07E01,Dragonstone,436,( gagging )
S07E01,Dragonstone,437,( sighs )

S07E01,Dragonstone,442,( gags )
S07E01,Dragonstone,443,( gags )

S07E01,Dragonstone,445,( gate rattles )
S07E01,Dragonstone,446,( chain rattling )
S07E01,Dragonstone,447,( gate closes )
S07E01,Dragonstone,448,"Ah, Maester Weyland."
S07E01,Dragonstone,449,( grunts ) A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.
S07E01,Dragonstone,450,Weigh that.
S07E01,Dragonstone,451,The triumph of transitory pleasures.
S07E01,Dragonstone,452,Mankind's curse.
S07E01,Dragonstone,453,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
S07E01,Dragonstone,454,What's the weight?
S07E01,Dragonstone,455,"Um, 147."
S07E01,Dragonstone,456,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
S07E01,Dragonstone,457,I don't remember your proposition.
S07E01,Dragonstone,458,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,459,if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.
S07E01,Dragonstone,460,That area is reserved for maesters.
S07E01,Dragonstone,461,- Are you a maester? - No.
S07E01,Dragonstone,462,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
S07E01,Dragonstone,463,"Archmaester, with respect,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,464,I've seen them--
S07E01,Dragonstone,465,the Army of the Dead.
S07E01,Dragonstone,466,The white walkers.
S07E01,Dragonstone,467,"I was sent here to learn how to defeat them,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,468,"but everyone in the Citadel,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,469,"those who will even talk to me,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,470,they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.
S07E01,Dragonstone,471,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything.
S07E01,Dragonstone,472,It's their job.
S07E01,Dragonstone,473,But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication.
S07E01,Dragonstone,474,Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
S07E01,Dragonstone,475,Sources in the restricted area?
S07E01,Dragonstone,476,The very same.
S07E01,Dragonstone,477,And the simplest explanation
S07E01,Dragonstone,478,for your grating obsession with the white walkers
S07E01,Dragonstone,479,is that you're telling the truth
S07E01,Dragonstone,480,and that you saw what you say you saw.
S07E01,Dragonstone,481,"So, you believe me."
S07E01,Dragonstone,482,I do.
S07E01,Dragonstone,483,You'll finish weighing that heart?
S07E01,Dragonstone,484,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
S07E01,Dragonstone,485,We're not like the people south of the Twins.
S07E01,Dragonstone,486,And we're not like the people north of the Twins.
S07E01,Dragonstone,487,"In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons."
S07E01,Dragonstone,488,"We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly."
S07E01,Dragonstone,489,"Without us, men would be little better than dogs."
S07E01,Dragonstone,490,"Don't remember any meal but the last,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,491,can't see forward to any but the next.
S07E01,Dragonstone,492,"And every time you leave the house and shut the door,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,493,they howl like you're gone forever.
S07E01,Dragonstone,494,"When Robert's Rebellion was raging,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,495,people thought the end was near.
S07E01,Dragonstone,496,"The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"""
S07E01,Dragonstone,497,When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward
S07E01,Dragonstone,498,and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--
S07E01,Dragonstone,499,"""The end is near! How will we survive?"""
S07E01,Dragonstone,500,"And thousands of years before that, during the Long Night,"
S07E01,Dragonstone,501,we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end.
S07E01,Dragonstone,502,But it wasn't. None of it was.
S07E01,Dragonstone,503,The Wall has stood through it all.
S07E01,Dragonstone,504,And every winter that ever came has ended.
S07E01,Dragonstone,505,Be a good lad. Clean this up.
S07E01,Dragonstone,506,( men snoring )
S07E01,Dragonstone,507,( both grunting )
S07E01,Dragonstone,508,- Nope. - ( grunts )

S07E02,Stormborn,92,What kind of a servant is that?
S07E02,Stormborn,93,The kind the realm needs.
S07E02,Stormborn,94,Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.
S07E02,Stormborn,95,"As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them."
S07E02,Stormborn,96,I wasn't born into a great house.
S07E02,Stormborn,97,I came from nothing.
S07E02,Stormborn,98,I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.
S07E02,Stormborn,99,"When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses."
S07E02,Stormborn,100,You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?
S07E02,Stormborn,101,"Not with any king or queen, but with the people."
S07E02,Stormborn,102,The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.
S07E02,Stormborn,103,The people whose hearts you aim to win.
S07E02,Stormborn,104,"If you demand blind allegiance,"
S07E02,Stormborn,105,I respect your wishes.
S07E02,Stormborn,106,Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.
S07E02,Stormborn,107,"But if you let me live, I will serve you well."
S07E02,Stormborn,108,I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne
S07E02,Stormborn,109,because I choose you.
S07E02,Stormborn,110,Because I know the people have no better chance than you.
S07E02,Stormborn,111,"Swear this to me, Varys."
S07E02,Stormborn,112,"If you ever think I'm failing the people,"
S07E02,Stormborn,113,you won't conspire behind my back.
S07E02,Stormborn,114,"You'll look me in the eye as you have done today,"
S07E02,Stormborn,115,and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.
S07E02,Stormborn,116,"I swear it, my queen."
S07E02,Stormborn,117,"And I swear this-- if you ever betray me,"
S07E02,Stormborn,118,I'll burn you alive.
S07E02,Stormborn,119,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
S07E02,Stormborn,120,"Forgive me, my queen."
S07E02,Stormborn,121,A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.
S07E02,Stormborn,122,( speaking Valyrian )
S07E02,Stormborn,123,She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.
S07E02,Stormborn,124,"It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
S07E02,Stormborn,125,"No, it didn't."
S07E02,Stormborn,126,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
S07E02,Stormborn,127,We've just decided to pardon those
S07E02,Stormborn,128,who once served the wrong king.
S07E02,Stormborn,129,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
S07E02,Stormborn,130,"Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord"
S07E02,Stormborn,131,can serve his cause.
S07E02,Stormborn,132,What does your lord expect from me?
S07E02,Stormborn,133,"""The prince who was promised will bring the dawn."""
S07E02,Stormborn,134,I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
S07E02,Stormborn,135,"Missandei: Your Grace, forgive me,"
S07E02,Stormborn,136,but your translation is not quite accurate.
S07E02,Stormborn,137,"That noun has no gender in High Valyrian,"
S07E02,Stormborn,138,"so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,"
S07E02,Stormborn,139,"""The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."""
S07E02,Stormborn,140,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
S07E02,Stormborn,141,"No, but I like it better."
S07E02,Stormborn,142,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
S07E02,Stormborn,143,Prophecies are dangerous things.
S07E02,Stormborn,144,I believe you have a role to play.
S07E02,Stormborn,145,As does another--
S07E02,Stormborn,146,"the King in the North, Jon Snow."
S07E02,Stormborn,147,Jon Snow?
S07E02,Stormborn,148,- Ned Stark's bastard? - You know him?
S07E02,Stormborn,149,I travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
S07E02,Stormborn,150,And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?
S07E02,Stormborn,151,"Aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is."
S07E02,Stormborn,152,"As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,"
S07E02,Stormborn,153,he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall
S07E02,Stormborn,154,to protect them from grave danger.
S07E02,Stormborn,155,"As King in the North,"
S07E02,Stormborn,156,"he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses,"
S07E02,Stormborn,157,so together they may face their common enemy.
S07E02,Stormborn,158,He sounds like quite a man.
S07E02,Stormborn,159,Summon Jon Snow.
S07E02,Stormborn,160,Let him stand before you
S07E02,Stormborn,161,"and tell you the things that have happened to him,"
S07E02,Stormborn,162,the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
S07E02,Stormborn,163,I can't speak to prophecies
S07E02,Stormborn,164,"or visions in the flames,"
S07E02,Stormborn,165,but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.
S07E02,Stormborn,166,And I am an excellent judge of character.
S07E02,Stormborn,167,"If he does rule the North,"
S07E02,Stormborn,168,he would make a valuable ally.
S07E02,Stormborn,169,The Lannisters executed his father
S07E02,Stormborn,170,and conspired to murder his brother.
S07E02,Stormborn,171,Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.
S07E02,Stormborn,172,Very well.
S07E02,Stormborn,173,Send a raven north.
S07E02,Stormborn,174,Tell Jon Snow that his queen
S07E02,Stormborn,175,invites him to come to Dragonstone...
S07E02,Stormborn,176,and bend the knee.
S07E02,Stormborn,177,( chatter )
S07E02,Stormborn,178,Gather round. Come here.
S07E02,Stormborn,179,Sansa: You think it's really Tyrion?
S07E02,Stormborn,180,It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
S07E02,Stormborn,181,Read the last bit.
S07E02,Stormborn,182,"""All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes."""
S07E02,Stormborn,183,What does that mean?
S07E02,Stormborn,184,It's something he said to me the first night we met.
S07E02,Stormborn,185,You know him better than any of us.
S07E02,Stormborn,186,What do you think?
S07E02,Stormborn,187,Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.
S07E02,Stormborn,188,"He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk."
S07E02,Stormborn,189,"""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed"
S07E02,Stormborn,190,as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.
S07E02,Stormborn,191,Join us.
S07E02,Stormborn,192,"Together, we can end her tyranny."""
S07E02,Stormborn,193,Sounds like a charmer.
S07E02,Stormborn,194,"Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde,"
S07E02,Stormborn,195,"a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons--"
S07E02,Stormborn,196,a bit less charming.
S07E02,Stormborn,197,What?
S07E02,Stormborn,198,"Fire kills wights, you told me."
S07E02,Stormborn,199,What breathes fire?
S07E02,Stormborn,200,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
S07E02,Stormborn,201,"- No, too dangerous. - But?"
S07E02,Stormborn,202,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall,"
S07E02,Stormborn,203,do we have enough men to fight them?
S07E02,Stormborn,204,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne,"
S07E02,Stormborn,205,she'll destroy the realm as we know it.
S07E02,Stormborn,206,Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.
S07E02,Stormborn,207,But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.
S07E02,Stormborn,208,"With their help, the Mad King's daughter"
S07E02,Stormborn,209,has ferried an army of savages to our shores--
S07E02,Stormborn,210,"mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,"
S07E02,Stormborn,211,"Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground,"
S07E02,Stormborn,212,"rape and enslave your women,"
S07E02,Stormborn,213,and butcher your children without a second thought.
S07E02,Stormborn,214,This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.
S07E02,Stormborn,215,- ( people murmuring ) - Cersei: You all remember the Mad King.
S07E02,Stormborn,216,You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.
S07E02,Stormborn,217,His daughter is no different.
S07E02,Stormborn,218,"In Essos, her brutality is already legendary."
S07E02,Stormborn,219,She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.
S07E02,Stormborn,220,"And when she grew bored of that,"
S07E02,Stormborn,221,she fed them to her dragons.
S07E02,Stormborn,222,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will."
S07E02,Stormborn,223,"But I need your help, my lords."
S07E02,Stormborn,224,"We must stand together, all of us..."
S07E02,Stormborn,225,if we hope to stop her.
S07E02,Stormborn,226,( all murmuring )
S07E02,Stormborn,227,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace."
S07E02,Stormborn,228,The same as Aegon when he conquered
S07E02,Stormborn,229,the Seven Kingdoms.
S07E02,Stormborn,230,How do you propose to stop them?
S07E02,Stormborn,231,"We are currently at work on a solution, my lord."
S07E02,Stormborn,232,( chatter )
S07E02,Stormborn,233,Lord Tarly.
S07E02,Stormborn,234,Ser Jaime.
S07E02,Stormborn,235,I believe you know my son.
S07E02,Stormborn,236,Ser Jaime.
S07E02,Stormborn,237,"Rickard, isn't it?"
S07E02,Stormborn,238,Dickon.
S07E02,Stormborn,239,That's it.
S07E02,Stormborn,240,Thank you for coming.
S07E02,Stormborn,241,"The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever."
S07E02,Stormborn,242,They might not have come if you hadn't.
S07E02,Stormborn,243,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call."
S07E02,Stormborn,244,And I've heard what she does to those who defy her.
S07E02,Stormborn,245,You ride for Horn Hill today?
S07E02,Stormborn,246,I have an army to mobilize.
S07E02,Stormborn,247,Won't be long before the fighting starts.
S07E02,Stormborn,248,And which side will you be fighting for?
S07E02,Stormborn,249,You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.
S07E02,Stormborn,250,Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could do that.
S07E02,Stormborn,251,"It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
S07E02,Stormborn,252,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.
S07E02,Stormborn,253,I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei
S07E02,Stormborn,254,and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.
S07E02,Stormborn,255,All her enemies.
S07E02,Stormborn,256,Including Olenna Tyrell.
S07E02,Stormborn,257,I'm a Tarly.
S07E02,Stormborn,258,That name means something.
S07E02,Stormborn,259,We're not oathbreakers. We're not schemers.
S07E02,Stormborn,260,We don't stab our rivals in the back
S07E02,Stormborn,261,or cut their throats at weddings.
S07E02,Stormborn,262,I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
S07E02,Stormborn,263,"You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly."
S07E02,Stormborn,264,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
S07E02,Stormborn,265,She was a great woman once.
S07E02,Stormborn,266,Now she's broken.
S07E02,Stormborn,267,"She wants revenge so badly,"
S07E02,Stormborn,268,she brought the Dothraki to our shores.
S07E02,Stormborn,269,The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.
S07E02,Stormborn,270,"I know you don't like my sister,"
S07E02,Stormborn,271,but you have to make a choice.
S07E02,Stormborn,272,Do you fight with us
S07E02,Stormborn,273,or with foreign savages and eunuchs?
S07E02,Stormborn,274,"When the war is won,"
S07E02,Stormborn,275,the queen will need a new Warden of the South.
S07E02,Stormborn,276,I can think of no better man
S07E02,Stormborn,277,than Randyll Tarly.
S07E02,Stormborn,278,Ebrose: The infection has spread too far.
S07E02,Stormborn,279,You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
S07E02,Stormborn,280,How long?
S07E02,Stormborn,281,It'll be years before it kills you.
S07E02,Stormborn,282,Could be 10.
S07E02,Stormborn,283,Could be 20.
S07E02,Stormborn,284,But how long until...?
S07E02,Stormborn,285,Your mind?
S07E02,Stormborn,286,"Six months, maybe fewer."
S07E02,Stormborn,287,( grunts )
S07E02,Stormborn,288,Um...
S07E02,Stormborn,289,"Pardon, Archmaester."
S07E02,Stormborn,290,I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.
S07E02,Stormborn,291,She had the greyscale as a baby and was cured.
S07E02,Stormborn,292,- Ebrose: No. - Isn't there some way--
S07E02,Stormborn,293,Ebrose: Does this look like a baby to you?
S07E02,Stormborn,294,- No. - Have you studied
S07E02,Stormborn,295,the varying rates of greyscale progression
S07E02,Stormborn,296,in infants and fully grown men?
S07E02,Stormborn,297,No.
S07E02,Stormborn,298,Ebrose: Maester Cressen discovered
S07E02,Stormborn,299,Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
S07E02,Stormborn,300,This is quite advanced.
S07E02,Stormborn,301,"And beyond our skills, ser."
S07E02,Stormborn,302,"Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once"
S07E02,Stormborn,303,to live out your life with the stone men.
S07E02,Stormborn,304,"As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day."
S07E02,Stormborn,305,How you choose to spend that time is up to you.
S07E02,Stormborn,306,"Come, Samwell."
S07E02,Stormborn,307,"Should we send word to your family, Ser...?"
S07E02,Stormborn,308,Jorah.
S07E02,Stormborn,309,Jorah Mormont.
S07E02,Stormborn,310,Mormont?
S07E02,Stormborn,311,There's no need.
S07E02,Stormborn,312,I've been dead to them for years.
S07E02,Stormborn,313,"Ebrose: Come, Samwell!"
S07E02,Stormborn,314,"Qyburn: Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
S07E02,Stormborn,315,"No, I can't say I have."
S07E02,Stormborn,316,I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the throne room.
S07E02,Stormborn,317,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
S07E02,Stormborn,318,They were his trophies.
S07E02,Stormborn,319,He couldn't keep them around.
S07E02,Stormborn,320,They would have made him look small.
S07E02,Stormborn,321,Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.
S07E02,Stormborn,322,I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
S07E02,Stormborn,323,Balerion the Dread.
S07E02,Stormborn,324,The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.
S07E02,Stormborn,325,His flames forged the Iron Throne
S07E02,Stormborn,326,and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.
S07E02,Stormborn,327,Powerful...
S07E02,Stormborn,328,but not invincible.
S07E02,Stormborn,329,"Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons"
S07E02,Stormborn,330,was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.
S07E02,Stormborn,331,"And if they can be wounded,"
S07E02,Stormborn,332,they can be killed.
S07E02,Stormborn,333,The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing
S07E02,Stormborn,334,"have been laboring day and night, Your Grace."
S07E02,Stormborn,335,If you'll kindly pull that lever.
S07E02,Stormborn,336,"Yara: If you want the Iron Throne, take it."
S07E02,Stormborn,337,"We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons."
S07E02,Stormborn,338,"We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have."
S07E02,Stormborn,339,The city will fall within a day.
S07E02,Stormborn,340,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
S07E02,Stormborn,341,It's called war.
S07E02,Stormborn,342,"You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
S07E02,Stormborn,343,I know how you wage war.
S07E02,Stormborn,344,We don't poison little girls here.
S07E02,Stormborn,345,Myrcella was innocent.
S07E02,Stormborn,346,She was a Lannister.
S07E02,Stormborn,347,There are no innocent Lannisters.
S07E02,Stormborn,348,My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
S07E02,Stormborn,349,Daenerys: That's enough.
S07E02,Stormborn,350,Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.
S07E02,Stormborn,351,You will treat him with respect.
S07E02,Stormborn,352,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
S07E02,Stormborn,353,That's very nice to hear.
S07E02,Stormborn,354,"Of course, I can't remember a queen"
S07E02,Stormborn,355,who was better loved than my granddaughter.
S07E02,Stormborn,356,The common people loved her.
S07E02,Stormborn,357,The nobles loved her.
S07E02,Stormborn,358,And what is left of her now?
S07E02,Stormborn,359,Ashes.
S07E02,Stormborn,360,"Commoners, nobles,"
S07E02,Stormborn,361,"they're all just children, really."
S07E02,Stormborn,362,They won't obey you unless they fear you.
S07E02,Stormborn,363,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel."
S07E02,Stormborn,364,I'm grateful to all of you.
S07E02,Stormborn,365,But you have chosen to follow me.
S07E02,Stormborn,366,I will not attack King's Landing.
S07E02,Stormborn,367,We will not attack King's Landing.
S07E02,Stormborn,368,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?
S07E02,Stormborn,369,By asking nicely?
S07E02,Stormborn,370,"We will lay siege to the capital,"
S07E02,Stormborn,371,surrounding the city on all sides.
S07E02,Stormborn,372,"Cersei will have the Iron Throne,"
S07E02,Stormborn,373,but no food for her army or the people.
S07E02,Stormborn,374,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
S07E02,Stormborn,375,Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros
S07E02,Stormborn,376,"by appealing to their loyalty,"
S07E02,Stormborn,377,their love for their country.
S07E02,Stormborn,378,"If we besiege the city with foreigners,"
S07E02,Stormborn,379,we prove her point.
S07E02,Stormborn,380,Our army should be Westerosi.
S07E02,Stormborn,381,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
S07E02,Stormborn,382,You are.
S07E02,Stormborn,383,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.
S07E02,Stormborn,384,And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army
S07E02,Stormborn,385,back up to King's Landing.
S07E02,Stormborn,386,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital
S07E02,Stormborn,387,alongside the Tyrell army.
S07E02,Stormborn,388,Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
S07E02,Stormborn,389,"So, your master plan is to use our armies."
S07E02,Stormborn,390,"Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
S07E02,Stormborn,391,The Unsullied will have another objective.
S07E02,Stormborn,392,"For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros."
S07E02,Stormborn,393,And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.
S07E02,Stormborn,394,Grey Worm and the Unsullied
S07E02,Stormborn,395,will sail for the Rock and take it.
S07E02,Stormborn,396,Do I have your support?
S07E02,Stormborn,397,You have mine.
S07E02,Stormborn,398,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
S07E02,Stormborn,399,Thank you all.
S07E02,Stormborn,400,"Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
S07E02,Stormborn,401,( door closes )
S07E02,Stormborn,402,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.
S07E02,Stormborn,403,"But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done."
S07E02,Stormborn,404,And we will bring peace back to Westeros.
S07E02,Stormborn,405,Peace?
S07E02,Stormborn,406,Do you think that's what we had under your father?
S07E02,Stormborn,407,Or his father? Or his?
S07E02,Stormborn,408,"Peace never lasts, my dear."
S07E02,Stormborn,409,Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?
S07E02,Stormborn,410,"He's a clever man, your Hand."
S07E02,Stormborn,411,I've known a great many clever men.
S07E02,Stormborn,412,I've outlived them all.
S07E02,Stormborn,413,You know why?
S07E02,Stormborn,414,I ignored them.
S07E02,Stormborn,415,The lords of Westeros are sheep.
S07E02,Stormborn,416,Are you a sheep?
S07E02,Stormborn,417,No.
S07E02,Stormborn,418,You're a dragon.
S07E02,Stormborn,419,Be a dragon.
S07E02,Stormborn,420,- ( knocking on door ) - Grey Worm: Mají.
S07E02,Stormborn,421,( door opens )
S07E02,Stormborn,422,You leave tomorrow.
S07E02,Stormborn,423,Were you going to say goodbye?
S07E02,Stormborn,424,I will see you when I return.
S07E02,Stormborn,425,But you don't know when that will be.
S07E02,Stormborn,426,No one knows.
S07E02,Stormborn,427,I wish you good fortune.
S07E02,Stormborn,428,Missandei.
S07E02,Stormborn,429,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
S07E02,Stormborn,430,Why?
S07E02,Stormborn,431,You know why.
S07E02,Stormborn,432,I don't.
S07E02,Stormborn,433,Y-you are my weakness.
S07E02,Stormborn,434,That's what I am?
S07E02,Stormborn,435,Your weakness?
S07E02,Stormborn,436,"When Unsullied are young, the masters learn their fears."
S07E02,Stormborn,437,"One boy is scared of dogs,"
S07E02,Stormborn,438,"one boy hates high places,"
S07E02,Stormborn,439,one is frightened of the ocean.
S07E02,Stormborn,440,They make the boy sleep with dogs
S07E02,Stormborn,441,or climb a cliff.
S07E02,Stormborn,442,They throw him in the water.
S07E02,Stormborn,443,"If he learns to swim, good."
S07E02,Stormborn,444,"If he drowns, good."
S07E02,Stormborn,445,"Either way, strong Unsullied."
S07E02,Stormborn,446,But I had no fears.
S07E02,Stormborn,447,"I was never the biggest, never the strongest..."
S07E02,Stormborn,448,"but I was bravest, always."
S07E02,Stormborn,449,- I believe it. - Until...
S07E02,Stormborn,450,I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.
S07E02,Stormborn,451,Now I have fear.
S07E02,Stormborn,452,"I do, too."
S07E02,Stormborn,453,( sniffles )
S07E02,Stormborn,454,No.
S07E02,Stormborn,455,I want to see you.
S07E02,Stormborn,456,Please.
S07E02,Stormborn,457,( panting )
S07E02,Stormborn,458,Might be useful.
S07E02,Stormborn,459,"Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,"
S07E02,Stormborn,460,but an excellent researcher.
S07E02,Stormborn,461,"- Archmaester, I wondered if I-- - And this one."
S07E02,Stormborn,462,Maester Faull was quite the opposite--
S07E02,Stormborn,463,a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
S07E02,Stormborn,464,"Um, I wanted to ask you--"
S07E02,Stormborn,465,"If you're going to write histories, Tarly,"
S07E02,Stormborn,466,you have to do the research.
S07E02,Stormborn,467,"If you want people to read your histories,"
S07E02,Stormborn,468,you need a bit of style.
S07E02,Stormborn,469,"I'm not writing ""A Chronicle of the Wars"
S07E02,Stormborn,470,"Following the Death of King Robert I"""
S07E02,Stormborn,471,so it can sit on a shelf unread.
S07E02,Stormborn,472,What? You don't like the title?
S07E02,Stormborn,473,"What would you call it, then?"
S07E02,Stormborn,474,"Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?"
S07E02,Stormborn,475,"We're not poets, Tarly."
S07E02,Stormborn,476,"Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
S07E02,Stormborn,477,This is your moment.
S07E02,Stormborn,478,Use it wisely.
S07E02,Stormborn,479,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.
S07E02,Stormborn,480,There are two recorded cases
S07E02,Stormborn,481,of advanced greyscale being cured.
S07E02,Stormborn,482,I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases
S07E02,Stormborn,483,by Archmaester Pylos.
S07E02,Stormborn,484,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos
S07E02,Stormborn,485,and his study of rare diseases.
S07E02,Stormborn,486,"- Oh, you are? - Yes."
S07E02,Stormborn,487,And shall I tell you how he died?
S07E02,Stormborn,488,From greyscale.
S07E02,Stormborn,489,"- Oh. - The procedure's far too dangerous,"
S07E02,Stormborn,490,which is why it's now forbidden.
S07E02,Stormborn,491,( cart wheels squeaking )
S07E02,Stormborn,492,( door opens )
S07E02,Stormborn,493,Hello.
S07E02,Stormborn,494,- What are you doing? - ( door closes )
S07E02,Stormborn,495,"You're Jorah Mormont,"
S07E02,Stormborn,496,the only son of Jeor Mormont.
S07E02,Stormborn,497,"My name is Samwell Tarly,"
S07E02,Stormborn,498,"Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,"
S07E02,Stormborn,499,training to serve as maester at Castle Black.
S07E02,Stormborn,500,I knew your father.
S07E02,Stormborn,501,I was with him when he died.
S07E02,Stormborn,502,"You are not dying today, Ser Jorah."
S07E02,Stormborn,503,Drink this.
S07E02,Stormborn,504,- What is it? - Rum.
S07E02,Stormborn,505,"Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
S07E02,Stormborn,506,( coughing )
S07E02,Stormborn,507,( clears throat )
S07E02,Stormborn,508,If you could take off your shirt.
S07E02,Stormborn,509,( grunts )
S07E02,Stormborn,510,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard."
S07E02,Stormborn,511,"I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,"
S07E02,Stormborn,512,"and if they hear you screaming, then we're both finished."
S07E02,Stormborn,513,Jorah: Have you ever done this before?
S07E02,Stormborn,514,No.
S07E02,Stormborn,515,"But no one else will try it, so I'm the best you've got."
S07E02,Stormborn,516,Have a seat.
S07E02,Stormborn,517,"I'm going to have to remove the entire upper layer of infected tissue,"
S07E02,Stormborn,518,then apply a medicinal ointment to the...
S07E02,Stormborn,519,"- ( groaning ) - Shh, shh!"
S07E02,Stormborn,520,Shh.
S07E02,Stormborn,521,"Again, I'm sorry,"
S07E02,Stormborn,522,but please try not to scream.
S07E02,Stormborn,523,( grunting )
S07E02,Stormborn,524,( shushing )
S07E02,Stormborn,525,( whimpering )
S07E02,Stormborn,526,( groans )
S07E02,Stormborn,527,( muffled shouting )
S07E02,Stormborn,528,"( chatter, laughter )"
S07E02,Stormborn,529,They say her dragons are bigger than Aegon's.
S07E02,Stormborn,530,Horseshit. Cersei's just trying to frighten us.
S07E02,Stormborn,531,I hope it's true.
S07E02,Stormborn,532,"If she lays siege to King's Landing, prices will triple."
S07E02,Stormborn,533,As long as we get back there before they start.
S07E02,Stormborn,534,One more round. It's a long ride.
S07E02,Stormborn,535,Hot Pie: Arry!
S07E02,Stormborn,536,"Hello, Hot Pie."
S07E02,Stormborn,537,Sit down.
S07E02,Stormborn,538,Who's that for?
S07E02,Stormborn,539,Mm. This is good.
S07E02,Stormborn,540,You think so?
S07E02,Stormborn,541,The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.
S07E02,Stormborn,542,Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.
S07E02,Stormborn,543,"Mm, I didn't do that."
S07E02,Stormborn,544,You've been making pies?
S07E02,Stormborn,545,One or two.
S07E02,Stormborn,546,I can't believe you're here.
S07E02,Stormborn,547,Did you meet the big lady?
S07E02,Stormborn,548,- Big lady? - The lady knight?
S07E02,Stormborn,549,"You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on."
S07E02,Stormborn,550,"She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you."
S07E02,Stormborn,551,Did she ever find you?
S07E02,Stormborn,552,She found me.
S07E02,Stormborn,553,"What happened to you, Arry?"
S07E02,Stormborn,554,You got any ale?
S07E02,Stormborn,555,( pouring )
S07E02,Stormborn,556,- Where you heading? - King's Landing.
S07E02,Stormborn,557,- Why? - Heard Cersei's queen now.
S07E02,Stormborn,558,Heard she blew up the Great Sept.
S07E02,Stormborn,559,That must have been something to see.
S07E02,Stormborn,560,- Boom. - Mm.
S07E02,Stormborn,561,I can't believe someone would do that.
S07E02,Stormborn,562,Cersei would do that.
S07E02,Stormborn,563,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
S07E02,Stormborn,564,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
S07E02,Stormborn,565,"No, the Boltons are dead."
S07E02,Stormborn,566,What?
S07E02,Stormborn,567,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a wildling army
S07E02,Stormborn,568,and won the Battle of the Bastards.
S07E02,Stormborn,569,He's King of the North now.
S07E02,Stormborn,570,You're lying.
S07E02,Stormborn,571,Why would I lie about that?
S07E02,Stormborn,572,"He's your brother, right?"
S07E02,Stormborn,573,- Thanks for the pie. - ( coins jingling )
S07E02,Stormborn,574,Friends don't pay.
S07E02,Stormborn,575,Can't believe I thought you were a boy.
S07E02,Stormborn,576,You're pretty.
S07E02,Stormborn,577,Thanks.
S07E02,Stormborn,578,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie."
S07E02,Stormborn,579,Try not to get killed.
S07E02,Stormborn,580,"Ah, I won't."
S07E02,Stormborn,581,"I'm like you, Arry."
S07E02,Stormborn,582,( sniffs ) I'm a survivor.
S07E02,Stormborn,583,200 miles to King's Landing.
S07E02,Stormborn,584,One bottle of rum. You think we'll make it?
S07E02,Stormborn,585,( grunts )
S07E02,Stormborn,586,( knocking on door )
S07E02,Stormborn,587,Come in.
S07E02,Stormborn,588,"A raven, my king, from the Citadel."
S07E02,Stormborn,589,Jon: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly.
S07E02,Stormborn,590,"He was my brother at the Night's Watch,"
S07E02,Stormborn,591,a man I trust as much as anyone in this world.
S07E02,Stormborn,592,He's discovered proof that Dragonstone
S07E02,Stormborn,593,sits on a mountain of dragonglass.
S07E02,Stormborn,594,( all murmuring )
S07E02,Stormborn,595,I received this a few days ago
S07E02,Stormborn,596,from Dragonstone.
S07E02,Stormborn,597,It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
S07E02,Stormborn,598,( all murmuring )
S07E02,Stormborn,599,He is now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.
S07E02,Stormborn,600,She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.
S07E02,Stormborn,601,She has a powerful army at her back
S07E02,Stormborn,602,"and, if this message is to be believed,"
S07E02,Stormborn,603,three dragons.
S07E02,Stormborn,604,( all murmuring )
S07E02,Stormborn,605,Jon: Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone
S07E02,Stormborn,606,to meet with Daenerys.
S07E02,Stormborn,607,And I'm going to accept.
S07E02,Stormborn,608,- ( all shouting ) - Man: Accept?!
S07E02,Stormborn,609,"We need this dragonglass, my lords!"
S07E02,Stormborn,610,We know that dragonglass can destroy
S07E02,Stormborn,611,both white walkers and their army.
S07E02,Stormborn,612,We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.
S07E02,Stormborn,613,"But more importantly, we need allies!"
S07E02,Stormborn,614,The Night King's army grows larger by the day.
S07E02,Stormborn,615,We can't defeat them on our own.
S07E02,Stormborn,616,We don't have the numbers.
S07E02,Stormborn,617,Daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire.
S07E02,Stormborn,618,I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.
S07E02,Stormborn,619,"Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow,"
S07E02,Stormborn,620,then sail for Dragonstone.
S07E02,Stormborn,621,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?
S07E02,Stormborn,622,The Mad King invited him to King's Landing
S07E02,Stormborn,623,- and roasted him alive. - I know that.
S07E02,Stormborn,624,She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.
S07E02,Stormborn,625,The North is one of those seven kingdoms.
S07E02,Stormborn,626,This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.
S07E02,Stormborn,627,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that."
S07E02,Stormborn,628,You know him. He's a good man.
S07E02,Stormborn,629,"Your Grace, with respect, I must agree with Lady Sansa."
S07E02,Stormborn,630,I remember the Mad King all too well.
S07E02,Stormborn,631,A Targaryen cannot be trusted.
S07E02,Stormborn,632,- Nor can a Lannister. - All: Yeah!
S07E02,Stormborn,633,Aye. We called your brother king.
S07E02,Stormborn,634,And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.
S07E02,Stormborn,635,"Winter is here, Your Grace."
S07E02,Stormborn,636,We need the King in the North in the North.
S07E02,Stormborn,637,- Men: Aye! - ( pounding tables )
S07E02,Stormborn,638,You all crowned me your king.
S07E02,Stormborn,639,I never wanted it.
S07E02,Stormborn,640,I never asked for it.
S07E02,Stormborn,641,But I accepted it because the North is my home.
S07E02,Stormborn,642,"It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it,"
S07E02,Stormborn,643,no matter the odds.
S07E02,Stormborn,644,But the odds are against us.
S07E02,Stormborn,645,None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you.
S07E02,Stormborn,646,We can never hope to defeat them alone.
S07E02,Stormborn,647,"We need allies, powerful allies."
S07E02,Stormborn,648,I know it's a risk.
S07E02,Stormborn,649,But I have to take it.
S07E02,Stormborn,650,Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
S07E02,Stormborn,651,Daenerys is a queen.
S07E02,Stormborn,652,Only a king can convince her to help us.
S07E02,Stormborn,653,It has to be me.
S07E02,Stormborn,654,You're abandoning your people!
S07E02,Stormborn,655,You're abandoning your home.
S07E02,Stormborn,656,I'm leaving both in good hands.
S07E02,Stormborn,657,- Whose? - Yours.
S07E02,Stormborn,658,You are my sister.
S07E02,Stormborn,659,You're the only Stark in Winterfell.
S07E02,Stormborn,660,"Until I return, the North is yours."
S07E02,Stormborn,661,Littlefinger: I delivered his bones myself.
S07E02,Stormborn,662,Presented them to Lady Catelyn
S07E02,Stormborn,663,as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.
S07E02,Stormborn,664,Seems like a lifetime ago.
S07E02,Stormborn,665,Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
S07E02,Stormborn,666,I was sorry when he died.
S07E02,Stormborn,667,"Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much."
S07E02,Stormborn,668,So did I.
S07E02,Stormborn,669,"She wasn't fond of you, was she?"
S07E02,Stormborn,670,"Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you."
S07E02,Stormborn,671,"Your father and brothers are gone,"
S07E02,Stormborn,672,"yet here you stand, King in the North."
S07E02,Stormborn,673,Last best hope against the coming storm.
S07E02,Stormborn,674,You don't belong down here.
S07E02,Stormborn,675,Forgive me.
S07E02,Stormborn,676,We haven't ever talked... properly.
S07E02,Stormborn,677,I wanted to remedy that.
S07E02,Stormborn,678,I have nothing to say to you.
S07E02,Stormborn,679,"Not even ""thank you""?"
S07E02,Stormborn,680,"If it weren't for me, you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield."
S07E02,Stormborn,681,"You have many enemies, my king, but I swear to you, I'm not one of them."
S07E02,Stormborn,682,"I love Sansa,"
S07E02,Stormborn,683,as I loved her mother.
S07E02,Stormborn,684,( grunts )
S07E02,Stormborn,685,( choking )

S07E02,Stormborn,715,Come with me.
S07E02,Stormborn,716,Come with me.
S07E02,Stormborn,717,That's not you.

S07E02,Stormborn,722,She's not my mama.
S07E02,Stormborn,723,You can have Cersei.
S07E02,Stormborn,724,I want the Mountain.
S07E02,Stormborn,725,The Mountain killed Father.
S07E02,Stormborn,726,He'll crush you with one hand.
S07E02,Stormborn,727,Father got careless. That's what Mama says.
S07E02,Stormborn,728,Will you shut up about Mama?

S07E02,Stormborn,730,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.

S07E02,Stormborn,734,"When we reach Sunspear,"
S07E02,Stormborn,735,I'll treat you to a Dornish red.
S07E02,Stormborn,736,The best in the world.
S07E02,Stormborn,737,Have you ever been to Dorne?
S07E02,Stormborn,738,A few times.
S07E02,Stormborn,739,Never stayed long.
S07E02,Stormborn,740,A boy in every port?
S07E02,Stormborn,741,"A boy, a girl."
S07E02,Stormborn,742,Depends on the port.
S07E02,Stormborn,743,Could we get some more?
S07E02,Stormborn,744,I thought it wasn't for you.
S07E02,Stormborn,745,I'm developing a taste for it.
S07E02,Stormborn,746,- He's not your servant. - It's fine.
S07E02,Stormborn,747,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
S07E02,Stormborn,748,Once I kill my uncle.
S07E02,Stormborn,749,"And what will you be, handsome?"
S07E02,Stormborn,750,Whatever my queen commands.
S07E02,Stormborn,751,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
S07E02,Stormborn,752,"Oh, I see."
S07E02,Stormborn,753,Your protector.
S07E02,Stormborn,754,"So, if someone gets too close to you..."
S07E02,Stormborn,755,He might have to intervene.
S07E02,Stormborn,756,To hold that person back.
S07E02,Stormborn,757,Until they've made their intentions known.
S07E02,Stormborn,758,"Why are you standing all the way over there, then?"
S07E02,Stormborn,759,A foreign invasion is underway.
S07E02,Stormborn,760,Leave him be.
S07E02,Stormborn,761,Seems like you don't need a protector.
S07E02,Stormborn,762,- ( crashing ) - ( men shouting )
S07E02,Stormborn,763,Stay here.
S07E02,Stormborn,764,- ( all shouting ) - Man: We're under attack!

S07E02,Stormborn,795,( screams )
S07E02,Stormborn,796,Kill us.

S07E02,Stormborn,800,Give your uncle a kiss.

S07E02,Stormborn,803,Euron: Little Theon!
S07E02,Stormborn,804,"Ah, come on, you cockless coward."
S07E02,Stormborn,805,I have her.
S07E02,Stormborn,806,Come and get her.
S07E02,Stormborn,807,( screaming echoes )

S07E03,The Queen's Justice,1,I wish you all the happiness in the world.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,2,- JAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella? - (PANTING)
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,3,Myrcella?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,4,(SCREAMS)
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,5,Kill us!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,6,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,7,Please try not to scream.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,8,(GRUNTING)
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,9,MEERA REED: This is Brandon Stark.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,10,Son of Ned Stark.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,11,Let's get them inside.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,12,"TYRION LANNISTER: For decades, House Lannister"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,13,"has been the true power in Westeros,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,14,and the feat of that power is Casterly Rock.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,15,"Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,16,and take it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,17,Summon Jon Snow.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,18,TYRION: He would make a valuable ally.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,19,MELISANDRE: Let him stand before you and tell you the things
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,20,that have happened to him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,21,Dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,22,We can never hope to defeat the army of the dead alone.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,23,We need allies.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,24,You're abandoning your people! You're abandoning your home.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,25,"Until I return, the North is yours."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,26,( theme music playing )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,27,The bastard of Winterfell.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,28,The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,29,I believe we last saw each other atop the Wall.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,30,You were pissing off the edge if I remember right.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,31,Picked up some scars along the road.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,32,"It's been a long road, but we're both still here."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,33,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,34,"- Davos Seaworth. - Ah, the Onion Knight."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,35,We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,36,Unluckily for me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,37,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,38,Welcome to Dragonstone.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,39,Our queen knows it is a long journey.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,40,She appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,41,If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,42,Of course.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,43,( men murmuring )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,44,"Please, this way."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,45,Where are you from?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,46,I can't place the accent.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,47,I was born on the Island of Naath.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,48,Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,49,Palm trees and butterflies.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,50,"Haven't been, myself."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,51,This place has changed.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,52,Tyrion: And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,53,- Jon: She is. - Does she miss me terribly?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,54,A sham marriage. And unconsummated.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,55,"- I didn't ask. - Well, it was. Wasn't."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,56,Anyway...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,57,she's much smarter than she lets on.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,58,She's starting to let on.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,59,Good.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,60,"Tyrion: At some point,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,61,I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit became King in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,62,As long as you tell me how a Lannister
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,63,became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,64,A long and bloody tale.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,65,"To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,66,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,67,Of course they do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,68,"If I was your Hand, I would have advised against it."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,69,General rule of thumb--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,70,Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,71,True...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,72,but I'm not a Stark.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,73,( screeching )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,74,( panting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,75,I'd say you get used to them...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,76,but you never really do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,77,"Come, their mother is waiting for you."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,78,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,79,You begged us to summon the King in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,80,Don't you want to see him again?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,81,I've done my part.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,82,I've brought ice and fire together.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,83,Strange.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,84,"You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,85,"but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,86,I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,87,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,88,"Oh, I doubt that."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,89,"Give us common folk one taste of power,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,90,we're like the lion who tasted man.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,91,Nothing is ever so sweet again.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,92,Neither of us is common folk anymore.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,93,I did not part on good terms
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,94,with the King in the North or his advisor.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,95,Why?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,96,Because of mistakes I made.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,97,Terrible mistakes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,98,I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,99,"- So, where will you go? - Volantis."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,100,Good.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,101,"If you don't mind my saying,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,102,I don't think you should return to Westeros.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,103,I'm not sure you'd be safe here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,104,"Oh, I will return, dear Spider."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,105,- One last time. - My lady--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,106,I have to die in this strange country.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,107,Just like you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,108,Missandei: You stand in the presence
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,109,"of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,110,"rightful heir to the Iron Throne,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,111,"rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,112,"Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,113,"the Mother of Dragons,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,114,"the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,115,"the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,116,This is Jon Snow.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,117,He's King in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,118,"Thank you for traveling so far, my lord."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,119,I hope the seas weren't too rough.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,120,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,121,"Apologies, I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,122,"but Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,123,- He's not a lord. - Forgive me--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,124,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,125,"Forgive me, Ser Davos."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,126,"I never did receive a formal education,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,127,but I could have sworn I read
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,128,"the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,129,"who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,130,"In exchange for his life and the lives of the Northmen,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,131,Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,132,Or do I have my facts wrong?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,133,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,134,"No, of course not."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,135,"But still, an oath is an oath."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,136,And perpetuity means--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,137,"what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,138,Forever.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,139,Forever.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,140,"- So I assume, my lord... - ( sighs )"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,141,...you're here to bend the knee.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,142,I am not.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,143,Oh.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,144,"Well, that is unfortunate."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,145,You've traveled all this way
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,146,to break faith with House Targaryen?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,147,Break faith?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,148,Your father burned my grandfather alive.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,149,He burned my uncle alive.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,150,He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,151,My father... was an evil man.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,152,On behalf of House Targaryen...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,153,I ask your forgiveness
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,154,for the crimes he committed against your family.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,155,And I ask you not to judge a daughter
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,156,by the sins of her father.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,157,"Our two houses were allies for centuries,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,158,and those were the best centuries
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,159,the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,160,Centuries of peace and prosperity
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,161,with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,162,and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,163,"I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,164,Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,165,Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,166,"Together, we will save this country"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,167,from those who would destroy it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,168,You're right.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,169,You're not guilty of your father's crimes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,170,And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,171,Then why are you here?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,172,"Because I need your help, and you need mine."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,173,Did you see three dragons
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,174,flying overhead when you arrived?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,175,I did.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,176,"And did you see the Dothraki,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,177,all of whom have sworn to kill for me?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,178,They're hard to miss.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,179,"- But still, I need your help? - Davos: Not to defeat Cersei."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,180,You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,181,"Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,182,- Almost. - But you haven't stormed King's Landing.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,183,Why not?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,184,The only reason I can see
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,185,is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,186,"It's the fastest way to win the war,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,187,"but you won't do it,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,188,"which means, at the very least,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,189,you're better than Cersei.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,190,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,191,"Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,192,"we're children playing at a game,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,193,screaming that the rules aren't fair.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,194,- You told me you liked this man. - I do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,195,"In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,196,"he's refused to bow, and now he's calling me a child."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,197,I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,198,"Your Grace, everyone you know will die before winter's over"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,199,if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,200,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,201,I am not your enemy.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,202,The dead are the enemy.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,203,The dead?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,204,Is that another figure of speech?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,205,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,206,The Army of the Dead?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,207,"You don't know me well, my lord,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,208,but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,209,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,210,The Army of the Dead is real.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,211,The white walkers are real.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,212,The Night King is real. I've seen them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,213,If they get past the Wall
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,214,and we're squabbling amongst ourselves...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,215,we're finished.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,216,I was born at Dragonstone.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,217,Not that I can remember it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,218,We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,219,"Robert was your father's best friend, no?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,220,I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,221,to murder a baby girl in her crib.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,222,"Not that it matters now, of course."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,223,I spent my life in foreign lands.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,224,"So many men have tried to kill me,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,225,I don't remember all their names.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,226,I have been sold like a broodmare.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,227,"I've been chained and betrayed,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,228,raped and defiled.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,229,Do you know what kept me standing
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,230,through all those years in exile?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,231,Faith.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,232,"Not in any gods,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,233,not in myths and legends.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,234,In myself.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,235,In Daenerys Targaryen.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,236,The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,237,until my children were born.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,238,"The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,239,They did for me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,240,"I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,241,and I will.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,242,You'll be ruling over a graveyard
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,243,if we don't defeat the Night King.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,244,The war against my sister has already begun.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,245,You can't expect us to halt hostilities
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,246,and join you in fighting
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,247,whatever you saw beyond the Wall.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,248,You don't believe him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,249,I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,250,"But if destiny has brought Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,251,it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,252,You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,253,He is the first to make allies of wildlings and Northmen.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,254,He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,255,He was named King in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,256,Not because of his birthright.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,257,He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,258,All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,259,because they believe in him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,260,"All those things you don't believe in,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,261,he faced those things.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,262,He fought those things for the good of his people.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,263,He risked his life for his people.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,264,He took a knife in the heart for his people.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,265,He gave his own--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,266,"If we don't put aside our enmities and band together,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,267,we will die.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,268,And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,269,"If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,270,"Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,271,"help her to defeat my sister,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,272,"and together, our armies will protect the North."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,273,There's no time for that.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,274,There's no time for any of this!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,275,"While we stand here, debating--"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,276,It takes no time to bend the knee.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,277,Pledge your sword to her cause.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,278,And why would I do that?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,279,"I mean no offense, Your Grace,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,280,but I don't know you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,281,"As far as I can tell,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,282,"your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,283,and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,284,The lords of the North
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,285,"placed their trust in me to lead them,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,286,and I will continue to do so as well as I can.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,287,That's fair.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,288,It's also fair to point out
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,289,that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,290,"By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,291,you are in open rebellion.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,292,( footsteps approaching )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,293,"( whispering ) Your Grace, please dismiss your guests."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,294,I have grave news.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,295,You must forgive my manners.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,296,You'll both be tired after your long journey.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,297,We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,298,( speaking Dothraki )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,299,Am I your prisoner?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,300,Not yet.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,301,Our ironborn and Dornish allies
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,302,were attacked en route to Dorne.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,303,"- And? - Two or three ships escaped,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,304,"the rest, sunk or captured."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,305,"Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, dead or captured."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,306,"The Greyjoys, dead or captured."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,307,All of them?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,308,( men shouting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,309,- Pull! - Heave!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,310,Pull!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,311,( men grunt )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,312,( grunts )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,313,Your sister's dead?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,314,Euron has her.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,315,You saw him take her?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,316,- But you got away? - I couldn't save her.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,317,I tried.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,318,You wouldn't be here if you tried.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,319,"Man: Come, men!"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,320,Sails up!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,321,( crowd cheering )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,322,Woman: Murderer!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,323,Man: Whores!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,324,- ( all shouting ) - Traitor!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,325,This is the life.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,326,"Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,327,( cheering )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,328,- ( grunts ) - ( laughter )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,329,"I have to be honest,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,330,this is making me hard.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,331,Did you see Little Theon's face
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,332,right before he jumped overboard?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,333,"""Oh, no!"" ( laughs )"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,334,What a twat.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,335,( crowd booing )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,336,- ( crowd shouting ) - ( spits )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,337,- Man: Whore! Whore! Whore! - Man ♪2: Murderers!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,338,( applause )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,339,( grunts )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,340,"My queen, please accept this gift"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,341,on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,342,"( both grunt, gasp )"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,343,I give you what no other man could give--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,344,justice.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,345,Justice for your murdered daughter.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,346,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,347,and a true friend to the crown.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,348,You deserve more than a true friend.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,349,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,350,There's only one reward I want.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,351,You shall have what your heart desires...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,352,when the war is won.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,353,With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,354,"and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,355,the sons and daughters of Westeros
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,356,shall defend our country.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,357,( crowd cheering )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,358,"There's nothing quite like it, is there?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,359,The love of the people.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,360,Though I suppose you wouldn't know.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,361,This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,362,"And if you turn on us,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,363,they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,364,Or yours.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,365,"They just like severed heads, really."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,366,"Listen, if you have any advice at all,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,367,I would love to hear it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,368,When we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,369,Advice?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,370,Does she like it gentle or rough?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,371,A finger in the bum?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,372,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now. We'll talk later."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,373,Cersei: I want you to know I understand.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,374,"Even though we're enemies, you and I,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,375,I understand the fury that drives you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,376,I was there that day
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,377,when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,378,"If I close my eyes,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,379,- I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking. - ( grunts )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,380,The sound of your scream.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,381,I never heard a sound like that.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,382,"I thought, ""That's true love."""
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,383,Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,384,No one moved like him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,385,No one had such skill with a spear.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,386,Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,387,If only he hadn't taunted him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,388,He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,389,"But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,390,Now he's buried somewhere.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,391,"And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,392,That must be difficult for you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,393,"When my daughter was taken from me,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,394,my only daughter...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,395,"well, you can't imagine how that feels"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,396,unless you've lost a child.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,397,I fed her at my own breast even though they told me
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,398,to give her to the wet nurse.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,399,I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,400,"I never got to have a mother,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,401,but Myrcella did.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,402,"She was mine, and you took her from me."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,403,Why did you do that?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,404,Doesn't matter now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,405,"Your daughter's a beauty, too."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,406,Those brown eyes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,407,Those lips.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,408,Perfect Dornish beauty.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,409,I imagine she's your favorite.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,410,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,411,"but still, we're only human."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,412,We love whom we love.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,413,( muffled speech )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,414,"I'm sorry, I can't understand you."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,415,That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,416,It must be frustrating.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,417,We all make our choices.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,418,You chose to murder my daughter.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,419,You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,420,- ( grunts ) - Do you feel powerful now?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,421,I don't sleep very well.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,422,"Not at all, really."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,423,I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,424,and imagine ways of killing my enemies.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,425,"How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,426,I thought about having Ser Gregor
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,427,crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,428,"It would be poetic, I suppose, but fast, too fast."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,429,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,430,She's so beautiful.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,431,The thought of this lovely face
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,432,"cracking open like a duck egg,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,433,"no, it's just not right."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,434,- ( Tyene whimpers ) - ( gasps )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,435,Mama.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,436,( grunts )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,437,( crying )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,438,Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,439,Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,440,"The Long Goodbye, was that it?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,441,- The Long Farewell. - That's the one.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,442,How long does the poison take?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,443,"Qyburn: Difficult to say-- hours, days."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,444,It depends on the subject's constitution.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,445,"- But death is certain? - Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,446,"Your daughter will die here in this cell,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,447,and you will be here watching when she does.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,448,You'll be here the rest of your days.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,449,"If you refuse to eat, we'll force food down your throat."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,450,You will live to watch your daughter rot.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,451,- To watch that beautiful face collapse... - ( sobbing )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,452,...to bone and dust.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,453,All the while contemplating the choices you've made.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,454,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,455,I don't want her to miss a thing.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,456,( both crying )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,457,No.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,458,( panting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,459,( birds chirping )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,460,( knocking on door )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,461,Don't.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,462,What are you doing? No one can see us like this.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,463,I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,464,"Forgive me, Your Grace."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,465,The visitor from Braavos has arrived.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,466,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,467,"At once, Your Grace."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,468,( chuckles )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,469,( liquid pouring )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,470,"No, thank you."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,471,"My condolences, Your Grace,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,472,on the death of your son.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,473,"From all reports, he was a fine young man."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,474,The Iron Bank didn't send you here to offer condolences.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,475,Condolences and congratulations.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,476,"To become the first ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,477,that's quite an accomplishment.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,478,"The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,479,freeing the crown from elements
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,480,who sought to subvert the rule of law.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,481,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,482,"Indeed, but sometimes tragedies are necessary"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,483,to restore order and rational leadership.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,484,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,485,Your father never minced words either.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,486,"But, yes, your debts are considerable."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,487,And you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,488,We both know how expensive war can be.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,489,And we both know gold wins wars.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,490,Your vaults are empty.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,491,Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,492,"Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,493,You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,494,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,495,We don't make bets.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,496,We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,497,"A fancy way of saying ""bet."""
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,498,The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,499,I decapitated the Dornish snake.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,500,My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,501,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,502,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,503,For now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,504,Daenerys Targaryen has three full-grown dragons.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,505,How well do wooden ships fare against fire-breathing dragons?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,506,Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,507,But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,508,You want to invest in her?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,509,I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,510,How are your profits
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,511,now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,512,"The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,513,"From what I gather, she considers herself"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,514,more of a revolutionary than a monarch.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,515,"In your experience, how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,516,"The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,517,but Lannisters always pay their debts.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,518,Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,519,"Your father's daughter, indeed."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,520,Give me a fortnight.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,521,Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,522,"And when you return to Braavos,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,523,"I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,524,I came down here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,525,You're making it difficult.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,526,You look a lot better brooding than I do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,527,You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,528,I'm a prisoner on this island.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,529,I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,530,"You're free to walk the castle,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,531,"the beaches, to go wherever you want."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,532,Except to my ship.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,533,You took my ship.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,534,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,535,I'm not playing word games with you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,536,The dead are coming for us all.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,537,Why don't you figure out what to do
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,538,"about my missing fleet and murdered allies,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,539,and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,540,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,541,If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,542,You probably don't believe me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,543,"I do, actually."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,544,You didn't before.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,545,"""Grumkins and snarks,"" you called them."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,546,Do you remember?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,547,You said it was all nonsense.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,548,It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,549,But then Mormont saw them
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,550,and you saw them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,551,And I trust the eyes of an honest man
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,552,more than I trust what everybody knows.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,553,How do I convince people who don't know me
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,554,that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,555,- Good question. - I know it's a good question.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,556,I'm looking for an answer.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,557,People's minds aren't made for problems that large.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,558,"White walkers, the Night King,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,559,Army of the Dead--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,560,it's almost a relief to confront
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,561,"a comfortable, familiar monster like my sister."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,562,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,563,I can't help them from here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,564,I'd like to leave.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,565,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,566,by giving up that easily.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,567,Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,568,Don't go south.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,569,"Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,570,a foreign invader.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,571,"And here I am,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,572,a Northern fool.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,573,"Children are not their fathers,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,574,luckily for all of us.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,575,And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,576,and Northern fools than meets the eye.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,577,"Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but she didn't."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,578,"Instead, she stayed where she was"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,579,"and saved many people from horrible fates,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,580,some of whom are on this island with us right now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,581,"While you're our guest here,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,582,you might consider asking them
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,583,what they think of the Mad King's daughter.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,584,"She protects people from monsters,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,585,just as you do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,586,It's why she came here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,587,And she's not about to head north
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,588,to fight an enemy she's never seen
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,589,on the word of a man she doesn't know.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,590,"After a single meeting,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,591,it's not a reasonable thing to ask.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,592,"So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,593,What do you mean?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,594,Maybe you are a Northern fool.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,595,I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,596,- Dragonglass? - Tyrion: Yes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,597,"Volcanic glass, obsidian."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,598,He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,599,Why are we talking about glass?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,600,We just lost two of our allies.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,601,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,602,And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,603,"Apparently, it can be turned into weapons"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,604,that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,605,Or stop them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,606,Destroy them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,607,Unsure about the nomenclature.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,608,And what do you think about this Army of the Dead
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,609,and white walkers and Night Kings?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,610,I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,611,But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,612,simply because you want to believe it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,613,Which wise man said this?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,614,I don't remember.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,615,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,616,I would never do that.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,617,To you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,618,The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,619,All of his advisors would have told him not to come.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,620,I would have told him not to come.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,621,And he's here anyway.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,622,You don't have to believe him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,623,Let him mine the dragonglass.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,624,"If he's wrong, it's worthless."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,625,You didn't even know it was here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,626,It's nothing to you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,627,Give him something by giving him nothing.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,628,Take a step toward a more productive relationship
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,629,with a possible ally.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,630,Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,631,Casterly Rock.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,632,What was that Ser Davos said
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,633,about taking a knife in the heart for his people?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,634,Did you notice that?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,635,You must allow them their flights of fancy.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,636,It's dreary in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,637,( screeching )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,638,Amazing thing to see.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,639,"I named them for my brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,640,They're both gone now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,641,You lost two brothers as well.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,642,"People thought dragons were gone forever, but here they are."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,643,Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,644,You've been talking to Tyrion.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,645,He is my Hand.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,646,- He enjoys talking. - We all enjoy what we're good at.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,647,I don't.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,648,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,649,I never expected that you would.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,650,And I haven't changed my mind
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,651,about which kingdoms belong to that throne.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,652,I haven't either.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,653,( sighs )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,654,I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,655,"Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,656,Thank you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,657,"So you believe me, then, about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,658,"You'd better get to work, Jon Snow."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,659,( chatter )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,660,How much do we have?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,661,"4,000 bushels, my lady."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,662,What does that mean?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,663,"For the current occupants of the castle,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,664,"it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,665,And what's the longest winter in the past hundred years?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,666,"Uh, I'm not entirely certain."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,667,I-I'll check Maester Luwin's records.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,668,He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,669,"You're telling me we don't have enough food,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,670,especially not if the armies of the North come back to defend Winterfell?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,671,"No, my lady, most likely not."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,672,Then we must prepare for that eventuality.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,673,"Whatever direction the threat comes from,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,674,this is the best place to be.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,675,We need to start building up our grain stores
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,676,with regular shipments from every keep in the North.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,677,"If we don't use it by winter's end, we'll give it back to them."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,678,"But if the entire North has to flee to Winterfell,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,679,they won't have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,680,"Very wise, my lady."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,681,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,682,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,683,"No, my lady."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,684,"Well, shouldn't they be? Once the real cold comes?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,685,"They should, indeed."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,686,"Pardon me, my lady."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,687,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,688,Command suits you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,689,"The Northerners are all facing north,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,690,worried about the threat from beyond the Wall.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,691,So they should be.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,692,I know Cersei better than anyone here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,693,If you turn your back on her--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,694,- You don't know Cersei better than anyone here. - I only meant to say--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,695,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father, and brother is dangerous?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,696,Thank you for your wise counsel.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,697,One of two things will happen--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,698,"either the dead will defeat the living,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,699,in which case...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,700,"all our troubles come to an end,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,701,or life will win out.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,702,And what then?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,703,Don't fight in the North or the South.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,704,"Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,705,"Everyone is your enemy,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,706,everyone is your friend...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,707,every possible series of events is happening all at once.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,708,Live that way and nothing will surprise you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,709,Everything that happens will be something
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,710,that you've seen before.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,711,"Lady Sansa, at the gate."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,712,( people murmuring )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,713,"Hello, Sansa."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,714,( sobbing )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,715,I wish Jon were here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,716,"Yes, I need to speak to him."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,717,You're Father's last living trueborn son.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,718,You're Lord of Winterfell now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,719,I can never be Lord of Winterfell.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,720,I can never be lord of anything.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,721,I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,722,I don't know what that means.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,723,It's difficult to explain.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,724,"Try. Please, for me."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,725,It means I can see everything.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,726,Everything that's ever happened to everyone.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,727,Everything that's happening right now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,728,"It's all pieces now, fragments."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,729,I need to learn to see better.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,730,"When the Long Night comes again,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,731,I need to be ready.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,732,How do you know all this?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,733,The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,734,I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,735,I told you it's difficult to explain.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,736,( sighs )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,737,Bran--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,738,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,739,I'm sorry it had to happen here in our home.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,740,It was so beautiful that night.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,741,"Snow falling, just like now."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,742,And you were so beautiful...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,743,in your white wedding dress.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,744,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,745,I'll stay a bit longer.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,746,( man coughing in distance )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,747,Hmm.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,748,Hmm.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,749,Does it hurt?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,750,A bit. Less than before.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,751,The infection no longer appears to be active.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,752,( sighs )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,753,Unusual.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,754,Unlikely.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,755,One could almost be forgiven
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,756,for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,757,and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,758,Don't know anything about that.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,759,I just started feeling better.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,760,I assumed it was the rest that did it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,761,And the climate.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,762,The climate.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,763,"You're free to go, ser."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,764,"This chamber is needed for the infectious,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,765,which you are no longer.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,766,"Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,767,How bad is it?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,768,Suppose I'll find out this evening.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,769,- Where will you go? - ( grunts )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,770,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,771,I knew it would kill me
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,772,or I'd kill myself before it could.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,773,Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,774,The only place for me is back with her.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,775,I owe her my life.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,776,Her and you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,777,( chuckles )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,778,Your father saved me more than once.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,779,It's the least I could do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,780,Perhaps our paths will cross again.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,781,I hope they do.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,782,- Ebrose: You treated him? - Yes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,783,Who told you to treat him?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,784,No one.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,785,"Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,786,I seem to remember you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,787,"- But you treated him anyway? - I did, yes."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,788,"I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,789,especially on someone of that age.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,790,You could have infected yourself and others.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,791,You could have devastated the entire Citadel.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,792,But you didn't.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,793,"It's a meticulous, difficult procedure."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,794,Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,795,have attempted it and failed.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,796,Yet you succeeded.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,797,How?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,798,I read the books and followed the instructions.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,799,That man is alive because of you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,800,You should be proud.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,801,"Thank you, Archmaester."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,802,Come here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,803,All these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,804,I need you to make copies of them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,805,You were expecting a reward.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,806,Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,807,You'd better get started.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,808,And careful of the paper mites.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,809,They like flesh as well.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,810,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,811,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,812,To send our remaining ships after him--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,813,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,814,Would you have to go yourself?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,815,Euron's ships could be anywhere
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,816,or in more than one place.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,817,You'd be flying around the open seas alone
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,818,for who knows how long.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,819,I wouldn't be alone.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,820,"I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,821,What can anyone do to them?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,822,Missandei: They can still do something to you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,823,It only takes one arrow.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,824,It's too great a risk. You're too important.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,825,What about Casterly Rock?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,826,The Unsullied will be there soon.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,827,And what will they face?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,828,A difficult situation.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,829,They know we're coming.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,830,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,831,is to destroy House Lannister.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,832,She will be ready.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,833,- No one has ever taken the Rock. - Man: Archers!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,834,Tyrion: The Lannister Army is still the army my father built.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,835,- Come on! - Tyrion: Well-trained and well-provisioned.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,836,"10,000 men at least."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,837,They will see us coming.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,838,They will be ready.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,839,( men shouting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,840,- Man: Draw! Loose! - Man ♪2: Loose!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,841,Tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,842,( men grunting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,843,The fight up the walls will be hard.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,844,We will be at a disadvantage.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,845,- ( grunts ) - Many men will die.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,846,Just as my father said they would.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,847,Interesting thing about my father--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,848,he built our house up from near ruin.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,849,"He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,850,but he didn't build the sewers.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,851,"That was beneath him,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,852,so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,853,me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,854,"He was right, I was low."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,855,"The company I kept, low."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,856,"Women, mostly."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,857,They weren't welcome at the Rock.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,858,Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,859,"Couldn't walk them through the front gates,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,860,"I couldn't have them in my chambers,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,861,"so in the process of building the sewers,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,862,I threw in something for myself.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,863,It was a passage that began
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,864,in an out of the way cove by the sea
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,865,and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,866,No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,867,Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,868,"( grunts, wheezes )"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,869,"But as a good friend of mine once said,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,870,"""Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,871,- ( grunting ) - ( all shouting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,872,And so it begins.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,873,They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,874,They will be outnumbered.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,875,They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,876,But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,877,The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,878,They will be fighting for freedom
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,879,and the person who gave it to them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,880,They will be fighting for you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,881,And that is why they will triumph.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,882,( speaking Valyrian )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,883,( Grey Worm speaking Valyrian )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,884,( distant explosions )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,885,Where are they?!
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,886,Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,887,( men shouting )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,888,( chatter )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,889,( door opens )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,890,- It's done. - It is.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,891,And now the rains weep o'er our halls.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,892,Did we fight well?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,893,"Uh, as well as could be expected."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,894,It was never our forte.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,895,"Golden roses, indeed."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,896,Your brother and his new queen
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,897,thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,898,The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,899,"Well, it is to me,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,900,but my fond childhood memories
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,901,won't keep Cersei on the throne.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,902,So you just let them take it?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,903,For now. They won't be able to hold it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,904,"Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,905,we emptied the larders before we left.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,906,"Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,907,and march all the way across Westeros.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,908,"And you took your army, your real army,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,909,and went where they weren't.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,910,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,911,There are always lessons in failures.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,912,Yes. You must be very wise by now.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,913,My father always said I was a slow learner.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,914,"If he was so clever,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,915,why didn't he take Highgarden
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,916,the moment your gold mines ran dry?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,917,( scoffs )
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,918,I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,919,"No more learning from my mistakes, eh?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,920,How will you do it?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,921,With that sword?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,922,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,923,Not that he ever used it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,924,What did he call it?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,925,Widow's Wail.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,926,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,927,I did unspeakable things to protect my family.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,928,Or watched them being done on my orders.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,929,I never lost a night's sleep over them.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,930,They were necessary.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,931,And whatever I imagined necessary
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,932,"for the safety of House Tyrell, I did."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,933,But your sister has done things...
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,934,I was incapable of imagining.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,935,That was my prize mistake--
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,936,a failure of imagination.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,937,"She's a monster, you do know that?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,938,"To you, I'm sure."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,939,To others as well.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,940,"But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,941,"when people are living peacefully in the world she built,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,942,do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,943,You love her.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,944,You really do love her.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,945,You poor fool.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,946,She'll be the end of you.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,947,Possibly.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,948,Not much to be gained
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,949,"from discussing it with you, though, is there?"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,950,What better person to discuss it with?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,951,What better guarantee could you have
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,952,that the things you say will never leave this room?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,953,But perhaps you're right.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,954,"If she's driven you this far,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,955,it's gone beyond your control.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,956,Yes.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,957,It has.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,958,She's a disease.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,959,I regret my role in spreading it.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,960,"You will, too."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,961,I think we're done here.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,962,How will it happen?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,963,Cersei had several ideas.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,964,Whipping you through the streets
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,965,and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,966,Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,967,I talked her out of those.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,968,Will there be pain?
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,969,No. I made sure of that.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,970,That's good.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,971,I'd hate to die like your son.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,972,"Clawing at my neck,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,973,"foam and bile spilling from my mouth,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,974,"eyes bloodred, skin purple."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,975,"Must have been horrible for you,"
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,976,"as a Kingsguard, as a father."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,977,It was horrible enough for me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,978,A shocking scene.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,979,Not at all what I intended.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,980,"You see, I had never seen the poison work before."
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,981,Tell Cersei.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,982,I want her to know it was me.
S07E03,The Queen's Justice,983,( music playing )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,1,(GRUNTING)
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,2,I lost this dagger.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,3,To whom?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,4,Tyrion Lannister.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,5,Take a step toward a more productive relationship
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,6,with a possible ally.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,7,I will allow you to mine the dragonglass
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,8,and forge weapons from it.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,9,Thank you.

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,11,How do you propose to stop them?

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,17,with a wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,18,He's King of the North now.

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,20,COMMANDER: Your sister's dead.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,21,THEON: Euron has her.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,22,I couldn't save her. I tried.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,23,You wouldn't be here if you'd tried.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,24,What about Casterly Rock?

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,26,(GRUNTING)
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,27,TYCHO NESTORIS: We both know how expensive war can be.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,28,Your vaults are empty.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,29,My debt will be paid in full.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,30,How will it happen?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,31,Will there be pain?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,32,"JAIME: No, I'll make sure of that."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,33,I'd hate to die like your son.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,34,Not at all what I intended.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,35,Tell Cersei.

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,41,You've just won the biggest prize in the world.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,42,What could you possibly have to be upset about?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,43,"Come on, you can tell me."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,44,Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,45,before saying goodbye?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,46,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,47,There is no more High Septon.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,48,"No, there isn't, is there?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,49,There is still the question of my prize.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,50,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,51,It's not a castle.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,52,How about that one? It's available.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,53,You don't want Highgarden.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,54,- I beg to differ. - We're at war.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,55,Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,56,"Besides, think of the upkeep."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,57,"The more you owe, the more it weighs you down."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,58,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,59,All your new riches weighing you down?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,60,- Man: Move out! - Jaime: They're not mine.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,61,This all belongs to the Iron Bank.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,62,See? We pay our debts.

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,70,"will be yours to choose from,"

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,72,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,73,will be quiet and peaceable.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,74,"Ah, stranger things have happened."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,75,Like what?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,76,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,77,- The current harvest? - We have teams of men collecting it
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,78,from all the farms in the Reach.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,79,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,80,and help them accelerate this process?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,81,I'm not much for shoveling wheat.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,82,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest--"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,83,I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,84,My lord.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,85,My lord.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,86,My lord.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,87,"Tycho: I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,88,has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,89,"I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,90,but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,91,"You're too kind, my lord."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,92,"I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,93,I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,94,"Its well-being is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,95,And the current arithmetic is outstanding.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,96,"- Uh, the gold... - Is on its way."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,97,My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,98,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,99,They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,100,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,101,"Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,102,in some current venture.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,103,My only venture at this moment
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,104,is reestablishing control over this continent
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,105,and every person on it.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,106,I see a great deal of potential in that venture.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,107,I imagine it would require outside investment.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,108,"It will, indeed."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,109,"I need to expand my armies, my navies."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,110,"My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,111,I know them well.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,112,They have helped us recover significant sums
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,113,from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,114,That's good to hear.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,115,"I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,116,"Rest assured, Your Grace,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,117,you can count on the Iron Bank's support.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,118,- Hmm. - As soon as the gold arrives.

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,123,"The other dagger,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,124,"the one that took her life,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,125,I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,126,if I could have.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,127,I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,128,But I am here for her now
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,129,"to do what she would have done,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,130,to protect her children.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,131,"Anything I can do for you, Brandon,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,132,you need only ask.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,133,Do you know who this belonged to?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,134,No.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,135,That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,136,"In a way, that dagger made you what you are today."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,137,"Forced from your home,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,138,driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,139,I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,140,To go through all of that and make your way home again
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,141,"only to find such chaos in the world,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,142,I can only imagine--

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,145,( exhales )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,146,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,147,I'm not Lord Stark.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,148,What's that?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,149,Maester Wolkan built it for me
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,150,so I can move around more easily.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,151,It's a very good idea.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,152,You're leaving.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,153,"I don't want to leave you,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,154,"but when-- when they come,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,155,I need to be with my family.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,156,And you're safe.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,157,"Well, as safe as anyone can be now."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,158,You don't need me anymore.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,159,"No, I don't."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,160,That's all you've got to say?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,161,Thank you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,162,Thank you?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,163,For helping me.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,164,My brother died for you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,165,Hodor and Summer died for you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,166,I almost died for you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,167,"- Bran... - I'm not, really."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,168,Not anymore.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,169,( crying )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,170,"I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,171,but I remember so much else now.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,172,You died in that cave.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,173,I did.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,174,"The kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,175,The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,176,'Ey up. Where you going?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,177,In there. I live here.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,178,( snickers ) Fuck off.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,179,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,180,( Henk snorts )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,181,Arya Stark's dead.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,182,Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrick.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,183,- They'll tell you who I am. - There's no Rodrick here.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,184,Maester's named Wolkan.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,185,"Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,186,- He's my brother. - He's a thousand miles away.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,187,"Look, it's cold and we're busy,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,188,"- so, you know, best fuck off. - Mm."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,189,"If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,190,The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,191,- Which Lady Stark? - Henk: You tell us.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,192,You're the one impersonating her sister.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,193,Tell Sansa her sister's home.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,194,"Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,195,"So, for the last time, fuck off."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,196,( grunts )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,197,I'm getting into this castle one way or another.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,198,"If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,199,But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away...
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,200,"Right, you sit there."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,201,Right there.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,202,Don't move.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,203,"Right, go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,204,Henk: I ain't telling Lady Stark. You can tell her.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,205,Koner: Why me?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,206,- Henk: You're gonna tell her. - I'm not.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,207,"'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,208,as hard as I can.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,209,Koner: We told her to wait.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,210,"( sighs ) We were standing right next to her, and..."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,211,"And-- and when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,212,She-- she was nothing. Some winter town girl.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,213,"She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrick..."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,214,"- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah. - ...and Maester Luwin."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,215,"( Henk stammering ) And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,216,- We'll-- we'll find her. - You don't have to.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,217,I know where she is.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,218,( fire crackling )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,219,( chain rattling )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,220,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,221,Yes.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,222,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,223,I didn't run.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,224,You need better guards.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,225,( chuckles )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,226,It suits you... Lady Stark.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,227,Jon left you in charge?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,228,He did.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,229,I hope he comes back soon.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,230,I remember how happy he was to see me.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,231,"When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,232,( chuckles )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,233,It doesn't look like him.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,234,Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,235,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,236,We're not.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,237,They say you killed Joffrey.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,238,Did you?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,239,I wish I had.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,240,"Hmm. Me, too."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,241,I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,242,"However long my list got, he was always first."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,243,Your list?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,244,Of people I'm going to kill.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,245,How did you get back to Winterfell?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,246,It's a long story.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,247,"I imagine yours is, too."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,248,Yes.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,249,Not a very pleasant one.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,250,Mine neither.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,251,But our stories aren't over yet.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,252,"No, they're not."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,253,Arya...
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,254,"Bran's home, too."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,255,( crows cawing )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,256,You came home.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,257,I saw you at the crossroads.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,258,You saw me?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,259,I see quite a lot now.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,260,Bran has... visions.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,261,I thought you might go to King's Landing.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,262,So did I.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,263,Why would you go back there?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,264,Cersei's on her list of names.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,265,Who else is on your list?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,266,Most of them are dead already.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,267,Where did you get this?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,268,Littlefinger gave it to me.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,269,Littlefinger? He's here?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,270,He has declared for House Stark.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,271,Why would he give you a dagger?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,272,- He thought I'd want it. - Sansa: Why?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,273,Because it was meant to kill me.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,274,The cutthroat... after your fall?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,275,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,276,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,277,He's not a generous man.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,278,He wouldn't give you anything
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,279,unless he thought he was getting something back.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,280,- It doesn't matter. - What do you mean it doesn't matter?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,281,I don't want it.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,282,Are you sure?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,283,Arya: It's Valyrian steel.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,284,It's wasted on a cripple.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,285,( people chattering )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,286,( bleating )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,287,Catelyn Stark would be proud.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,288,You kept your vow.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,289,I did next to nothing.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,290,"You're too hard on yourself, my lady."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,291,I'm not a...
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,292,"Thank you, Podrick."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,293,( raven cawing )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,294,( waves crashing )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,295,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,296,Soon.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,297,He will come back to you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,298,He'd better.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,299,What happened?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,300,Many things.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,301,Many things?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,302,- ( sighs ) - Jon: Your Grace.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,303,( speaks Dothraki )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,304,( seagulls screeching )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,305,I wanted you to see it
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,306,before we start hacking it to bits.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,307,"Well, this is it. All we'll ever need."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,308,"There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,309,The children of the forest made these.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,310,When?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,311,A very long time ago.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,312,"They were right here,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,313,standing where we're standing.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,314,Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,315,Maybe even before there were men.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,316,No.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,317,"They were here together, the children and the First Men."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,318,Doing what? Fighting each other?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,319,They fought together against their common enemy.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,320,"Despite their differences, despite their suspicions."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,321,Together.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,322,We need to do the same if we're going to survive.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,323,Because the enemy is real.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,324,It's always been real.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,325,And you say you can't defeat them
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,326,without my armies and my dragons?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,327,"No, I don't think I can."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,328,I will fight for you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,329,I will fight for the North.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,330,When you bend the knee.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,331,My people...
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,332,won't accept a southern ruler.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,333,Not after everything they've suffered.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,334,They will if their king does.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,335,They chose you to lead them.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,336,They chose you to protect them.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,337,Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,338,What is it?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,339,We took Casterly Rock.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,340,That's very good to hear.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,341,Isn't it?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,342,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,343,- Perhaps-- - You will stay.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,344,All my allies are gone.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,345,They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,346,- You still have the largest armies. - Who won't be able to eat
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,347,because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,348,Tyrion: Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,349,We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,350,Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,351,- We have a plan. It's still the right plan. - The right plan!
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,352,"Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,353,- If I have underestimated our enemies-- - Our enemies?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,354,"Your family, you mean."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,355,Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,356,( dragons screeching )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,357,Enough with the clever plans.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,358,I have three large dragons.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,359,I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,360,We've discussed this.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,361,My enemies are in the Red Keep.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,362,What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,363,A smart one.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,364,What do you think I should do?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,365,- I would never presume to-- - I'm at war.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,366,I'm losing.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,367,What do you think I should do?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,368,Jon: I never thought that dragons would exist again.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,369,No one did.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,370,The people who follow you
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,371,know that you made something impossible happen.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,372,Maybe that helps them believe
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,373,that you can make other impossible things happen.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,374,Build a world that's different
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,375,from the shit one they've always known.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,376,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,377,you're not different.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,378,You're just more of the same.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,379,( dragons screeching )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,380,( both grunting )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,381,- ( huffs ) - Don't lunge.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,382,( grunting )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,383,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,384,Brienne: Up.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,385,- And don't-- - Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,386,Nice sword.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,387,Very nice dagger.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,388,"If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,389,then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,390,We can't...
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,391,It's been a while since I trained.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,392,"I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,393,He didn't beat the Hound.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,394,You did.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,395,I want to train with you.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,396,"You swore to serve both my mother's daughters,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,397,didn't you?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,398,"Brienne: Move aside, Podrick."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,399,"You can't use that, my lady. It's too small."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,400,I won't cut you. Don't worry.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,401,I'll try not to.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,402,( grunting )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,403,"( grunts, shouts )"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,404,- ( shouting ) - ( grunts )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,405,( grunts )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,406,( exhales )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,407,Who taught you how to do that?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,408,No one.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,409,( waves crashing )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,410,( seagulls screeching )
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,411,- Davos: What do you think of her? - Who?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,412,( sighs ) I believe you know of whom I speak.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,413,I think she has a good heart.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,414,A good heart?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,415,I've noticed you staring at her good heart.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,416,There's no time for that.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,417,"I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,418,How many men do we have in the North to fight him?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,419,"10,000? Less?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,420,- Fewer. - What?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,421,Speaking of good hearts-- Missandei of Naath.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,422,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,423,"King Snow, isn't it?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,424,"No, that doesn't sound right."
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,425,- King Jon? - It doesn't matter.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,426,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,427,Of course.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,428,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,429,I'm a bastard.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,430,My mother and father weren't married.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,431,Is the custom different in Naath?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,432,"We don't have marriage in Naath,"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,433,so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,434,That sounds... liberating.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,435,Why did you leave your homeland?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,436,I was stolen away by slavers.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,437,I'm sorry.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,438,"If I may, how did a slave girl"
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,439,come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,440,She bought me from my master and set me free.
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,441,Davos: That was good of her.

S07E04,The Spoils Of War,445,And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?
S07E04,The Spoils Of War,446,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

S07E05,Eastwatch,168,I shouldn't have listened to you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,169,She should have died screaming.
S07E05,Eastwatch,170,"She's dead, like her son,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,171,"her grandchildren, her whole house."
S07E05,Eastwatch,172,"And if we don't find a way out of this war, we'll follow them."
S07E05,Eastwatch,173,So we fight and die or we submit and die.
S07E05,Eastwatch,174,I know my choice.
S07E05,Eastwatch,175,A soldier should know his.
S07E05,Eastwatch,176,( Drogon screeching )
S07E05,Eastwatch,177,( roaring )
S07E05,Eastwatch,178,( snarling )
S07E05,Eastwatch,179,( snarling stops )
S07E05,Eastwatch,180,( exhales )
S07E05,Eastwatch,181,( screeching )
S07E05,Eastwatch,182,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,183,"It wasn't the word I was thinking of, but..."
S07E05,Eastwatch,184,"but, yes, they are."
S07E05,Eastwatch,185,Gorgeous beasts.
S07E05,Eastwatch,186,They're not beasts to me.
S07E05,Eastwatch,187,No matter how big they get
S07E05,Eastwatch,188,"or how terrifying to everyone else,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,189,they're my children.
S07E05,Eastwatch,190,You weren't gone long.
S07E05,Eastwatch,191,No.
S07E05,Eastwatch,192,And?
S07E05,Eastwatch,193,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
S07E05,Eastwatch,194,You're not sure how you feel about that.
S07E05,Eastwatch,195,"No, I'm not."
S07E05,Eastwatch,196,How many men did your army kill
S07E05,Eastwatch,197,taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
S07E05,Eastwatch,198,Thousands.
S07E05,Eastwatch,199,We both want to help people.
S07E05,Eastwatch,200,We can only help them from a position of strength.
S07E05,Eastwatch,201,Sometimes strength is terrible.
S07E05,Eastwatch,202,"When you first came here,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,203,Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
S07E05,Eastwatch,204,Ser Davos gets carried away.
S07E05,Eastwatch,205,"So, it was a figure of speech?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,206,( footsteps approaching )
S07E05,Eastwatch,207,( speaking Dothraki )
S07E05,Eastwatch,208,Your Grace.
S07E05,Eastwatch,209,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,210,an old friend.
S07E05,Eastwatch,211,I served with your father.
S07E05,Eastwatch,212,He was a great man.
S07E05,Eastwatch,213,You look strong.
S07E05,Eastwatch,214,You found a cure?
S07E05,Eastwatch,215,I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
S07E05,Eastwatch,216,"I return to your service, my queen,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,217,if you'll have me.
S07E05,Eastwatch,218,It would be my honor.
S07E05,Eastwatch,219,( ravens cawing )
S07E05,Eastwatch,220,( ravens cawing )
S07E05,Eastwatch,221,( panting )
S07E05,Eastwatch,222,Ravens.
S07E05,Eastwatch,223,We need to send ravens.
S07E05,Eastwatch,224,I put very little stock in it myself.
S07E05,Eastwatch,225,"Prophecies of doom are never in short supply,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,226,especially when winter comes.
S07E05,Eastwatch,227,I remember Wolkan.
S07E05,Eastwatch,228,"A little timid, but a sharp mind."
S07E05,Eastwatch,229,"Sandhu: Eh, the North has dulled many good maesters' wits."
S07E05,Eastwatch,230,"Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,231,- or the company. - ( all chuckling )
S07E05,Eastwatch,232,Sandhu: A crippled boy claims to have seen
S07E05,Eastwatch,233,"dead men on the march beyond the Wall,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,234,thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?
S07E05,Eastwatch,235,"Ebrose: Yes, it is a bit much."
S07E05,Eastwatch,236,"- Still, we ought to write back-- - Sam: Brandon Stark."
S07E05,Eastwatch,237,- The crippled boy. - Do you know him?
S07E05,Eastwatch,238,I led him through the Wall years ago.
S07E05,Eastwatch,239,I saw him go beyond the Wall.
S07E05,Eastwatch,240,And?
S07E05,Eastwatch,241,"Somehow, a crippled boy"
S07E05,Eastwatch,242,survived for years beyond the Wall when no one else could.
S07E05,Eastwatch,243,"Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one."
S07E05,Eastwatch,244,Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.
S07E05,Eastwatch,245,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
S07E05,Eastwatch,246,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?
S07E05,Eastwatch,247,( clears throat )
S07E05,Eastwatch,248,Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,249,"If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it."
S07E05,Eastwatch,250,If you advise all the lords to send their men north
S07E05,Eastwatch,251,"to hold the Wall, they'll do it."
S07E05,Eastwatch,252,And if you tell every maester in the Citadel
S07E05,Eastwatch,253,to search every word of every faded scroll
S07E05,Eastwatch,254,"about the Long Night,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,255,they may find something that lets us defeat
S07E05,Eastwatch,256,the Army of the Dead for good.
S07E05,Eastwatch,257,It could be done.
S07E05,Eastwatch,258,And this news could be authentic.
S07E05,Eastwatch,259,It's possible.
S07E05,Eastwatch,260,It's also possible that this message
S07E05,Eastwatch,261,is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen
S07E05,Eastwatch,262,to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending
S07E05,Eastwatch,263,to open those lands to easy conquest.
S07E05,Eastwatch,264,Sandhu: That does seem far more likely
S07E05,Eastwatch,265,than magic birds talking to cripples.
S07E05,Eastwatch,266,"Archmaester, please."
S07E05,Eastwatch,267,It's real.
S07E05,Eastwatch,268,I've seen it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,269,We will write to Maester Wolkan
S07E05,Eastwatch,270,at Winterfell for clarification.
S07E05,Eastwatch,271,I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
S07E05,Eastwatch,272,"- Archmaester, please-- - That will be all, Tarly."
S07E05,Eastwatch,273,"Maester: It brings to mind the work of Jenny of Oldstones,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,274,the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest.
S07E05,Eastwatch,275,"- ( all chuckling ) - Sandhu: Don't forget the prophet Lodos,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,276,who promised that the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.
S07E05,Eastwatch,277,"- ( all laugh ) - Ah, Lodos."
S07E05,Eastwatch,278,Is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive?
S07E05,Eastwatch,279,I'm afraid so.
S07E05,Eastwatch,280,Horrible business.
S07E05,Eastwatch,281,I haven't had the heart to tell him yet.
S07E05,Eastwatch,282,He's a good lad.
S07E05,Eastwatch,283,Right.
S07E05,Eastwatch,284,The ravenry was falling apart the last time I checked.
S07E05,Eastwatch,285,( slurping )
S07E05,Eastwatch,286,All rulers demand that people bend the knee.
S07E05,Eastwatch,287,That's why they're rulers.
S07E05,Eastwatch,288,"She gave Tarly a choice,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,289,a man who had taken up arms against her.
S07E05,Eastwatch,290,What else could she do?
S07E05,Eastwatch,291,Not burn him alive alongside his son?
S07E05,Eastwatch,292,"I am her Hand, not her head."
S07E05,Eastwatch,293,I can't make her decisions for her.
S07E05,Eastwatch,294,That's what I used to tell myself about her father.
S07E05,Eastwatch,295,"I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive."
S07E05,Eastwatch,296,I was only a purveyor of information.
S07E05,Eastwatch,297,It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy--
S07E05,Eastwatch,298,I'm not the one doing it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,299,When the pitch of their screams rose higher--
S07E05,Eastwatch,300,I'm not the one doing it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,301,When their hair caught fire
S07E05,Eastwatch,302,and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room--
S07E05,Eastwatch,303,I'm not the one doing it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,304,( sighs )
S07E05,Eastwatch,305,Daenerys is not her father.
S07E05,Eastwatch,306,And she never will be
S07E05,Eastwatch,307,with the right counsel.
S07E05,Eastwatch,308,You need to find a way to make her listen.
S07E05,Eastwatch,309,- Who's that for? - Jon Snow.
S07E05,Eastwatch,310,Did you read it?
S07E05,Eastwatch,311,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
S07E05,Eastwatch,312,What's it say?
S07E05,Eastwatch,313,Nothing good.
S07E05,Eastwatch,314,I thought Arya was dead.
S07E05,Eastwatch,315,I thought Bran was dead.
S07E05,Eastwatch,316,I'm happy for you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,317,You don't look happy.
S07E05,Eastwatch,318,Bran saw the Night King and his army
S07E05,Eastwatch,319,marching towards Eastwatch.
S07E05,Eastwatch,320,If they make it past the Wall...
S07E05,Eastwatch,321,"The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years, presumably."
S07E05,Eastwatch,322,I need to go home.
S07E05,Eastwatch,323,You said you don't have enough men.
S07E05,Eastwatch,324,We'll fight with the men we have.
S07E05,Eastwatch,325,Unless you'll join us.
S07E05,Eastwatch,326,And give the country to Cersei?
S07E05,Eastwatch,327,"As soon as I march away, she marches in."
S07E05,Eastwatch,328,Perhaps not.
S07E05,Eastwatch,329,Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story
S07E05,Eastwatch,330,made up by wet nurses to frighten children.
S07E05,Eastwatch,331,What if we prove her wrong?
S07E05,Eastwatch,332,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
S07E05,Eastwatch,333,So bring the dead to her.
S07E05,Eastwatch,334,I thought that was what we were trying to avoid.
S07E05,Eastwatch,335,We don't have to bring the whole army.
S07E05,Eastwatch,336,Only one soldier.
S07E05,Eastwatch,337,Is that possible?
S07E05,Eastwatch,338,The first wight I ever saw
S07E05,Eastwatch,339,was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
S07E05,Eastwatch,340,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing
S07E05,Eastwatch,341,and show her the truth.
S07E05,Eastwatch,342,Anything you bring back will be useless
S07E05,Eastwatch,343,unless Cersei grants us an audience
S07E05,Eastwatch,344,and is somehow convinced not to murder us
S07E05,Eastwatch,345,the moment we set foot in the capital.
S07E05,Eastwatch,346,The only person she listens to is Jaime.
S07E05,Eastwatch,347,He might listen to me.
S07E05,Eastwatch,348,And how would you get into King's Landing?
S07E05,Eastwatch,349,"I can smuggle you in,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,350,"but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,351,"I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
S07E05,Eastwatch,352,"Well, it will all be for nothing"
S07E05,Eastwatch,353,if we don't have one of these dead men.
S07E05,Eastwatch,354,Fair point.
S07E05,Eastwatch,355,How do you propose to find one?
S07E05,Eastwatch,356,"With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one."
S07E05,Eastwatch,357,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,358,Allow me to serve you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,359,The Free Folk will help us.
S07E05,Eastwatch,360,They know the real north better than anyone.
S07E05,Eastwatch,361,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
S07E05,Eastwatch,362,They won't have to.
S07E05,Eastwatch,363,You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.
S07E05,Eastwatch,364,"You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North."
S07E05,Eastwatch,365,I'm the only one here who's fought them.
S07E05,Eastwatch,366,I'm the only one here who knows them.
S07E05,Eastwatch,367,I haven't given you permission to leave.
S07E05,Eastwatch,368,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission."
S07E05,Eastwatch,369,I am a king.
S07E05,Eastwatch,370,And I came here
S07E05,Eastwatch,371,knowing that you could have your men behead me
S07E05,Eastwatch,372,or your dragons burn me alive.
S07E05,Eastwatch,373,"I put my trust in you, a stranger,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,374,"because I knew it was the best chance for my people,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,375,for all our people.
S07E05,Eastwatch,376,Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger...
S07E05,Eastwatch,377,because it's our best chance.
S07E05,Eastwatch,378,( all chattering )
S07E05,Eastwatch,379,Glover: The King in the North should stay in the North.
S07E05,Eastwatch,380,"We did not choose you to rule us, my lady."
S07E05,Eastwatch,381,- But perhaps we should have. - ( all murmuring )
S07E05,Eastwatch,382,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
S07E05,Eastwatch,383,Men: Aye.
S07E05,Eastwatch,384,"You are very kind, my lords."
S07E05,Eastwatch,385,But Jon is our king.
S07E05,Eastwatch,386,He is doing what he thinks is best.
S07E05,Eastwatch,387,( chatter )
S07E05,Eastwatch,388,Sansa: I warned Jon this would happen.
S07E05,Eastwatch,389,That he couldn't leave the North
S07E05,Eastwatch,390,and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
S07E05,Eastwatch,391,He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
S07E05,Eastwatch,392,"Well, he's not making it easy. The Northern lords are proud."
S07E05,Eastwatch,393,These are Mother and Father's chambers.
S07E05,Eastwatch,394,And?
S07E05,Eastwatch,395,Nothing.
S07E05,Eastwatch,396,Don't do that.
S07E05,Eastwatch,397,- What? - Say what you mean.
S07E05,Eastwatch,398,You always liked nice things.
S07E05,Eastwatch,399,They made you feel better than everyone.
S07E05,Eastwatch,400,Are you angry with me?
S07E05,Eastwatch,401,"They were insulting Jon,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,402,and you sat there and listened.
S07E05,Eastwatch,403,"I listened to their complaints,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,404,which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.
S07E05,Eastwatch,405,Their opinions are important to you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,406,"Glover has 500 men, Royce has 2,000."
S07E05,Eastwatch,407,Offend them and Jon loses his army.
S07E05,Eastwatch,408,Not if they lose their heads first.
S07E05,Eastwatch,409,Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.
S07E05,Eastwatch,410,"We took it back,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,411,and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods
S07E05,Eastwatch,412,and the wildlings and the Vale.
S07E05,Eastwatch,413,"All of us, working together."
S07E05,Eastwatch,414,"Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,415,but that's not the way you get people to work together.
S07E05,Eastwatch,416,"And if Jon doesn't come back,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,417,you'll need their support...
S07E05,Eastwatch,418,so you can work together
S07E05,Eastwatch,419,to give you what you really want.
S07E05,Eastwatch,420,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
S07E05,Eastwatch,421,You're thinking it right now.
S07E05,Eastwatch,422,"You don't want to be,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,423,but the thought just won't go away.
S07E05,Eastwatch,424,I have work to do.
S07E05,Eastwatch,425,My lady.
S07E05,Eastwatch,426,"( door opens, closes )"
S07E05,Eastwatch,427,"Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow."
S07E05,Eastwatch,428,"Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire."
S07E05,Eastwatch,429,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.
S07E05,Eastwatch,430,The guards hardly ever patrol it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,431,Too many steps.
S07E05,Eastwatch,432,You're not staying here?
S07E05,Eastwatch,433,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
S07E05,Eastwatch,434,What if someone takes the boat?
S07E05,Eastwatch,435,Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
S07E05,Eastwatch,436,We don't have time for this.
S07E05,Eastwatch,437,We should be preparing the city for a siege.
S07E05,Eastwatch,438,The Dothraki are coming.
S07E05,Eastwatch,439,All the more reason for you to train.
S07E05,Eastwatch,440,Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.
S07E05,Eastwatch,441,"Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well."
S07E05,Eastwatch,442,"And here I am, ready to train."
S07E05,Eastwatch,443,Why down here?
S07E05,Eastwatch,444,I don't think you want people to see
S07E05,Eastwatch,445,how you look swinging that thing yet.
S07E05,Eastwatch,446,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
S07E05,Eastwatch,447,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
S07E05,Eastwatch,448,I'll leave you to it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,449,I needed to see you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,450,And I knew you'd never agree to meet.
S07E05,Eastwatch,451,You made me look like a complete fool.
S07E05,Eastwatch,452,"I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,453,but you were three steps ahead of me.
S07E05,Eastwatch,454,"Abandoned the family home, completely unsentimental."
S07E05,Eastwatch,455,Father would have been proud.
S07E05,Eastwatch,456,- Don't talk about Father. - Listen to me--
S07E05,Eastwatch,457,I once told Bronn
S07E05,Eastwatch,458,"that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half."
S07E05,Eastwatch,459,It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.
S07E05,Eastwatch,460,He was going to execute me.
S07E05,Eastwatch,461,He knew I was innocent.
S07E05,Eastwatch,462,"He didn't hate me because of anything I did,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,463,he hated me because of what I am.
S07E05,Eastwatch,464,A little monster sent to punish him.
S07E05,Eastwatch,465,Did he-- did he think--
S07E05,Eastwatch,466,did he think I wanted to be born this way?
S07E05,Eastwatch,467,- Did he think I chose it-- - What do you want?!
S07E05,Eastwatch,468,Daenerys will win this war.
S07E05,Eastwatch,469,You're a military man.
S07E05,Eastwatch,470,You must know there's no way around that.
S07E05,Eastwatch,471,Daenerys is not her father.
S07E05,Eastwatch,472,She's even willing to suspend the hostilities
S07E05,Eastwatch,473,if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
S07E05,Eastwatch,474,"If you want Cersei to bend the knee,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,475,you can ask her yourself.
S07E05,Eastwatch,476,I-- I don't. And Daenerys doesn't.
S07E05,Eastwatch,477,"Not right now, anyway."
S07E05,Eastwatch,478,She has a more important request.
S07E05,Eastwatch,479,( chatter )
S07E05,Eastwatch,480,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,481,Thought you might still be rowing.
S07E05,Eastwatch,482,( chuckles )
S07E05,Eastwatch,483,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels."
S07E05,Eastwatch,484,Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.
S07E05,Eastwatch,485,Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?
S07E05,Eastwatch,486,Haven't been here in years.
S07E05,Eastwatch,487,Why should they recognize me?
S07E05,Eastwatch,488,Sometimes I hardly do.
S07E05,Eastwatch,489,Nothing fucks you harder than time.
S07E05,Eastwatch,490,Anybody give you any trouble?
S07E05,Eastwatch,491,"Here I am, arming Lannisters,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,492,and I never get a second look.
S07E05,Eastwatch,493,But you were right.
S07E05,Eastwatch,494,Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
S07E05,Eastwatch,495,Don't be so sure.
S07E05,Eastwatch,496,Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.
S07E05,Eastwatch,497,Bad things are coming.
S07E05,Eastwatch,498,You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,499,"- Well, the thing you need to understand is-- - I'm ready."
S07E05,Eastwatch,500,- You-- - Let's go.
S07E05,Eastwatch,501,You should know what you're heading into.
S07E05,Eastwatch,502,What do you think I've been thinking about
S07E05,Eastwatch,503,with every swing of the hammer?
S07E05,Eastwatch,504,How happy I am making weapons
S07E05,Eastwatch,505,for the family that killed my father?
S07E05,Eastwatch,506,The family that tried to kill me?
S07E05,Eastwatch,507,( scoffs )
S07E05,Eastwatch,508,I've been getting ready.
S07E05,Eastwatch,509,"I never knew what for,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,510,but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.
S07E05,Eastwatch,511,You might want to bring one of those swords.
S07E05,Eastwatch,512,I don't know much about swinging swords.
S07E05,Eastwatch,513,But this...
S07E05,Eastwatch,514,this I know.
S07E05,Eastwatch,515,Keep your father's name to yourself.
S07E05,Eastwatch,516,Situation's complicated enough already.
S07E05,Eastwatch,517,"Well, who should I say I am?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,518,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,519,- someone's going to-- - Gold cloak: You there!
S07E05,Eastwatch,520,"No weapons, friends. I promise."
S07E05,Eastwatch,521,What can I do for you?
S07E05,Eastwatch,522,- Is that your boat? - It is.
S07E05,Eastwatch,523,- Gold cloak: The docks are that way. - Davos: That they are.
S07E05,Eastwatch,524,I try to stay away from them
S07E05,Eastwatch,525,to avoid good men such as yourselves.
S07E05,Eastwatch,526,- Still five gold dragons? - ( laughs ) Are you joking?
S07E05,Eastwatch,527,You must be even older than you look.
S07E05,Eastwatch,528,- 15. - 15?!
S07E05,Eastwatch,529,Apiece.
S07E05,Eastwatch,530,- ( sighs ) - ( coins jingling )
S07E05,Eastwatch,531,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,532,Gold cloak ♪2: What's in the boat?
S07E05,Eastwatch,533,Not more gold.
S07E05,Eastwatch,534,- Wine? - Mm.
S07E05,Eastwatch,535,- I like wine. - Or hams.
S07E05,Eastwatch,536,Come have a look.
S07E05,Eastwatch,537,- Fermented crab. - What?
S07E05,Eastwatch,538,Davos: Fermented crab.
S07E05,Eastwatch,539,One bucket of this triples a brothel's earnings for the week.
S07E05,Eastwatch,540,A man thinks he's done.
S07E05,Eastwatch,541,He's ready to go back to his loving family.
S07E05,Eastwatch,542,"But before he gets his breeches up,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,543,his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.
S07E05,Eastwatch,544,"Five minutes later, he's back in the race."
S07E05,Eastwatch,545,"Here, have a taste."
S07E05,Eastwatch,546,"I'd hurry to your favorite establishment,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,547,or you'll put a hole in that chainmail.
S07E05,Eastwatch,548,( laughing )
S07E05,Eastwatch,549,( chattering )
S07E05,Eastwatch,550,"Oi, dwarf!"
S07E05,Eastwatch,551,I really wouldn't try any more
S07E05,Eastwatch,552,until you see how the first bite hits you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,553,That dwarf...
S07E05,Eastwatch,554,Where'd you get that scar?
S07E05,Eastwatch,555,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
S07E05,Eastwatch,556,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back.
S07E05,Eastwatch,557,Davos: Perhaps there's some arrangement?
S07E05,Eastwatch,558,( coins jingle )
S07E05,Eastwatch,559,Arrangement?
S07E05,Eastwatch,560,You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei--
S07E05,Eastwatch,561,( grunting )
S07E05,Eastwatch,562,- ( sighs ) - This is Gendry.
S07E05,Eastwatch,563,He'll do.
S07E05,Eastwatch,564,"Go, go, go."
S07E05,Eastwatch,565,Qyburn: I could give you something.
S07E05,Eastwatch,566,That won't be necessary.
S07E05,Eastwatch,567,Ser Jaime.
S07E05,Eastwatch,568,- ( door closes ) - Why was Qyburn here?
S07E05,Eastwatch,569,He's the Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
S07E05,Eastwatch,570,I met with Tyrion.
S07E05,Eastwatch,571,What did our brother have to say?
S07E05,Eastwatch,572,Daenerys wants to meet.
S07E05,Eastwatch,573,To discuss her surrender?
S07E05,Eastwatch,574,To discuss an armistice.
S07E05,Eastwatch,575,She's just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
S07E05,Eastwatch,576,Because an army of dead men
S07E05,Eastwatch,577,is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.
S07E05,Eastwatch,578,Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
S07E05,Eastwatch,579,( chuckles )
S07E05,Eastwatch,580,- Are you going to punish him? - Tyrion?
S07E05,Eastwatch,581,Bronn.
S07E05,Eastwatch,582,He betrayed you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,583,He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.
S07E05,Eastwatch,584,Do you think anything of importance
S07E05,Eastwatch,585,happens in this city without me knowing?
S07E05,Eastwatch,586,You let it happen. Why?
S07E05,Eastwatch,587,I've come to believe that
S07E05,Eastwatch,588,an accommodation with the Dragon Queen
S07E05,Eastwatch,589,could be in our immediate interest.
S07E05,Eastwatch,590,"She has the numbers. If we want to beat her, we have to be clever."
S07E05,Eastwatch,591,We have to fight her like Father would have.
S07E05,Eastwatch,592,"Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens..."
S07E05,Eastwatch,593,"Whatever stands in our way,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,594,we will defeat it.
S07E05,Eastwatch,595,"For ourselves, for our house,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,596,for this.
S07E05,Eastwatch,597,Who will you say is the father?
S07E05,Eastwatch,598,You.
S07E05,Eastwatch,599,People won't like that.
S07E05,Eastwatch,600,Do you remember what Father used to say about people?
S07E05,Eastwatch,601,The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
S07E05,Eastwatch,602,Never betray me again.
S07E05,Eastwatch,603,Davos: We're leaving today.
S07E05,Eastwatch,604,- The king's got a lot on his mind. - I understand.
S07E05,Eastwatch,605,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
S07E05,Eastwatch,606,"- You don't have to worry. - You're just Clovis,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,607,a smith who's come to pay his respects
S07E05,Eastwatch,608,before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.
S07E05,Eastwatch,609,Understood.
S07E05,Eastwatch,610,- ( hammering ) - ( chatter )
S07E05,Eastwatch,611,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
S07E05,Eastwatch,612,You survived King's Landing.
S07E05,Eastwatch,613,"Yet again. Your Grace, this is Clo--"
S07E05,Eastwatch,614,"Name's Gendry, Your Grace."
S07E05,Eastwatch,615,I'm Robert Baratheon's son.
S07E05,Eastwatch,616,Bastard son.
S07E05,Eastwatch,617,He was meant to keep that to himself.
S07E05,Eastwatch,618,Our fathers trusted each other.
S07E05,Eastwatch,619,Why shouldn't we?
S07E05,Eastwatch,620,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
S07E05,Eastwatch,621,I met yours in my shop.
S07E05,Eastwatch,622,- You're a lot leaner. - And you're a lot shorter.
S07E05,Eastwatch,623,I grew up on stories about them.
S07E05,Eastwatch,624,All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.
S07E05,Eastwatch,625,"Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why."
S07E05,Eastwatch,626,Let me come with you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,627,Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
S07E05,Eastwatch,628,"No, but I'm a fighter."
S07E05,Eastwatch,629,And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.
S07E05,Eastwatch,630,You know how to use one?
S07E05,Eastwatch,631,"Well, that's a problem."
S07E05,Eastwatch,632,I prefer a hammer.
S07E05,Eastwatch,633,He can handle himself.
S07E05,Eastwatch,634,We could use the help.
S07E05,Eastwatch,635,"As my father used to say,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,636,"""It's better to be a coward for a minute,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,637,"than dead for the rest of your life."""
S07E05,Eastwatch,638,I owe you my life.
S07E05,Eastwatch,639,Twice over.
S07E05,Eastwatch,640,"But if what you said is true about what's up there,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,641,I can't wait out this war.
S07E05,Eastwatch,642,"Yeah, nobody mind me."
S07E05,Eastwatch,643,All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
S07E05,Eastwatch,644,"Man: All right, come on."
S07E05,Eastwatch,645,( grunts )
S07E05,Eastwatch,646,"Tyrion: You may not believe it,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,647,"but I've missed you, Mormont."
S07E05,Eastwatch,648,Nobody glowers quite like you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,649,Not even Grey Worm.
S07E05,Eastwatch,650,This is the coin the slaver gave me
S07E05,Eastwatch,651,"when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,652,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
S07E05,Eastwatch,653,Take it with you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,654,But bring it back.
S07E05,Eastwatch,655,Our queen needs you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,656,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
S07E05,Eastwatch,657,"Your Grace, I..."
S07E05,Eastwatch,658,"If I don't return, at least you won't have to deal"
S07E05,Eastwatch,659,with the King in the North anymore.
S07E05,Eastwatch,660,I've grown used to him.
S07E05,Eastwatch,661,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
S07E05,Eastwatch,662,Heave!
S07E05,Eastwatch,663,( fire crackling )
S07E05,Eastwatch,664,Gilly: Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
S07E05,Eastwatch,665,No.
S07E05,Eastwatch,666,"15,782."
S07E05,Eastwatch,667,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
S07E05,Eastwatch,668,None anymore.
S07E05,Eastwatch,669,That's true.
S07E05,Eastwatch,670,"This High Septon Maynard, he recorded everything."
S07E05,Eastwatch,671,He even recorded his own bowel movements.
S07E05,Eastwatch,672,"What does ""annulment"" mean?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,673,It's when a man sets aside his lawful wife.
S07E05,Eastwatch,674,"Maynard says here that he issued an annulment for a Prince ""Ragger"""
S07E05,Eastwatch,675,and remarried him to someone else at the same time
S07E05,Eastwatch,676,in a secret ceremony in Dorne.
S07E05,Eastwatch,677,Is that a common thing in the south or--?
S07E05,Eastwatch,678,These maesters...
S07E05,Eastwatch,679,they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting
S07E05,Eastwatch,680,"and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,681,while the secret to defeating the Night King's
S07E05,Eastwatch,682,"probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere, completely ignored."
S07E05,Eastwatch,683,"But that's all right, isn't it?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,684,"We can all become slavering, murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate"
S07E05,Eastwatch,685,as long as we can have access to the full records
S07E05,Eastwatch,686,"of High Septon Maynard's 15,782 shits!"
S07E05,Eastwatch,687,Steps.
S07E05,Eastwatch,688,That number was the steps.
S07E05,Eastwatch,689,( giggles )
S07E05,Eastwatch,690,Are you sure you want to do this?
S07E05,Eastwatch,691,You always wanted to be a maester.
S07E05,Eastwatch,692,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
S07E05,Eastwatch,693,- ( whispering ) - ( horse whinnies )
S07E05,Eastwatch,694,( dog barking )
S07E05,Eastwatch,695,( quiet chatter )
S07E05,Eastwatch,696,"Wolkan: I found it, my lord."
S07E05,Eastwatch,697,"It, uh, took some searching."
S07E05,Eastwatch,698,Maester Luwin's archives are very thorough.
S07E05,Eastwatch,699,You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?
S07E05,Eastwatch,700,"Uh, yes, my lord."
S07E05,Eastwatch,701,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
S07E05,Eastwatch,702,"( door closes, lock clicks )"
S07E05,Eastwatch,703,Tormund: Isn't it your job to talk him out
S07E05,Eastwatch,704,of stupid fucking ideas like this?
S07E05,Eastwatch,705,I've been failing at that job of late.
S07E05,Eastwatch,706,How many queens are there now?
S07E05,Eastwatch,707,Two.
S07E05,Eastwatch,708,And you need to convince the one with the dragons
S07E05,Eastwatch,709,or the one who fucks her brother?
S07E05,Eastwatch,710,( chuckles )
S07E05,Eastwatch,711,Both.
S07E05,Eastwatch,712,How many men did you bring?
S07E05,Eastwatch,713,Jon: Not enough.
S07E05,Eastwatch,714,The big woman?
S07E05,Eastwatch,715,We were hoping some of your men could help.
S07E05,Eastwatch,716,- Hmm. - I'll be staying behind.
S07E05,Eastwatch,717,"I'm a liability out there, as you well know."
S07E05,Eastwatch,718,You are.
S07E05,Eastwatch,719,You really want to go out there? Again?
S07E05,Eastwatch,720,You're not the only ones.
S07E05,Eastwatch,721,My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.
S07E05,Eastwatch,722,Said they were on their way here.
S07E05,Eastwatch,723,You're the Hound.
S07E05,Eastwatch,724,I saw you once at Winterfell.
S07E05,Eastwatch,725,"They want to go beyond the Wall, too."
S07E05,Eastwatch,726,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to."
S07E05,Eastwatch,727,Our Lord told us that the Great War is coming--
S07E05,Eastwatch,728,Gendry: Don't trust him.
S07E05,Eastwatch,729,Don't trust any of them.
S07E05,Eastwatch,730,They're the Brotherhood.
S07E05,Eastwatch,731,And the last thing their lord told them to do
S07E05,Eastwatch,732,was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.
S07E05,Eastwatch,733,Jorah: Thoros?
S07E05,Eastwatch,734,I hardly recognized you.
S07E05,Eastwatch,735,Ser Jorah Mormont.
S07E05,Eastwatch,736,They won't give me anything to drink down here.
S07E05,Eastwatch,737,I haven't been feeling like myself.
S07E05,Eastwatch,738,Tormund: You're a fucking Mormont?
S07E05,Eastwatch,739,Like the last Lord Commander?
S07E05,Eastwatch,740,He was my father.
S07E05,Eastwatch,741,He hunted us like animals.
S07E05,Eastwatch,742,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
S07E05,Eastwatch,743,( growls )
S07E05,Eastwatch,744,Here we all are
S07E05,Eastwatch,745,at the edge of the world
S07E05,Eastwatch,746,"at the same moment,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,747,heading in the same direction for the same reason.
S07E05,Eastwatch,748,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
S07E05,Eastwatch,749,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
S07E05,Eastwatch,750,There's a greater purpose at work.
S07E05,Eastwatch,751,"And we serve it together,"
S07E05,Eastwatch,752,whether we know it or not.
S07E05,Eastwatch,753,"We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light--"
S07E05,Eastwatch,754,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,755,Are we coming with you or not?
S07E05,Eastwatch,756,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
S07E05,Eastwatch,757,"Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell, waiting to die?"
S07E05,Eastwatch,758,He's right.
S07E05,Eastwatch,759,We're all on the same side.
S07E05,Eastwatch,760,How can we be?
S07E05,Eastwatch,761,We're all breathing.
S07E05,Eastwatch,762,( gate rumbling )
S07E05,Eastwatch,763,( wind howling )
S07E05,Eastwatch,764,( music playing )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,1,LORD VARYS: Your father has proved to be an awful traitor.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,2,The girl is innocent. She should be given a chance
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,3,to prove her loyalty.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,4,CERSEI LANNISTER: You must write to Lady Catelyn.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,5,"If you would help your father, urge your brother"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,6,to keep the king's peace.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,7,"Tell him to come to King's Landing,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,8,and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,9,You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,10,(DRAGON GROWLING)
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,11,TYRION LANNISTER: Daenerys is not her father.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,12,VARYS: And she never will be. With the right counsel.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,13,"I am her hand, not her head."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,14,I can't make her decisions for her.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,15,You need to find a way to make her listen.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,16,JEOR MORMONT: It's called Longclaw. It was my father's sword.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,17,"It was meant for my son, Jorah."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,18,"He brought dishonor to our house,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,19,but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,20,from Westeros.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,21,"Clegane, look into the flames. What do you see?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,22,(FIRE CRACKLING)
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,23,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,24,The dead are marching past. Thousands of 'em.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,25,TYRION: Cersei thinks the army of the dead
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,26,is nothing but a story.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,27,"What if we prove her wrong, bring one of these things"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,28,down to King's Landing and show her the truth?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,29,JON SNOW: We're all on the same side.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,30,We're all breathin'.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,31,( theme music playing )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,32,( wind howling )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,33,- You all right? - Mm.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,34,Ever been north before?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,35,Never seen snow before.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,36,"Beautiful, eh?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,37,I can breathe again.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,38,"Down south, the air smells like pig shit."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,39,You've never been down south.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,40,- I've been to Winterfell. - That's the North.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,41,( blows raspberry )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,42,Gendry: How do you live up here?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,43,How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,44,Tormund: You got to keep moving. That's the secret.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,45,"Walking's good, fighting's better, fucking's best."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,46,There's not a living woman within a hundred miles of here.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,47,We have to make do with what we've got.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,48,This one is maybe not so smart.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,49,Davos says he's a strong fighter.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,50,Good. That's more important than being smart.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,51,Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,52,"Tormund: So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,53,And?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,54,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,55,You spent too much time with the Free Folk.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,56,Now you don't like kneeling.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,57,Mance Rayder was a brave man.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,58,A proud man.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,59,The King-beyond-the-Wall never bent the knee.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,60,How many of his people died for his pride?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,61,"You still mad at us, boy?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,62,You sold me to a witch.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,63,A priestess.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,64,"I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,65,We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,66,I wanted to be one of you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,67,"I wanted to join the Brotherhood, but you sold me off"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,68,like a slave.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,69,Do you know what she did to me?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,70,"She strapped me down on a bed,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,71,- she stripped me naked... - Sounds all right so far.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,72,"- ...and put leeches on me. - Was she naked, too?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,73,She needed your blood.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,74,"Yes, thank you. I know that."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,75,- Could have been worse. - She wanted to kill me!
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,76,"- They would have killed me if wasn't for Davos. - But they didn't, did they?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,77,"So, what you whinging about?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,78,I'm not whinging.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,79,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,80,That's whinging.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,81,This one's been killed six times.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,82,You don't hear him bitching about it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,83,Good lad.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,84,Jon: The first time I went north of the Wall was with your father.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,85,He was a good man.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,86,He deserved a better son.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,87,Were you with him at the end?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,88,I was a prisoner of the wildlings.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,89,But we avenged him.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,90,I want you to know that.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,91,Every mutineer found justice.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,92,Can't think of a worse way for him to go.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,93,The Night's Watch was his life.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,94,He would have died to protect every one of those men.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,95,And they butchered him.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,96,I hate that he died that way.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,97,My father was the most honorable man I ever met.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,98,He was good all the way through.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,99,And he died on the executioner's block.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,100,"Your father wanted to execute me, you know?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,101,I heard.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,102,"He was in the right, of course."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,103,Didn't make me hate him any less.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,104,"- I'm glad he didn't catch you. - Me, too."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,105,Your father gave me this sword.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,106,Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf...
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,107,but it's still Longclaw.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,108,Lord Commander Mormont
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,109,thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,110,"But you are back,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,111,and it's been in your family for centuries.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,112,It's not right for me to have it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,113,He gave it to you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,114,I'm not his son.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,115,I brought shame onto my house.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,116,I broke my father's heart.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,117,I forfeited the right to claim this sword.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,118,It's yours.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,119,May it serve you well...
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,120,and your children after you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,121,( sighs )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,122,( chatter )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,123,Father used to watch us from up here.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,124,He wouldn't say much.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,125,You probably don't remember.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,126,You were inside knitting all the time.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,127,I remember.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,128,"One time, the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrik."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,129,"I came out here after,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,130,"and Bran had left his bow behind,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,131,just lying on the ground.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,132,Ser Rodrik would have cuffed him if he saw.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,133,There was one arrow in the target.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,134,"There was no one around, just like now."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,135,No one to stop me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,136,So I started shooting.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,137,"And every shot, I had to go up there"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,138,and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,139,I wasn't very good.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,140,"Finally, I hit the bull's-eye."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,141,Could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,142,I don't remember.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,143,"But I hit the bull's-eye, and I heard this."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,144,"I looked up,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,145,"and he's standing right here,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,146,smiling down at me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,147,I knew what I was doing was against the rules.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,148,"But he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,149,The rules were wrong.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,150,"I was doing what I was meant to be doing, and he knew it."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,151,Now he's dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,152,Killed by the Lannisters
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,153,with your help.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,154,What?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,155,That's your pretty handwriting.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,156,Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,157,'cause I couldn't write as well as you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,158,"""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,159,"Our good King Robert is dead,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,160,"killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt."""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,161,You don't have to read it. I remember.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,162,"""Father has been charged with treason."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,163,He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,164,and tried to steal his throne.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,165,The Lannisters are treating me well
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,166,and providing me with every comfort.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,167,"I beg you, come to King's Landing,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,168,"swear fealty to King Joffrey,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,169,and prevent any strife between the great houses
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,170,of Lannister and Stark.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,171,"Your faithful sister, Sansa."""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,172,They forced me to do it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,173,Did they?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,174,With a knife at your throat?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,175,Did they put you on a rack and stretch you
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,176,until your bones started to pop?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,177,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,178,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,179,They told me it was the only way to save Father.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,180,And you were stupid enough to believe them.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,181,I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,182,when they dragged Father to the block.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,183,I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,184,I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,185,You were there?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,186,I was there.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,187,Standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,188,And what did you do?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,189,Did you come running to the rescue?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,190,Did you fight off the Lannisters and save Father?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,191,"- I wanted to. - But you didn't, just like me."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,192,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,193,I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,194,"You should be on your knees, thanking me."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,195,We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,196,"You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,197,He lost the Battle of the Bastards.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,198,"The Knights of the Vale won the battle,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,199,and they rode north for me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,200,"While you were off, where? Traveling the world?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,201,- I was training. - Training.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,202,"Well, while you were training,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,203,I suffered things you could never imagine.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,204,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,205,You never would have survived what I survived.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,206,I guess we'll never know.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,207,What are you going to do with that letter?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,208,I don't know yet.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,209,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,210,"You're scared, aren't you?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,211,What are you scared of?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,212,You didn't commit any crimes.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,213,"- No one's going to hang you. - Well, Arya--"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,214,You're scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,215,"No, that's not Jon. He'll understand."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,216,"You were just a scared little girl,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,217,all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,218,Do you know how happy Cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,219,This is exactly what she wants.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,220,This is what she's always wanted-- to tear us apart.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,221,You're scared the Northern lords will read it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,222,They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,223,if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,224,What would little Lyanna Mormont say?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,225,She's younger than you were when you wrote this.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,226,"Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child?"""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,227,You're angry.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,228,Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,229,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,230,I'll go with anger.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,231,"You're the one they call ""the Dog."""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,232,- Fuck off. - ( chuckles )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,233,They told me you were mean.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,234,Were you born mean or you just hate wildings?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,235,I don't give two shits about wildings.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,236,It's gingers I hate.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,237,Gingers are beautiful.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,238,"We are kissed by fire, just like you."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,239,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,240,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,241,"I didn't trip, I was pushed."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,242,"And ever since, you've been mean."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,243,Will you fuck off?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,244,I don't think you're truly mean.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,245,You have sad eyes.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,246,"You want to suck my dick, is that it?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,247,- Dick? - Cock.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,248,"Ah, dick."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,249,I like it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,250,I bet you do.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,251,"Nope, it's pussy for me."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,252,I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,253,If I ever get back there.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,254,"Yellow hair, blue eyes,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,255,the tallest woman you've ever seen.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,256,Almost as tall as you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,257,- Brienne of Tarth. - You know her?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,258,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,259,"Well, not with her yet."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,260,- But I see the way she looks at me. - How does she look at you?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,261,Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,262,You do know her.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,263,We've met.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,264,I want to make babies with her.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,265,Think of them-- great big monsters.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,266,They'd conquer the world.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,267,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,268,I'm good at killing people.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,269,You don't look much like him.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,270,Who's that?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,271,Your father.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,272,I suppose you favor your mother.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,273,You knew him?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,274,'Course I did.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,275,"When he was Hand,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,276,he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,277,Your wildling friend told me
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,278,the red woman brought you back.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,279,Thoros has brought me back six times.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,280,We both serve the same lord.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,281,I serve the North.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,282,The North didn't raise you from the dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,283,The Lord of Light never spoke to me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,284,I don't know anything about him.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,285,I don't know what he wants from me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,286,- He wants you alive. - Why?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,287,I don't know.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,288,"That's all anyone can tell me-- ""I don't know."""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,289,"So, what's the point in serving a god"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,290,if none of us knows what he wants?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,291,I think about that all the time.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,292,I don't think it's our purpose to understand.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,293,Except one thing-- we're soldiers.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,294,We have to know what we're fighting for.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,295,I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,296,can sit on a throne made of swords.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,297,"So, what are you fighting for?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,298,Life.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,299,Death is the enemy.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,300,The first enemy and the last.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,301,But we all die.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,302,The enemy always wins.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,303,And we still need to fight him.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,304,That's all I know.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,305,"You and I won't find much joy while we're here,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,306,but we can keep others alive.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,307,We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,308,"""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,309,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,310,Maybe that's enough.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,311,Aye.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,312,Maybe that's enough.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,313,That's what I saw in the fire.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,314,A mountain like an arrowhead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,315,Thoros: Are you sure?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,316,We're getting close.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,317,Daenerys: Do you know what I like about you?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,318,- I honestly don't. - You're not a hero.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,319,Oh.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,320,"Well, I've been heroic on occasion."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,321,I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing and--
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,322,I don't want you to be a hero.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,323,Heroes do stupid things and they die.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,324,"Drogo, Jorah, Daario,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,325,even this... Jon Snow--
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,326,they all try to outdo each other.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,327,"Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,328,"It's interesting, these heroes you name."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,329,"Drogo, Jorah, Daario,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,330,even this... Jon Snow.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,331,They all fell in love with you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,332,"- Jon Snow's not in love with me. - Oh, my mistake."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,333,I suppose he stares at you longingly
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,334,because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,335,He's too little for me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,336,I didn't mean--
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,337,"As heroes go, he is quite little."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,338,I know you're brave.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,339,I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,340,"So, if all goes well,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,341,I'll finally get to meet your sister.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,342,"From everything you've told me about her,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,343,she'd rather murder me than speak with me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,344,"Oh, first, she'd torture you in some horrible way,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,345,then she'd murder you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,346,"Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,347,"But if we go to the capital,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,348,"we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,349,"Anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stones."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,350,"And right now, she's thinking of how to set a trap."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,351,Of course she is.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,352,And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,353,Are we?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,354,Laying any traps?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,355,"If we want to create a new and better world,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,356,I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,357,Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,358,"Yes, you'll need to be ruthless"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,359,if you're going to win the throne.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,360,You need to inspire a degree of fear.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,361,But fear is all Cersei has.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,362,"It's all my father had, and Joffrey."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,363,It makes their power brittle
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,364,because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,365,Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,366,He did.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,367,But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,368,Aegon built a wheel.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,369,"If that's the kind of queen you want to be,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,370,how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,371,So we walk into the lions' den.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,372,My brother promised me he'd keep a grip
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,373,on the Lannister forces.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,374,"Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,375,Except yours.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,376,And I promised him
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,377,I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,378,Impulsive?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,379,This will be a difficult negotiation.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,380,We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,381,My sister is likely to say something provocative.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,382,- And? - And you have been known
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,383,"to lose your temper from time to time,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,384,as all great leaders do.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,385,When have I lost my temper?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,386,"Burning the Tarlys, for instance."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,387,That was not impulsive.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,388,That was necessary.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,389,- Perhaps. - Perhaps?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,390,Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,391,Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate their mistakes
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,392,in the solitude of a cold cell.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,393,We had no time to discuss the possibilities
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,394,before you ended their possibilities.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,395,One could be forgiven for thinking you're taking
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,396,your family's side in this debate.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,397,I am taking their side.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,398,You need to take your enemy's side
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,399,if you're going to see things the way they do.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,400,And you need to see things the way they do
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,401,"if you're going to anticipate their actions,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,402,"respond effectively, and beat them."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,403,Which I want you to do very much.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,404,Because I believe in you and in the world you want to build.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,405,But the world you want to build
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,406,doesn't get built all at once.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,407,Probably not in a single lifetime.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,408,How do we ensure that your vision endures?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,409,"After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,410,You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,411,Is that it?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,412,"You say you can't have children,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,413,but there are other ways of choosing a successor.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,414,The Night's Watch has one method.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,415,"The ironborn, for all their many flaws, have another."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,416,We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,417,"Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,418,"fly towards you when you fought on the Blackwater Rush,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,419,and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,420,But any one of them could have found your heart and ended your--
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,421,"You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,422,Is this one of the items you discussed
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,423,with your brother in King's Landing?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,424,I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,425,"Perhaps if you planned for the short term,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,426,we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,427,We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,428,( wind howling )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,429,( all panting )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,430,Look!
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,431,The Hound: A bear.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,432,Big fucker.

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,449,We have to get him back to Eastwatch.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,450,Flask.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,451,Go on.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,452,- ( skin sizzling ) - ( Thoros groaning )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,453,( Thoros panting )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,454,You all right?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,455,I just got bit by a dead bear.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,456,"Aye, you did."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,457,Funny old life.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,458,"Right, then."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,459,We're off.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,460,- Where did she get it? - I don't know.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,461,She seems very resourceful.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,462,You're worried.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,463,"We're asking 20,000 men"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,464,to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,465,The weather will be the least of their problems.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,466,Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,467,- You question their loyalty? - Their loyalty is to Jon.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,468,Jon is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,469,You're the Lady of Winterfell.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,470,The king chose you to rule in his absence.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,471,And rule you have.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,472,"Wisely, ably."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,473,They see that. They respect you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,474,Some may even prefer you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,475,"Yes, they turned their backs on Jon"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,476,"when it was time to retake Winterfell,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,477,"then they named him their king,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,478,and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,479,How far would you trust men like that?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,480,They're all bloody wind vanes.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,481,"If they found out that I wrote that letter,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,482,a woman who's already married
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,483,"not one, but two enemies of her house..."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,484,"By the time Jon comes back, he'll have no army left."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,485,Arya's not like them.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,486,She's your sister.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,487,"You may have disagreements,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,488,but she would never betray her family.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,489,She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,490,Is that what she thinks?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,491,I don't know what she thinks.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,492,I don't know her anymore.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,493,Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,494,"She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,495,is she not?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,496,She is.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,497,"And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,498,wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,499,She would.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,500,- Something I've always wanted to know. - All right.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,501,How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,502,"If I'm being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,503,Some of the lads told me about it the next morning.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,504,Sounded like a good scrap.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,505,Aye.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,506,It was a proper scrap.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,507,"The ironborn thought you were some kind of god,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,508,the way you were waving that flaming sword.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,509,I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,510,Just the drunkest.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,511,( metal clanking )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,512,Where's the rest of them?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,513,"If we wait long enough, we'll find out."

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,528,Run back to Eastwatch.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,529,"Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,530,"- I'm not leaving you. - You're the fastest. Go, now."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,531,You're faster without the hammer. Give it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,532,Give it!
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,533,- Come on! - Run!
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,534,Tormund: Come on!
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,535,( cracking )

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,548,What happened?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,549,Where are the others?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,550,"Raven, we need to send a raven."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,551,"Get the maester, now!"

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,556,Thoros?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,557,Thoros.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,558,They say it's one of the better ways to go.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,559,"Beric: Lord of Light, show us the way."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,560,Come to us in our darkness and lead Your servant into the light.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,561,We have to burn his body.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,562,We'll all be close behind him
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,563,unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,564,"Beric: Lord of Light,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,565,"come to us in our darkness,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,566,for the night is dark and full of terrors.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,567,( snarling )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,568,We'll all freeze soon.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,569,And so will the water.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,570,"When you killed the white walker,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,571,almost all the dead that followed it fell.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,572,Why?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,573,Maybe he was the one who turned them.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,574,We can go for the walkers.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,575,- Maybe we'll stand a chance. - Jon: No.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,576,We need to take that thing back with us.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,577,Jon: There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,578,Daenerys is our only chance.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,579,No. There's another.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,580,Kill him.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,581,Beric: He turned them all.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,582,You don't understand.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,583,Beric: The Lord brought you back.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,584,He brought me back.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,585,No one else. Just us.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,586,Did He do it to watch us freeze to death?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,587,"Careful, Beric. You lost your priest."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,588,This is your last life.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,589,I've been waiting for the end for a long time.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,590,Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,591,Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,592,Don't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,593,Wolkan: My lady.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,594,My lady?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,595,It's an invitation to King's Landing.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,596,"My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,597,"I am, and you will represent my interests"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,598,at this gathering as you see them.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,599,They invited you. They want you there.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,600,I will not set foot in King's Landing
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,601,while Cersei Lannister is queen.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,602,"If they want another Stark prisoner,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,603,they can come and take me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,604,"Until then, I'll remain where I belong."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,605,I have work to do here.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,606,- ( paper thuds ) - ( fire crackling )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,607,It's not safe.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,608,Ser Jaime will be there.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,609,You said he treated you honorably before.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,610,I'm not worried about me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,611,It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,612,I have many guards who would happily
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,613,imprison him or behead him
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,614,whether or not you're here.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,615,And you trust their loyalty?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,616,You trust he hasn't been speaking to them all behind your back?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,617,Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,618,He has become a competent swordsman--
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,619,I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,620,"I'm not a child,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,621,"I am the Lady of Winterfell, and I am home."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,622,This is the safest place for me.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,623,"My lady,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,624,I swore an oath to protect you and your sister.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,625,"- If I abandon you-- - The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,626,and you won't be traveling on summer roads.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,627,"The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,628,"Yes, my lady."

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,630,( dragons snarling )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,631,You can't.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,632,The most important person in the world
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,633,can't fly off to the most dangerous place in the world.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,634,- Who else can? - No one.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,635,They knew the risks when they left.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,636,You can't win the throne if you're dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,637,You can't break the wheel if you're dead.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,638,"So, what would you have me do?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,639,Nothing.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,640,Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,641,"If you die, we're all lost."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,642,"Everyone, everything."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,643,You told me to do nothing before and I listened to you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,644,I'm not doing nothing again.

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,720,"I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,721,They're not here now.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,722,What are these?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,723,My faces.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,724,Where did you get them?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,725,"In Braavos, while I was training to be a Faceless Man."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,726,What does that mean?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,727,"Back in Braavos,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,728,"before I got my first face,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,729,there was a game I used to play.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,730,The Game of Faces.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,731,It's simple--
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,732,"I ask you a question about yourself,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,733,and you try to make lies sound like the truth.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,734,"If you fool me, you win."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,735,"If I catch a lie, you lose."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,736,Let's play.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,737,I don't want to play.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,738,How do you feel about Jon being king?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,739,Is there someone else you think should rule the North instead of him?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,740,"Those faces, what are they?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,741,You want to do the asking?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,742,Are you sure?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,743,The Game of Faces didn't turn out so well
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,744,for the last person who asked me questions.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,745,Tell me what they are.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,746,We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,747,"You wanted to be a queen,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,748,"to sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,749,"I wanted to be a knight,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,750,to pick up a sword like Father and go off to battle.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,751,"Neither of us got to be that other person, did we?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,752,The world doesn't just let girls decide what they're going to be.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,753,But I can now.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,754,"With the faces, I can choose."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,755,I can become someone else.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,756,"Speak in their voice,"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,757,live in their skin.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,758,I could even become you.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,759,I wonder what it would feel like
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,760,to wear those pretty dresses...
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,761,to be the Lady of Winterfell.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,762,All I'd need to find out...
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,763,is your face.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,764,( gasps )
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,765,I'm sorry.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,766,I'm so sorry.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,767,I wish I could take it back.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,768,I wish we'd never gone.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,769,I don't.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,770,"If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,771,You have to see it to know.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,772,Now I know.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,773,The dragons are my children.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,774,They're the only children I'll ever have.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,775,Do you understand?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,776,We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,777,And we'll do it together.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,778,You have my word.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,779,"Thank you, Dany."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,780,"""Dany""?"

S07E06,Beyond The Wall,782,Who was the last person who called me that?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,783,I'm not sure. Was it my brother?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,784,"Mm, not the company you want to keep."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,785,All right.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,786,"Not ""Dany."""
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,787,"How about ""my queen""?"
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,788,"I'd, uh, bend the knee, but..."
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,789,What about those who swore allegiance to you?
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,790,They'll all come to see you for what you are.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,791,I hope I deserve it.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,792,You do.
S07E06,Beyond The Wall,793,You should get some rest.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,5,You will represent my interests
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,6,at this gathering as you see them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,7,It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,8,LITTLEFINGER: She's your sister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,9,Arya would never betray her family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,10,SANSA STARK: She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,11,"With the faces, I can become someone else."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,12,I wonder what it would feel like to be the Lady of Winterfell.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,13,All I'd need to find out... is your face.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,14,Daenerys will win this war.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,15,"If you want Cersei to bend the knee,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,16,you can ask her yourself.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,17,She has a more important request.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,18,Cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,19,but a story. What if we prove her wrong?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,20,Bring the dead to her.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,39,Gold?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,40,I spent my life around soldiers.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,41,What do you think they spend that gold on?

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,43,"Not without a cock, you don't."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,44,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,45,"Yet, your brother has chosen to side with the cockless."

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,56,Why would anyone want to live that way?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,57,There's more work in the city.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,106,The only one that needs protecting
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,107,is the one that gets in her way.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,108,It won't be me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,109,Tyrion: Here we are--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,110,the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,112,"It is, my lord."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,113,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,114,Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,115,I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,116,if she ends up on the throne.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,117,You've been thinking about our new queen?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,118,Perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,119,Remember my offer--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,120,"whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,121,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,122,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,129,"Now, thanks to me,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,130,she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,131,She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,132,of the clever words that pour out their pieholes.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,133,All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,134,"If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,135,It's good to see you again.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,136,"Yeah, you, too."

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,141,I left this shit city
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,142,because I didn't want to die in it.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,144,You might.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,145,And this is all your idea.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,146,Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,147,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,152,What did they do to you?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,153,Doesn't matter.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,165,We've been here for some time.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,166,My apologies.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,167,We are all facing a unique--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,168,Euron: Theon!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,169,I have your sister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,170,"If you don't submit to me here, now..."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,171,I'll kill her.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,172,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,173,Then why are you talking?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,174,You're the smallest concern here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,175,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,176,His wasn't even good.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,177,He explained it at the end.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,178,Never explain. It always ruins it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,179,We don't even let your kind live
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,180,"in the Iron Islands, you know?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,181,We kill you at birth.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,182,An act of mercy for the parents.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,183,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,184,Why?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,185,Sit down or leave.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,187,"We are a group of people who do not like one another,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,188,as this recent demonstration has shown.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,189,We have suffered at each other's hands.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,190,We have lost people we love at each other's hands.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,191,"If all we wanted was more of the same,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,192,there would be no need for this gathering.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,193,We are entirely capable of waging war against each other
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,194,without meeting face-to-face.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,195,"So instead, we should settle our differences"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,196,and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,197,We all know that will never happen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,198,Then why are we here?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,199,This isn't about living in harmony.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,200,It's just about living.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,201,The same thing is coming for all of us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,202,A general you can't negotiate with.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,203,An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,204,Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,205,They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,206,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,207,This is serious.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,208,I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,209,I don't think it's serious at all.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,210,I think it's another bad joke.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,211,"If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,212,you're asking me for a truce.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,213,Yes. That's all.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,214,That's all?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,215,Pull back my armies and stand down
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,216,while you go on your monster hunt.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,217,Or while you solidify and expand your position.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,218,Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,219,until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,220,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,221,You have my word.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,222,The word of a would-be usurper.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,223,There is no conversation
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,224,that will erase the last 50 years.

S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,233,And we can destroy them with dragonglass.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,234,"If we don't win this fight,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,235,then that is the fate of every person in the world.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,236,( grunts )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,237,There is only one war that matters--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,238,the Great War.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,239,And it is here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,240,Daenerys: I didn't believe it until I saw them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,241,I saw them all.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,242,How many?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,243,"A hundred thousand, at least."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,244,Can they swim?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,245,No.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,246,Good.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,247,I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,248,What are you talking about?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,249,I've been around the world.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,250,"I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,251,and this...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,252,this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,253,I'm going back to my island.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,254,You should go back to yours.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,255,"When winter's over,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,256,we'll be the only ones left alive.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,257,Cersei: He's right to be afraid.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,258,And a coward to run.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,259,"If those things come for us,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,260,there will be no kingdoms to rule.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,261,Everything we suffered will have been for nothing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,262,Everything we lost will have been for nothing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,263,The crown accepts your truce.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,264,"Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,265,( sighs )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,266,"In return, the King in the North will extend this truce."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,267,He will remain in the North where he belongs.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,268,He will not take up arms against the Lannisters.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,269,He will not choose sides.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,270,Daenerys: Just the King in the North?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,271,- Not me? - ( Cersei chuckles )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,272,I would never ask it of you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,273,You would never agree to it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,274,"And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,275,I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,276,I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,277,I am true to my word.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,278,Or I try to be.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,279,That is why I cannot give you what you ask.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,280,I cannot serve two queens.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,281,And I have already pledged myself
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,282,to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,283,Then there is nothing left to discuss.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,284,The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,285,We will deal with whatever is left of you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,286,Brienne: Ser Jaime.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,287,It's been good to see you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,288,I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,289,We both saw what just happened.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,290,We both saw that... thing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,291,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,292,"But I'm loyal to the queen,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,293,and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,294,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,295,Fuck loyalty?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,296,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,297,Talk to the queen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,298,And tell her what?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,299,Davos: I wish you hadn't done that.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,300,"I'm grateful for your loyalty,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,301,but my dragon died so that we could be here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,302,"If it's all for nothing,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,303,then he died for nothing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,304,I know!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,305,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,306,"I would have advised it, had you asked."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,307,But have you ever considered
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,308,learning how to lie every now and then?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,309,Just a bit?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,310,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,311,"Talk about my father if you want,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,312,tell me that's the attitude that got him killed.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,313,"But when enough people make false promises,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,314,words stop meaning anything.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,315,"Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,316,And lies won't help us in this fight.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,317,Tyrion: That is indeed a problem.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,318,The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,319,Any ideas as to how we might
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,320,change that state of affairs?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,321,Only one.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,322,"Everyone stays here,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,323,and I go and talk to my sister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,324,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,325,I don't want Cersei to murder me either.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,326,I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,327,Jon: I did this.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,328,- I should go. - She'll definitely murder you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,329,I go see my sister alone.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,330,Or we all go home
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,331,and we're right back where we started.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,332,- You spoke with her? - At her until she kicked me out.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,333,She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,334,"A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,335,I'm about to step into a room
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,336,with the most murderous woman in the world
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,337,"who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,338,Who's an idiot?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,339,"I suppose we should say goodbye,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,340,one idiot to another.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,341,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,342,She's your kind of woman--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,343,a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,344,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,345,That must be difficult for you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,346,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,347,- whom you've convinced to bow down before her. - I didn't know about that.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,348,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,349,the goal you've worked towards your entire life...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,350,"- Cersei, I didn't know. - ...the destruction of this family."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,351,I am the one preventing that from happening.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,352,Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,353,She didn't want to bring you words.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,354,She wanted to bring you fire and blood
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,355,until I advised her otherwise.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,356,I don't want to destroy our family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,357,I never have.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,358,You killed our father.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,359,After he sentenced me to death
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,360,"for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,361,Hate me for it if you want.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,362,"I hate myself for it in spite of what he was,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,363,in spite of what he did to me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,364,"Oh, poor little man."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,365,Your papa was mean to you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,366,Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,367,You left us open.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,368,"You laid us bare for the vultures,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,369,and the vultures came and tore us apart.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,370,"You may not have killed Joffrey,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,371,"but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,372,No one would've touched them if Father was here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,373,- No one would have dared-- - I have never been more sorry about anything.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,374,"I will not hear it, not from you."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,375,I will not hear it!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,376,All right.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,377,"You love your family,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,378,and I have destroyed it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,379,I will always be a threat.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,380,So put an end to me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,381,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,382,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,383,"If it weren't for me,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,384,you'd have two beautiful children.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,385,I've thought about killing you
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,386,more times than I can count.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,387,Do it! Say the word.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,388,( sighs )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,389,( pants )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,390,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,391,- I will not-- - I don't care. I loved them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,392,You know I did.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,393,You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,394,It doesn't matter.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,395,Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,396,I don't care why you did what you did.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,397,I only care what it cost us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,398,It cost us our future.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,399,"If there's no future, then why are we here?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,400,Why did you allow me to come?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,401,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,402,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,403,but you must have hoped for something.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,404,What did you hope for?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,405,"- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen? - Mm, not like this."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,406,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,407,- Yes. - Why?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,408,Because I think
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,409,she will make the world a better place.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,410,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,411,She knows herself.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,412,She chose an advisor
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,413,who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,414,That's the difference between you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,415,I don't care about checking my worst impulses.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,416,I don't care about making the world a better place.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,417,Hang the world.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,418,"That thing you dragged here,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,419,"I know what it is, I know what it means."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,420,"And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,421,Not at all.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,422,"As soon as it opened its mouth,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,423,"the world disappeared for me,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,424,right down its black throat.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,425,All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,426,"away from the ones who matter most,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,427,away from my family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,428,Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,429,"Get on a boat, take those who matter--"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,430,You're pregnant.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,431,( sighs )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,432,No one is less happy about this than I am.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,433,I know.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,434,I respect what you did.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,435,"Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,436,This place was the beginning of the end for my family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,437,( speaking Valyrian )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,438,A dragon is not a slave.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,439,They were terrifying.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,440,Extraordinary.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,441,"They filled people with wonder and awe,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,442,and we locked them in here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,443,They wasted away.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,444,They grew small.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,445,And we grew small as well.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,446,We weren't extraordinary without them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,447,We were just like everyone else.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,448,You're not like everyone else.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,449,And your family hasn't seen its end.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,450,You're still here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,451,I can't have children.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,452,Who told you that?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,453,The witch who murdered my husband.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,454,Has it occurred to you she might not have been
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,455,a reliable source of information?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,456,You were right from the beginning.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,457,"If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,458,"So, what now?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,459,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,460,And I can't pretend that Cersei
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,461,won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,462,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,463,We're fucked.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,464,( footsteps approaching )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,465,( footsteps approaching )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,466,My armies will not stand down.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,467,I will not pull them back to the capital.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,468,I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,469,The darkness is coming for us all.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,470,We'll face it together.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,471,"And when the Great War is over,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,472,perhaps you'll remember I chose to help
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,473,with no promises or assurances from any of you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,474,I expect not.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,475,Call our banners.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,476,All of them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,477,- ( wind howling ) - ( cawing )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,478,Littlefinger: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,479,Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,480,"No, this is the way he is,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,481,the way he's always been.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,482,He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,483,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,484,"This is his writing, his signature."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,485,He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,486,He's bent the knee.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,487,I've heard gossip
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,488,that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,489,What does that have to do with anything?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,490,Jon is young and unmarried.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,491,Daenerys is young and unmarried.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,492,You think he wants to marry her?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,493,An alliance makes sense.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,494,"Together, they'd be difficult to defeat."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,495,He was named King in the North.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,496,He can be unnamed.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,497,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,498,"She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,499,and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,500,"You are family, too."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,501,Would Arya really murder her own sister?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,502,Do you know what she is now?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,503,Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,504,Only by reputation.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,505,"They worship the God of Death, I believe."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,506,I never trust godly men.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,507,They're killers.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,508,And Arya was one of them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,509,What do you think she's after?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,510,She's your sister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,511,You know her far better than I ever could.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,512,"Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,513,I play a little game.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,514,I assume the worst.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,515,What's the worst reason they could possibly have
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,516,for saying what they say and doing what they do?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,517,"Then I ask myself,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,518,"""How well does that reason explain"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,519,"what they say and what they do?"""
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,520,"So, tell me--"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,521,what's the worst thing she could want?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,522,She could want me dead
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,523,because she thinks I wronged my family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,524,Why did she come to Winterfell?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,525,To kill me
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,526,for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,527,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,528,To provide proof of my betrayals.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,529,To provide justification after she murders me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,530,"And after she murders you,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,531,what does she become?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,532,Lady of Winterfell.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,533,( waves crashing )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,534,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,535,they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,536,And the Unsullied?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,537,"We can sail with them to White Harbor,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,538,"meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,539,then ride together to Winterfell.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,540,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,541,You have many enemies in the North.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,542,Thousands fell fighting your father.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,543,All it takes is one angry man with a crossbow.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,544,He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,545,and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,546,The man who killed the conqueror.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,547,"Jon: It's your decision, Your Grace."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,548,"But if we're going to be allies in this war,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,549,it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,550,"If we sail to White Harbor together,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,551,I think it sends a better message.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,552,I've not come to conquer the North.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,553,I'm coming to save the North.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,554,We sail together.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,555,Jon.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,556,Can I speak with you?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,557,All right.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,558,"What you did in King's Landing,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,559,what you said...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,560,you could've lied to Cersei
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,561,about bending the knee to Daenerys.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,562,You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,563,We went down there to make peace.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,564,And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,565,if we're going to fight together.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,566,You've always known what was right.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,567,"Even when we were all young and stupid,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,568,you always knew.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,569,Every step you take...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,570,it's always the right step.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,571,It's not.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,572,"It may seem that way from the outside,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,573,"but I promise you, it's not true."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,574,I've done plenty of things that I regret.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,575,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,576,No.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,577,Not compared to you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,578,I always wanted to do the right thing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,579,Be the right kind of person.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,580,But I never knew what that meant.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,581,It always seemed like there's...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,582,like there was an impossible choice I had to make.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,583,Stark or Greyjoy.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,584,Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,585,- He was. - And you betrayed him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,586,Betrayed his memory.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,587,I did.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,588,( sighs )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,589,But you never lost him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,590,He's a part of you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,591,Just like he's a part of me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,592,But the things I've done...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,593,It's not my place to forgive you for all of it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,594,"But what I can forgive,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,595,I do.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,596,You don't need to choose.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,597,You're a Greyjoy...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,598,and you're a Stark.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,599,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,600,Yara tried to save me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,601,She's the only one
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,602,who tried to save me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,603,( sniffles )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,604,She needs me now.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,605,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,606,Harrag: Load up.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,607,"Load up, lads. Go on."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,608,- ( chatter ) - Tide's coming in.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,609,All of us chose to follow Yara.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,610,We left the Iron Islands for Yara.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,611,She would never leave one of us behind.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,612,We're not leaving her behind.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,613,Your sister's dead.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,614,- She's not dead. - She's dead.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,615,"Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,616,"- She's our queen. - She's your sister, and you left her to die."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,617,I did.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,618,I ran from my uncle.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,619,I was a coward.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,620,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,621,They say the dead can't swim.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,622,"We're going to sail east,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,623,"find a nice, quiet island,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,624,"kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,625,- We're done with all that. - Who says we are?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,626,Yara did. She made a pledge.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,627,"We're going to find her,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,628,and we're going to set her free.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,629,- ( spits ) - ( men laugh )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,630,"Run away, little Theon."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,631,It's what you do best.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,632,Man: He needs to shut his mouth.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,633,( men cheering )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,634,- Man: Hey! - ( men laughing )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,635,"- ( shouts ) - Man ♪2: Oh, yes!"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,636,- Man ♪3: That's more like it. - ( men laughing )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,637,( grunts )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,638,Stay down...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,639,or I'll kill you!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,640,( grunts )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,641,I said stay down or I'll kill you!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,642,( shouting )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,643,( grunting )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,644,( grunts )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,645,( shouts )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,646,( grunting )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,647,( pants )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,648,Not for me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,649,For Yara!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,650,Men: Yara!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,651,Have my sister brought to the Great Hall.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,652,Are you sure you want to do this?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,653,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,654,And what does honor demand?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,655,That I defend my family from those who would harm us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,656,That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,657,"All right, then."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,658,Get on with it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,659,You stand accused of murder.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,660,You stand accused of treason.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,661,How do you answer these charges...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,662,Lord Baelish?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,663,My sister asked you a question.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,664,"Lady Sansa, forgive me..."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,665,I'm a bit confused.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,666,Which charges confuse you?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,667,Let's start with the simplest one--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,668,"you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,669,You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,670,Do you deny it?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,671,I did it to protect you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,672,You did it to take power in the Vale.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,673,"Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,674,You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,675,Do you deny it?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,676,Whatever your aunt might have told you...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,677,she was a troubled woman.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,678,She imagined enemies everywhere.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,679,You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,680,telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,681,"when, really, it was you."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,682,"The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,683,it was you who started it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,684,Do you deny it?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,685,I know of no such letter.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,686,You conspired with Cersei Lannister
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,687,"and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,688,"Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,689,and later executed on false charges of treason.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,690,- Do you deny it? - I deny it!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,691,None of you were there to see what happened.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,692,None of you knows the truth.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,693,You held a knife to his throat.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,694,"You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,695,You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,696,But that was another one of your lies.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,697,It was yours.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,698,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,699,- I've protected you. - Protected me?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,700,By selling me to the Boltons?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,701,"If we could speak alone,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,702,I can explain everything.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,703,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,704,I play a little game.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,705,I assume the worst.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,706,What's the worst reason you have
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,707,for turning me against my sister?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,708,"That's what you do, isn't it?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,709,That's what you've always done--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,710,"turn family against family,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,711,turn sister against sister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,712,"That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,713,and that's what you tried to do to us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,714,"Sansa, please."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,715,"I'm a slow learner, it's true."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,716,But I learn.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,717,Give me a chance to defend myself.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,718,I deserve that.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,719,I am Lord Protector of the Vale
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,720,and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,721,I think not.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,722,"Sansa, I beg you!"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,723,I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,724,"And yet, you betrayed her."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,725,I loved you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,726,More than anyone.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,727,"And yet, you betrayed me."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,728,"When you brought me back to Winterfell,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,729,"you told me there's no justice in the world,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,730,not unless we make it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,731,"Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,732,I will never forget them.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,733,Sansa!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,734,( gasps )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,735,I...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,736,Jaime: Our men in King's Landing
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,737,will march north in three days' time.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,738,Man: It'll take us a fortnight
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,739,just to gather supplies for the train.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,740,Jaime: We don't have a fortnight.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,741,"If the North falls, we fall. Three days."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,742,The remaining forces in the Westerlands
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,743,will take the river road east.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,744,We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,745,and march together to Winterfell.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,746,Ser Jaime.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,747,Your Grace.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,748,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,749,Men: Your Grace.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,750,- What are you doing? - Preparing the expedition north.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,751,Expedition north?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,752,I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,753,"The Starks and Targaryens have united against us,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,754,and you want to fight alongside them?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,755,Are you a traitor or an idiot?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,756,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,757,I'll say whatever I need to say
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,758,to ensure the survival of our house.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,759,You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,760,"You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,761,to fight for the Dragon Queen?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,762,You saw it with your own eyes.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,763,You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,764,I saw it burn.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,765,"If dragons can't stop them,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,766,"if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,767,how will our armies make a difference?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,768,"This isn't about noble houses,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,769,this is about the living and the dead!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,770,And I intend to stay amongst the living.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,771,Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,772,We stay here where we've always been.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,773,I made a promise.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,774,Our child will rule Westeros.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,775,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,776,The monsters are real.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,777,"The white walkers,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,778,"the dragons, the Dothraki screamers--"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,779,"all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,780,So be it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,781,Let the monsters kill each other.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,782,"And while they battle in the North,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,783,we take back the lands that belong to us.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,784,- And then what? - And then we rule.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,785,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,786,"You understand that, don't you?"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,787,"If the dead win, they march south and kill us all."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,788,"If the living win, and we've betrayed them,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,789,they march south and kill us all!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,790,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,791,Most of them will die in the North.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,792,I faced them in the field.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,793,We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,794,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,795,- Two. - What happened to the third?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,796,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,797,She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,798,She came here to show us all her power.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,799,"No, something happened. The dragons are vulnerable."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,800,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,801,We don't have the support of the other houses!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,802,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,803,You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,804,"Oh, I know it's boring for you."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,805,You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,806,"But I listened, I learned."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,807,Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,808,the Golden Company.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,809,"20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,810,The Golden Company is not here.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,811,They're in Essos.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,812,How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,813,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,814,and sailed back to the Iron Islands?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,815,Do you think he abandoned
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,816,the chance to marry the queen?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,817,No one walks away from me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,818,He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,819,He's going to ferry the Golden Company back here
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,820,to help us win the war for Westeros.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,821,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,822,the commander of your armies?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,823,"And you conspired with Tyrion,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,824,"the man who murdered our father,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,825,"without telling me, your queen."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,826,I didn't conspire with him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,827,You met with him in secret without my consent.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,828,You planned to promote my enemies' interests.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,829,That is the definition of conspiracy.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,830,I pledged to ride north.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,831,I intend to honor that pledge.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,832,- And that will be treason. - Treason?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,833,"Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,834,What would you call it?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,835,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,836,I told you no one walks away from me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,837,Are you going to order him to kill me?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,838,I'm the only one you have left.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,839,"Our children are gone, our father is gone."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,840,It's just me and you now.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,841,There's one more yet to come.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,842,"Give the order, then."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,843,I don't believe you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,844,( chatter )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,845,- ( knocking on door ) - Come in.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,846,Samwell Tarly.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,847,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,848,I remember everything.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,849,( door closes )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,850,You helped us get beyond the Wall.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,851,"- You're a good man. - Oh, well, thank you,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,852,"but, um, I'm not sure that I am."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,853,What happened to you beyond the Wall?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,854,I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,855,Oh!
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,856,I don't know what that means.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,857,I can see things that happened in the past.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,858,I can see things happening now
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,859,all over the world.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,860,Why did you come to Winterfell?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,861,Um...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,862,Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,863,I know he is.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,864,"But he can't do it alone,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,865,so I've come here to help him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,866,He's on his way back to Winterfell
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,867,with Daenerys Targaryen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,868,You-- you saw this in--
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,869,in a vision?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,870,Oh.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,871,He needs to know the truth.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,872,The truth about what?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,873,About himself.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,874,No one knows. No one but me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,875,Jon isn't really my father's son.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,876,"He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,877,He was born in a tower in Dorne.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,878,"His last name isn't really Snow,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,879,it's Sand.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,880,It's not.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,881,Dornish bastards are named Sand.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,882,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,883,He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,884,He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,885,Are you certain?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,886,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,887,I don't know why he'd lie.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,888,Is this something you can see?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,889,"Rhaegar and Lyanna: Father, Smith, Warrior,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,890,"Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,891,- I am hers and she is mine... - I am his and he is mine...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,892,from this day until the end of my days.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,893,Bran's voice: Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,894,Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt or rape her.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,895,He loved her.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,896,And she loved him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,897,- Bran's voice: And Jon... - ( baby crying )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,898,Jon's real name...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,899,His name is Aegon Targaryen.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,900,You have to protect him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,901,"Promise me, Ned."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,902,( panting )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,903,Bran's voice: He's never been a bastard.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,904,( panting )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,905,Bran's voice: He's the heir to the Iron Throne.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,906,Bran's voice: He needs to know.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,907,We need to tell him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,908,Are you all right?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,909,It's just strange.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,910,"In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,911,You did the right thing.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,912,You did it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,913,I'm just the executioner.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,914,You passed the sentence.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,915,You're the Lady of Winterfell.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,916,Does that bother you?
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,917,I was never going to be as good a lady as you.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,918,So I had to be something else.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,919,I never could have survived what you survived.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,920,You would have.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,921,You're the strongest person I know.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,922,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,923,"Well, don't get used to it."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,924,You're still very strange and annoying.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,925,"""In winter, we must protect ourselves."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,926,"Look after one another."""
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,927,Father.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,928,"""When the snows fall and the white winds blow,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,929,"the lone wolf dies,"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,930,"but the pack survives."""
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,931,I miss him.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,932,"Me, too."
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,933,( birds cawing )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,934,( chatter )
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,935,Beric: It's a long way down.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,936,Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,937,Man: I can see movement...
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,938,"Watch, on the tree line!"
S07E07,The Dragon And The Wolf,939,Man ♪2: What is it?
